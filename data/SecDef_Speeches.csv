"March 30, 2015","Good morning everyone! What a great looking crowd! I used to sit right down there. Good morning and thanks for that. And thank you Kayla for a wonderful and warm introduction and for your ambition to join us in your Department of Defense. Kayla is obviously bright and driven, like many of you in the school here. And we’re very much looking forward to having her join our ranks. I also want to thank our Congressman who is here, for joining us, Congressman Boyle. He went to Cardinal Dougherty, so – but he seemed to have done all right, despite that, not being an Abington graduate.  But he represents this place in Congress. And it’s great to be back here at Abington. I feel so fortunate to have begun my life in Abington High School. And you have today – I’m so admiring of the leadership that your school has – Superintendent Sichel, very well-known around the country and celebrated superintendent; your wonderful principal, Mr. Berrios; and, by the way, the principal in my day, Norm Schmidt, who’s here also. Now, I don’t know about you, but in my day, we revered the superintendent, we respected the principal, but the assistant principal…we really just feared. And we have a couple of them also. In fact, I was just taken into the principal’s office, and it was a throwback: my heart started to beat quickly, remembering what I had done. So a lot’s changed, but a few things that haven’t, one is that Abington is still, as we used to hear every morning, “first in the alphabet, first in achievement” – or academics, I guess – “and first in athletics.” And in that connection, I was – did three sports when I was here, and two of my coaches of here, and the wife of a third coach. I just want to mention them a minute, not because I was so good – actually, I really wasn’t... I – Mr. Gavagan’s here and can speak to my career as a cross-country runner. And what I remember about Mr. Gavagan was him standing out there on the field with – and he’d look at his stopwatch, and he’d say, ""Carter, I don’t even know why I use this. I should get a calendar for you."" And then Mr. Roeder was my wrestling coach. I was also not so good at that. But the only thing I was even half-good at was lacrosse, and my coach in those days was the legendary “Doc” Jurich. And Joanne, his wife, is here today somewhere, and I just wanted to give a shout out to you, Joanne, and to ""Doc."" …Three great coaches. Three great coaches. And – and by the way, Mr. Roeder was my physics teacher too. And I told him this morning – it’s really true – I wouldn’t be a physicist if it weren’t for Mr. Roeder. And I wouldn’t – I know that I wouldn’t be where I am now without Abington High School. And so for all those people who are part of my past and are now part of your future, thank you. So I wanted to come here today to talk to you, because your generation is the future of our country, and the future of our national security. And we now have the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and we’re blessed to have that…And they’re not just defending our country against terrorists in places like Afghanistan and Syria and Iraq; they’re helping to defend cyberspace, as Kayla indicated also.  They’re working with cutting-edge technologies, like robotics and biomedical engineering. When disaster strikes, they deliver aid all over the world, from the nuclear-reactor meltdown in Japan to Superstorm Sandy here in the United States.  And they mobilized to Africa to save thousands of lives, helping keep the deadly Ebola virus from spreading around the world. So our country’s military’s missions continue to evolve rapidly as our world changes and as technology continues to revolutionize everything we do. What all this means is that the institution that I lead, the Department of Defense, has to keep pace with that change as well – to keep our nation secure. We speak in acronyms at the Pentagon, and one of them is “BLUF,” B-L-U-F. It stands for Bottom Line Up Front, where you tell somebody the meat of what you have to say right away. So let me tell you the BLUF of what I want to say to you.  I’ve made a commitment to the men and women in uniform, to President Obama and to the American people that as Secretary of Defense, I will drive change to build what I call the force of the future: the military and the broader Defense Department that we need to serve and defend our country in the years to come. And that is the vision that I want to talk to you about today. Movies like American Sniper, video games like Call of Duty, TV commercials with troops coming, home – you see all those – and they’re most likely where you see our military every day, unless you have a family member or a friend who’s serving.  And while all those images are somewhat true, they’re only a slice of what our military does on a daily basis. The jobs and lives and stories of our military are as varied as the 2.3 million members we have. Because we too often talk about sacrifice alone, which is no small thing, we probably don’t spend enough time highlighting the opportunities that exist and the fulfillment one has from achieving excellence and doing it in service to your country. No one should gloss over the hardships or the dangers of military life, but I do want you to understand how fulfilling and rewarding military life can be also. If you ask people just like you, people like the over 150 Abington graduates who’ve joined the military, both before and after college, since 2000 – or anyone else who serves about what military life is really like, they’d tell you that they have friends, that they’re able to have a family. And even on bases around the world, they’ve been watching March Madness, too. Some are doing all of this, as enlisted personnel, those who signed up right after high school – who will pursue college education over time – while others are in college participating in R.O.T.C. programs. I stress these two approaches to let you know that, in all cases, college and higher learning are encouraged – encouraged – because we need our sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines to be the best and the brightest this country has to offer.  That’s why nearly 40% of our officers come out of in R.O.T.C. programs at colleges and universities around the country. And we send many of them to top-notch graduate programs, like civil engineering at M.I.T., medical school at Stanford, Penn’s Wharton Business School.  Plus, everyone who serves can get college benefits through the G.I. Bill which has helped over 1.3 million Americans pay for college over the past 5 ½ years – 1.3 million college educations. Our men and women in uniform would also tell you that not only are most days more exciting than they expected, but also that they’ve been empowered with more opportunities and more responsibilities than they ever could have imagined. And they tell you how satisfying it is to be part of something bigger than yourself with people who become their closest friends. Ask Lieutenant Matt Capps Abington Class of 2000, who’s currently a Navy helicopter pilot stationed in Hawaii. That sounds pretty good already, right? He’s also married, two boys. And because he decided to join the military, he’s been able to literally travel around the world, make the closest of friends and even get his MBA from Drexel. He’ll tell you that serving his country was, as he put it, one of the best decisions he’s ever made, second only to marrying his wife Alison. Some of you might know Matt’s mom, Carole, who still works here at Abington. I know how proud she is of Matt. We’re all proud of him, too. Now you don’t have to...Where? Is Carole here? Say hi to Matt. Now you don’t have to join the military to serve your country. I didn’t. But Matt and all those other Abington graduates are the foundation of our future force. There are lots of other pieces, too, like having the best technology, the best planes, ships, and tanks. But it all starts and ends with our people. If we can’t continue to attract, inspire, and excite talented young Americans like you, then nothing else will matter. Our military is so magnificent, both because of what it’s become and what it’s always been.  Our troops today are the latest in a long line of American patriots stretching back over 200 years, whether in Fallujah or in Helmand, recently, they’ve carried out the proud traditions you read about in history classes from Lexington, Concord, Gettysburg and Normandy. And today our force is made up entirely of volunteers. Everyone has their own reasons for joining. And over the last decade or so, many signed up because our country was attacked on September 11th, 2001, and because of the threat of terrorism that’s still with us today. But in the coming years, as the so-called 9/11 generation begins to leave our ranks, the Defense Department must continue to bring in talented Americans from your generation and others. That starts with being honest about our challenges in attracting people we need and want. For one thing, fewer young Americans are capable of serving in the military. Of the 21 million Americans aged 17-to-21, we estimate that only about half are able to meet our high-quality standards on our entry exam – only about half. And when you factor in our standards for physical fitness and for character, only about a third are actually eligible to join the military. And as people already in our military retire or move on to new opportunities in life, we have to bring in about 250,000 each year just to keep up. We’ve got another challenge also just over the horizon, actually because of good news in our economy. As our growing economy creates more civilian jobs, which is a good thing obviously, we’re going to have to work harder to compete to keep bringing in America’s best and brightest to our military. And when it comes to recruiting some of the most highly skilled parts of our force, like cybersecurity specialists, who are also in high demand in corporate America, we’ll have to be even more creative, because we’re going to need a lot more of them in the years to come. To meet all these challenges, the Defense Department has to think hard about how to attract, inspire, and excite people like you. Now, look, I know each and every one of us is different. And I remember that when I was a teenager, one of America’s most popular magazines had an article on its cover calling us in that generation – and I quote – ""lazy cop-outs."" When one generation talks about the next, there’s always a sense that “the kids these days have it too easy.” And one day, even you guys will begin to talk that way and start to say, ""When I was your age,"" and so on. But the fact is, we’re all shaped by the world around us. I grew up during the Cold War, when it was us versus the Soviet Union – and that drove a lot of how we thought and what we did. You were born a decade after the Cold War ended. Some of you have only dim memories, I know, of 9/11; others may not remember it all. My daughter was only eight years old on 9/11. And like my kids, you’ve grown up using technology as second nature, which has probably helped you learn more than any prior generation about all the opportunities life can offer. Technology has also given you an unprecedented ability to collaborate, create, make your voice heard, and be more globally-minded in all you do. And maybe that’s part of why you’re not just more diverse, but also more open and tolerant than past generations. All these things make your generation unique, and all these things make you attractive to us. [But] some things don’t change. You’re just as devoted to living lives of service and purpose as the generations that were – won World War II, fought for civil rights, and drove the Internet revolution that’s reshaped our politics, economy, society, and culture. And we need the finest among you in the next year to lend your skill and talent to securing our country and helping make a better world. So, to get you to join, we need to better understand your generation. Not just who you are, but also what you value. Every year since 1975, the University of Michigan has been asking high school seniors what they value in life. You can probably guess the concept themes – they want interesting jobs, strong friendships, a good family life, the ability to succeed and give their kids better opportunities than they had. That’s the American dream. But a few things have changed.  For one, your generation values more than just having a job and a family. Compared to 30 years ago, people your age are more likely to want a job where you can try and experience new things. You’re more committed to being leaders in your communities, and you care more about taking on responsibility and making a difference in the world around you. I know many of you here at Abington already have a strong sense of service and commitment to making the world a better place – you’ve raised thousands of dollars to help children with cancer, for example. You’re also more likely to go to college than your parents and grandparents – something I know many of you are thinking about this very week.  And once you get into the workplace, you’re more likely to want feedback and mentoring so you can keep learning and growing. So much of this is the core of what life is like in the Defense Department…and I’m not just saying that because I run the place. If you want to try to experience new things, think about a young woman who works with me at the Pentagon, a Navy lieutenant, who’s been to more countries than the number of years she’s been alive. No other job lets you do that. If you want to go to college, without taking on a mountain of debt, the G.I. Bill can give you up to $284,000 for college. At a time when student loans account for over a trillion dollars of debt in America, that’s unbeatable…and it helped three U.S. Presidents, a Supreme Court Justice – as well as your principal and one of your physics teachers – all graduate from college debt-free. If you want responsibility and leadership opportunities, we’re better at that than any other institution on earth. A relatively recent study showed that, while former military officers made up only 3 percent of U.S. adult men, they’re 10 percent of the CEOs of America’s largest corporations – companies like Johnson & Johnson, FedEx and Verizon.  And today, leadership skills are often the number-one reason why companies want to hire veterans. And finally, if you want to make a difference defending your country and making a better world, it’s the highest calling there is out there. So here’s the bottom line: You’re our kind of people – your generation is a great fit for the U.S. military and a great fit for what we do. Because our mission is so important and since our people are that heart of it, we’re exploring new ideas that will make us an even better fit for a generation like yours.  The Pentagon can be a pretty closed, five-sided box. So we need to think outside of it, and we know that. Because if a good idea will help make us better, we’re going to consider it. For example, we know from talking to people your age how much you value merit – the principle that people should be given responsibilities and benefits they deserve. Today the military rank structure still dates back to when Napoleon was invading Europe two hundred years ago. Now there’s some good reasons for that. But certainly specialty jobs, like cyber-security, we need to be looking at ways to bring in more qualified people, even if they’re already in the middle of their career, rather than just starting out. And as college loans get bigger and bigger for people with certain skills, we need to look at ways to help pay off student debts for people who’ve already gone to college. We also have to look at ways to promote people, but not on just when they joined but even more, based on their performance and their talent. And we need to be on the cutting edge of evaluating performance. Your generation’s command of technology is beyond what we’ve ever seen, and we need to take advantage of that kind of data-intensive technology – the kind that you use every day, and that suggests movies and TV shows and so forth on Netflix or who to follow on Twitter or Facebook – and apply them to measure and to chart how a person is doing in all aspects of their job on a day-to-day basis. We also need to use 21st century technologies – like LinkedIn kinds of thing – to help develop 21st century leaders and give our people even more flexibility and choice in deciding their next job…in the military. And while we currently have internships, fellowships, and pilot programs that let people pause their military service for a few years – while they’re getting a degree, learning a new skill, or starting a family – right now these programs are very small.  These programs are good for us and our people because they help people bring new skills and talents from outside back into the military. So we need to look not only at ways we can improve and expand those programs, but also think about completely new ideas to help our people gain new skills and experiences. Finally, knowing how much your generation cares about diversity, drawing talent from a wide range of gender, racial, religious, cultural, economic, educational, and all sorts of other backgrounds – we’re going to keep making sure that anyone who’s able and willing to serve their country has the full and equal opportunity to do so.  Whether you’re a man or woman, gay, lesbian or straight, no matter what walk of life your family comes from. And we’ll make sure you’re treated with dignity and respect. We’re already a leader.  Right now, the Defense Department has a higher share of senior women leaders than America’s most profitable companies do. And we’re going to do even better because that’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. I’m glad your generation has lots of choices in life, and I know you do – especially if you go to Abington – so we’re going to be competing hard for talent like yours around the country…engaging not just in the usual places, but everywhere we can find talented people like yourselves. Now, I know that not everyone here in this room now is thinking about military service – and that’s okay. But if you’re like I was, and you’re still interested in serving your country and making a better world, we need to be ready to help with ways you can serve as a civilian. Right now, that’s not something our local recruiters offer, but we have to re-think that. We want people to consider military and public service because when it comes to working in national security, no matter what you do, military or civilian, you will be better off for having been part of this incredible mission. Whether it’s the people, the skills, or the experiences, nothing else compares. I guarantee it. So let me close by putting all this in perspective. You’ve grown up in an era when plenty of public figures and big institutions have given you good reason to ask tough questions about them, whether it’s gridlock in Congress or controversies surrounding some of our biggest banks, corporations, and sports teams. But there’s also a good reason why in spite of all this most Americans your age – and most of the rest of the country – still hold one institution in high esteem, and that’s our nation’s military. You can look it up...year after year, Gallup polls show our military is the most trusted institution in America. That’s partly because Americans know deep down that our men and women in uniform will always do whatever it takes to keep our country secure. And it’s partly because honor and sacrifice – putting yourself at risk for your fellow Americans – these are timeless values. That’s why people like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver – who all spend a lot of time poking fun at our government and our society – also spend lots of time off-camera supporting those who serve in uniform. Because the military is something special. Now, no institution is above scrutiny – and I’m scrutinizing the Pentagon more than anyone else. But the military and public service as a whole is worthy of your respect…worthy of your support…and worthy of your consideration as a career, not just for the difference it will make in your life, but also the difference it will let you make in the lives of others. One last point. I myself didn’t think much about national security when I was your age. I was focused on physics, history, sports, things like that. That changed a few years later when I heard a speech about the future of technology in the military. It helped me realize that I could make a contribution to defending this country.  As it turned out, that speaker was a man named Bill Perry, who later became my mentor, stood in for my father at my wedding, my friend, and a Secretary of Defense. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a future Secretary of Defense sitting among you today…maybe it’ll be Kayla, or maybe someone else. But I’m also confident that you all have something to contribute: the drive to be part of something bigger than yourself. That’s where the call to service begins. And that’s the beginning of how, together, we’ll make a better and a brighter world.  Thank you.

"Jan. 11, 2017","Good evening everyone. Thanks  for that kind introduction, John, and for the first-ever Nunn Prize.  This is a particular honor for me because I have such respect for both CSIS and for Sam Nunn – more on him in a moment. I’m pleased tonight to get together with so many legends in our foreign policy community, long-time friends of mine, of the Defense Department, and colleagues past and present.  There are just too many of you here –I owe you all too much – to do everyone justice…in particular if we ever want to eat dinner, and I do have something I want to say. I do acknowledge and appreciate Zbig being here, Sam, Carla, Dick Lugar – and more on that in a moment - Michele and so many others…Graham here somewhere?  Thanks each of you for your service to this country, for your support during my time as Secretary of Defense, and for your continued commitment to our servicemembers and their families, which is real. Few people over the past 50 years have made a more lasting and forward-looking contributions to America’s security than Sam Nunn.  As a Senator, Sam was a serious and studious steward of our national defense in the last decades of the Cold War and thereafter.  As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam was a leader in strengthening and reforming the Pentagon, both.  And in the years since, he has been a true statesman, helping guide America’s relationship with the world, particularly on nuclear weapons. Through it all, Sam has demonstrated that he understands that America’s defense is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must ensure its continuity and excellence across the years, across the domains of armed conflict – not just air and land and sea, but space, and cyberspace –across parties, from presidential administration to presidential administration – and in that connection, I’m committed to helping President-elect Trump and his team hit the ground running, and also across our government, and from strategic era to strategic era. That last one is important and is the theme, I think, of what this recognition of Sam Nunn means.  Sam and I worked closely together – a quarter century ago and with his friend and colleague Dick Lugar– to confront the unique challenges of another transition between strategic eras at the end of the Cold War. Now, early in that transition, Sam and Dick – almost alone in the country and the world - foresaw a few important developments.  First, the Soviet Union’s was the first-ever disintegration of a nuclear power. Second, while people had considered accidental nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis, few appreciated that nuclear command-and-control would not, could not be, immune from the disintegration of a society in which such controls were embedded.  And in that new situation, Sam and Dick knew that deterrence alone would not protect us against destruction.  And third, they also appreciated that to prevent that new danger from becoming a threat, the United States would need to work with, and not against, the custodians of the former Soviet arsenal. And after having spent half a century and billions upon billions of dollars bringing the Soviet Union to its knees, we would need to help them, even fund them, to secure the vast nuclear legacy of the USSR. That last idea, as many of us remember, and – as Sam later called it – was a little “wacky.”  It was counter-intuitive, it was innovative, it was controversial at the time.  But it was right. More importantly, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program that was based on that idea worked:  it helped the United States denuclearize Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, safeguard fissile materials, and destroy dangerous nuclear weapons systems. It did so because Sam and Dick knew that at a time of strategic transition, we needed to be willing to take bold steps, consider things that seemed to be counterintuitive, some might even think wacky, ideas, and develop new ways of thinking, operating, and investing to continue to keep the nation safe. That’s an important lesson to remember today, at a time of great change – economic, and political, and military, and social, and technological change – and of greater and fiercer competition even than marked those early post-Cold War years – competition for the lead in technology and human talent, competition for power, and competition of ideas about how the world should be ordered. In this time of time of strategic transition, and against this competitive background, the Department of Defense is making a corresponding transition from an era dominated by over a decade of skillful but all-absorbing counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns, to one where we must contend with a wider range of strategic problems. Across this range, DoD is confronting today no fewer than five immediate, but distinct, and each evolving challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe – something we haven’t had to worry about for the last 25 years, but now we do. We’re also managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re countering terrorism and accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL.  And, all the while, the Defense Department is also preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring that our military is ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. And the question I’ll address in this acknowledgment of Sam tonight is the same as it’s been to me for all the time I’ve been Secretary of Defense:  which is how do we successfully confront these challenges  and prepare for that uncertain future? And the answer, fundamentally, is the same as it was 25 years ago:  it has been necessary –it will be necessary – for DoD to change, to adapt, to innovate…not only to meet today’s challenges, but ensure our defense’s continued excellence well into that uncertain future. So I want to speak tonight about the changes underway to respond today’s challenges – focusing particularly on the military campaign to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, our Strong and Balanced Strategy on Russia, and our rebalance to the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific.  And I’ll also describe the actions underway – and innovations we’re making – to ensure that the defense department has the technology, the operational plans, the organization, and the people to continue to defend our country and make a better world for decades to come. Let me start with ISIL. We’ve reached a critical milestone in our counter-ISIL campaign. As we meet this evening, American forces are engaged, with our coalition and local partners, in an intense effort to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, bringing the great weight and our entire range of capabilities to bear in the enabling of capable and motivated local forces.  The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL’s parent tumor – the primary objective of our military campaign in Iraq and Syria and to destroy both the fact and the idea that there can be an Islamic state based upon this ideology – put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat. Reaching this milestone is a direct result of deliberate actions taken since 2015.  First, and going back to of summer 2015, I’ve consolidated the efforts for Iraq and Syria under a single, unified command – streamlining our command-and-control for the fight against ISIL, which we had not had.  Then, in October 2015, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations that I and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford made to accelerate the campaign against ISIL – introducing every single tool of our military into this fight. And I should tell you by the way, that since then, President Obama has approved every recommendation that the Chairman and I have taken to him for additional forces and capabilities, as we’ve seen and sought to seize opportunities to accelerate the campaign. We then revised our overall Coalition Military Campaign Plan, setting out three objectives: First, as I said, to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  Now that’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient. So the second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world:  in Afghanistan, in Libya, and elsewhere.  And the third objective is to work with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners to help protect our homeland and our people from attack –ultimately DoD’s most important mission. The strategic approach of our military campaign in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere is to leverage all the tools at DoD’s disposal to enable capable, motivated local forces to deal a lasting defeat to ISIL. This strategic approach is necessary because the only way to ensure that once defeated, ISIL stays defeated, is to enable local forces to seize and hold territory rather than attempt to substitute for them. And consistent with this approach, we’ve employed some of the U.S. military’s most extraordinary capabilities, and some of our most specialized personnel – from air power and special operations forces, to train, advise, assist capabilities on the ground, to intelligence, cyber tools, logistics.  These assets and our personnel have been able not only to help directly enable local forces on the ground; they also bring to bear the full weight of American and coalition military might. By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we’ve been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across all domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum.  For example, when our special operators conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders, it creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, more targets, more raids, more air strikes, and more opportunities we can seize to gain even more momentum. As a result of all of this, for over a year now – play by play, accelerant after accelerant, town after town– the campaign has delivered the results we laid out and planned. In Iraq, we’ve been helping the Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga to systematically dislodge ISIL from city after city – Ramadi, Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Makhmur, and Qayyarah, just to name a few.  And our coalition is now doing the same in Mosul – having isolated the city, the Iraqis with our help are on the verge of clearing eastern Mosul, and will then move west to clear the remaining portion of the city, right back at the Tigris. This is a complex mission that’s going to take some time to accomplish, but ISIL’s defenses are beginning to weaken and I am confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered. In Syria, we and our local partners put an end to ISIL’s expansion and then began to systematically roll it back towards Raqqa, an important objective since it is the so-called capital of the so-called caliphate, and a hub for plotters of external attacks.  After helping capable and motivated local Syrian partners defend Kobani, we and the coalition enabled them and other local forces to take Shaddadi, Tishrin Dam, Manbij, Jarabulus, Dabiq.  And now converging on Raqqa. As they successfully complete the isolation phase in the weeks ahead, we’re helping them generate the additional local forces that will be necessary to seize and hold that city in the weeks to follow. In addition to taking back territory, our campaign is yielding results in denying ISIL the finances, the supplies, the freedom of movement, and the command and control it needs to survive.  We’ve systematically targeted ISIL-controlled oil wells, revenue depositories, trucks for smuggling and transporting  – indeed just last month, in one of the largest air strikes of this particular kind to date, we destroyed 168 trucks in one strike one evening. We’ve also deliberately focused on severing the territory ISIL controls in Syria from the territory it controls in Iraq.  Leaders of the terrorist group can no longer travel now between Raqqa and Mosul without the risk of either being hunted down by our Expeditionary Targeting Force or struck from the air.  And since we began accelerating our campaign, we’ve killed the majority of ISIL’s original cadre of senior leaders. While these results in Iraq and Syria are encouraging, we must stay focused on the continued execution of this plan.  The inevitable collapse of ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa will certainly put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  But there will still be much more to do after that to make sure that, once defeated, ISIL stays defeated. The fight against ISIL will continue in Iraq and Syria.  In addition, the United States and the coalition will need to continue to counter foreign fighters trying to escape and ISIL’s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself, if they survive alive from Mosul or Raqqa. And, of course, ISIL’s lasting defeat will require the international community and the United States to stay engaged.  In Iraq, we need to carry on our work to train, equip, and enable Iraqi Security Forces, including the Iraqi Army, police, border guards, counterterrorism forces, and other forces under the control of the Iraqi government to liberate the remainder of Iraq, secure it and hold the areas cleared from ISIL even as we continue to support an inclusive and multi-sectarian, de-centralized Iraq. And because, beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore, the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts cannot be allowed to lag too far behind the military campaign.  This at my judgement at this point in the campaign is my biggest concern. As I said earlier, success in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient for dealing ISIL a lasting defeat.  And that’s why we’re also focused on the other two critical objectives of our campaign, which are combatting ISIL’s metastases around the world, and helping to protect the homeland. When it comes to combatting the metastases, we’ve taken correspondingly strong actions in support of capable and motivated forces in Libya, Afghanistan and elsewhere.  For example, alongside our Afghan partners, we recently commenced the third offensive against ISIL in Eastern Afghanistan.  In previous two operations, we and our Afghan partners killed ISIL’s top leader in the country and we also significantly degraded its capabilities and its ability to try to take root there. Of course, destroying the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and defeating its metastases must also help us meet our campaign’s third objective, which is to protect the homeland. On that third objective, DoD is also working, as I said with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners both at home and abroad.  For example, we’ve worked with the FBI to systematically eliminate members of an ISIL cell in Iraq and Syria that was inspiring attacks against our country, including against our armed forces.  And we are continuing to prioritize ISIL’s external operations. The campaign against ISIL and its results are another example of our military’s continued excellence and America’s continued leadership in the Middle East and in the world. No other nation could have brought to bear the combination of resources we have, or assembled the coalition we’ve built, and led the execution of a comprehensive campaign as the United States has done. No other nation could’ve done that.  We did so in pursuit of our nation’s interests – which in this case are aligned with many allies and partners who are also resolved to destroy ISIL; and we did so despite major, simultaneous, and growing military commitments in Europe and Asia, at the same time.  And let me turn to them next. First, I want to discuss Europe, where the Transatlantic Community is standing up to Russia’s provocations and aggression. That’s a big change for many of us – Sam, me, and many other former Cold Warriors – who worked productively with Russia in the post-Cold War era.  In the 1990s our two nations worked together – through the Nunn-Lugar program, and again on Kosovo, and I remember these and participated in both of them personally – with common, rather than cross, purposes. Today, unfortunately, Russia’s aggression and provocation appears to be driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced resentment. We see that in Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Georgia, in its counter-productive role in the ongoing tragedy in Syria, its attacks in cyberspace, its hybrid warfare, its violation of arms-control treaties and other international agreements, and its nuclear saber-rattling. These actions are not what the world expects of a responsible state in the 21st century; rather, each threatens to undermine global security and erode the principled international order that has been so good not only to America, but also to Russia and the rest of the world. Let me be clear, the United States does not, should not, seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don’t seek an enemy in Russia.  But we are also defending our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us.  And we’ll counter attempts to undermine our collective security. To do so, the United States is following a Strong and Balanced Strategy.  In it, we’re addressing Russia’s actions and deterring its aggression while pursuing and preserving bilateral cooperation where U.S. and Russian objectives can be aligned.  This strategy does not simply recycle the twentieth-century playbook used to deter Soviet aggression during the Cold War, because that playbook would not meet the Russian challenge or match the Russian challenge of today. We haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on the Transatlantic Community’s eastern flank for over 20 years.  And unfortunately, as I said, now we do.  That’s why the United States is strengthening our military posture and presence in Europe to be more agile and quicker in responding to the threats that Russia might pose. Our last defense budget request included significantly more funding for our European Reassurance Initiative, now renamed the European Deterrence Initiative – more than quadruple what we allocated the year before. That’s intended to allow us – in addition to the two brigades we already have stationed in Europe – to rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team into Europe on a persistent basis starting later this month.  In fact, over the past few days, the equipment we’re deploying to support that Brigade Combat team has arrived in Germany and is on the rails as we speak.  ERI in 2017 will also enable us to pre-position a brigade’s-worth of equipment and warfighting gear to be used by American forces flown into Europe, these among many other steps. We’re also increasing military exercises with allies and partners to demonstrate resolve and build to their resilience, while enhancing inter-operability with them. We’re updating and refining our contingency and operational plans, including ways to overcome emerging threats such as hybrid warfare and anti-access, area-denial systems.  We’re investing in the technologies most relevant to countering Russia.  And we’re also recapitalizing our nuclear deterrent, because nuclear deterrence is not only the bedrock of our security, but also critical to sustain in light of Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. The United States is not alone in any of this, of course.  For more than 67 years, NATO has been the quintessential example of nations coming together to respond to collective security challenges.  And as it did during the Cold War, NATO will be critical to preserving collective defense in the face of new and renewed threats. To ensure it does so, NATO, too, is adapting to use a new playbook – one that prepares to counter cyber threats and hybrid warfare, to better integrate our conventional and nuclear deterrence, and much, much more. That’s why NATO created a Very-High-Readiness Joint Task Force that can deploy allied forces on 48 [hours’] notices to any crisis on allied territory.  That’s why NATO is also deploying four battalions to its eastern flank – one each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the latter by the way is where the United States will lead a battalion starting in April this year.  And it’s why NATO is providing support to partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia to help strengthen and reform their national defense institutions and to improve their ability to work with NATO. Everything the United States is doing, both on its own and with NATO, will ensure that we continue to stand up to Russian aggression, and that we’re ready for longer-term competition. But it’s also necessary to keep the door open to working with Russia, when and where our interests align, or can be made to align.  And as I said, there was a time, in the years after the Cold War, when Russia cooperated with the United States and other nations, contributing to the principled international order rather than undermining it.  I remember that personally – and so do many of you.  And perhaps someday, we’ll see that spirit rekindled. Next, I want to discuss what the defense department has to do to carry out the security aspect of President Obama’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.  The rebalance has ensured that DoD will continue to help provide the security necessary for that consequential region – home to nearly half the global population and nearly half the global economy – and allow it to remain a place where everyone can rise and prosper. That’s been American policy and practice since the end of World War II.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace else – the United States has remained economically, politically, and militarily engaged in the Asia-Pacific. Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability there has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO in Europe.  That’s made sense because of the Asia-Pacific’s unique history, geography, and politics. Instead, the United States has long taken a principled and inclusive approach, and collaborated with a network of regional allies and partners to enable security and uphold important principles like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. Because we did so, out of the rubble of World War II, economic miracle after miracle occurred.  Think about it…first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, and now, today, China, India, and others rose and prospered. That progress has produced incredible changes in the region:  populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have spread, economies have grown more interconnected, and military spending and cooperation are both increasing. Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s interests and objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured:  we still want peace, stability, and progress there for all, including ourselves.  But as the region has changed, our approach to how we advance our interests and uphold those enduring principles has had to change along with it. Today, as the Defense Department has been operationalizing one phase after another of the military part of the rebalance, we’re not only ensuring we remain the strongest military and primary provider of regional security; we’re also connecting – and further networking – our allies and partners in a burgeoning Principled and Inclusive Security Network that will allow all of us to see more, share more, and do more to maintain security in the region. In the rebalance’s first phase, DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region, committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets to the Asia-Pacific, and began to modernize our regional posture around Guam as a strategic hub. In the second phase, which we launched almost two years ago, we committed to sending some of our best people and our most advanced capabilities to the region – our newest submarines, aircraft, and surface warfare vessels, for example – even as we developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts for the principal contingencies that could occur there. We also significantly strengthened our bilateral alliances and partnerships.  Nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice, we’ve now strengthened these relationships so they better reflect 21st century security needs.  There are many examples to point to in the region – whether it’s our long-time alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia, or our newer growing partnerships with India, Singapore, Vietnam and others. Now, in the third phase, it will be necessary to cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second, and more importantly, build upon it. It will be necessary for the United States to continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region, and the security partner of choice, by increasing and targeting investments in capabilities suited to the region to ensure we stay the best there. We’ll also continue to make “leap-ahead” technological investments – including some surprising ones – that will help us keep the lead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere. And we’ll further catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing Principled and Inclusive Security Network.  Although it’s not a formal alliance like NATO, this burgeoning network – built on trilateral and multilateral as well as bilateral relationships – is grounded in those principles I mentioned earlier.  It’s inclusive, since any nation and any military   can contribute – that’s the American approach. That’s all to the good for the region and the United States, but it’s important to remember, the rebalance and this Asia-Pacific security network are not aimed at any particular country.  The network’s not closed and excludes no one.  Although we have disagreements with China, including over its destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea – and its behavior is in fact driving many more to work more closely with us – we’re committed to working with China where possible, to introducing measures to reduce risk, and to encouraging China to avoid self-isolation. All this is happening today.  But even as we confront the challenges of this time of strategic transition, it will also be necessary for DoD to lead and compete well into the future. Today ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or more innovative.  But that’s not a birthright, it’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted.  We need to earn it again and again. To do so, we have to invest and innovate for the uncertain future we face, as well as deal with the problems of today.  And that’s why I’ve been consistently pushing the Pentagon to think, as I put it, outside of our five-sided-box to ensure that our technology, our plans, our organization, and above all, our people stay the best for decades to come. We’ve made the decisions and investments to ensure DoD maintains our dominance in every domain, not just sea and air and land, but also in space, and cyberspace. We’re pushing the envelope with research and development despite the budget woes to stay ahead of our competitors and at technology’s frontier, by putting for example nearly $72 billion dollars into R&D alone this next year.  To give you a little context, that’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D combined in 2015. Beyond that, we’ve been building and rebuilding bridges between the Pentagon and America’s technology community. One way we’re doing that is through our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – which I created to help connect with startups and other commercial tech firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and everywhere in between.  Those outposts are already producing results:  DIUx has interacted with companies in over 30 states to help us adopt technologies more quickly that can help our warfighters accomplish their missions.  We always will continue to need our excellent existing and traditional defense partners that help us build our amazing defense systems, but DIUx will also help better connect the Pentagon as a whole to the entire world of American innovation.  That’s an investment worth making.  Because when I started my life in science and technology and national security most technology of consequence came from the United States, and most of that from government sponsorship.   We’re still an influential force, but it’s not just us in the Defense Department anymore.  To stay the best, we need to interact with the rest of the technological ecosystem. We’re also innovating operationally in our operations plans.  Our core contingency plans are constantly being changed to apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as anti-satellite weapons or hybrid warfare.  We’re building in modularity, planning in new ways for overlapping contingencies, and injecting agility and flexibility into our war plans. Meanwhile we’re making reforms across the DoD enterprise – streamlining our headquarters operations, lowering our health care costs, continuing to improve our acquisition process, and more.  We’re also continuing to support and seek improvements in the spirit of Goldwater-Nichols – which Sam Nunn had so much to do with – among other changes, to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, and the Joint Staff, and to help our Combatant Commanders be more efficient and agile and support me and the President, especially in the face of transregional and transfunctional challenges. And we’re ensuring DoD’s a place where thinking boldly and differently is fostered.  One way we’re doing so is with the Defense Innovation Board I established last year, chaired by Google-Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt.  Its members are already making a mark.  For example, on their recommendation, we have now a Chief Innovation Officer, which many companies have by the way, to act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense. And lastly, and importantly Sam alluded to this, we’re building what I call the Force of the Future…to ensure that amid generational, technological, and labor market changes, we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer, for what is after all an all-volunteer force. In total, the Force of the Future initiatives span the career of a uniformed servicemember or DoD civilian – from recruiting men and women to join, to caring for, retaining, and developing them, and then to helping successfully transition those who want to move on. And these initiatives include reinvigorating and expanding the geographic reach of our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, which by the way just had its 100th birthday this year; making common-sense improvements to military talent management and officer promotion; giving components the authority to directly hire civilians on college campuses – this is a big deal if you remember your mind-set in college; recognizing survey data indicating the importance of family life to retention –  bearing in mind that our force is largely a married force – by expanding maternity and paternity leave and extending on-base childcare hours, and other steps of this kind. And also, ensuring that DoD must be able to draw from 100 percent of the American population…and to compete for the best we must select the best based solely upon their qualifications to meet our high standards – not race, not gender, identity, sexual orientation – but rather, focusing on whether someone can meet our standards as the best person for the job. In conclusion, because we’re doing all this, because DoD’s changing, and adapting, and innovating, because of our nation’s enduring strengths, I’m confident that its future is bright and that there are many opportunities for our country to seize. But I can never forget – and we can never forget – and I’m even more mindful as my days as Secretary of Defense grows short, about who makes it all happen: it’s DoD’s people. Each of our servicemembers and DoD civilians makes me proud, incredibly proud.  There are almost 3 million of them serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain – in the air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace – all in service of this great nation. All of them are defending not only the United States and its people; they’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while they provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life. Because they do so, we can gather here this evening in safety and celebrate Sam Nunn.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at one of America’s world-class universities.  We can live our lives and dream our dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought. They make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want them all to know– I ask you to take a moment to reflect yourselves – that we don’t take them for granted.  Stephanie, my wife, and I begin every day with them. As all of you know, our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day and what they’ve done for us.  Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service is invaluable.  And their sacrifices will never be forgotten.  So, on that note let me just say, may God bless them, God bless our great country. Sam, I’m honored to be here this evening. Thank you for this honor.  Let’s enjoy this evening.

"Jan. 14, 2016","Ladies and gentlemen, excellencies, Congressman Hunter, members of the SOUTHCOM team, the entire team, friends and family, it’s a privilege to be here as we honor these two great Americans and their families. And to all of the men and women of SOUTHCOM and all of the men and women who serve this great nation, thank you for the critical work you do everywhere. Now, here at SOUTHCOM, we count on you to be there when it matters most, responding to natural disasters, preparing for contingencies, confronting criminal networks and disrupting their trade in drugs and human lives.  You work with partner nations to promote the rule of law and democratic principles, and help to strengthen professional, accountable militaries that respect human rights. In short, the men and women of SOUTHCOM continue to provide the people of the United States and our neighbors a chance to live in peace, to dream their dreams, to live full lives.  And even as SOUTHCOM has been challenged to achieve more with less, never have the men and women of this command performed with greater excellence. Their accomplishments have come under the exceptional leadership of my friend General John Kelly over the last three years.  John has spent more than four decades of dedicated, principled, honored and skilled service as a United States Marine.  More than four decades of supporting peace and freedom for countless men and women he will never know, and may never meet.  More than four decades of building a legacy of leadership and integrity among the men and women under his command. By the way, I’m about to say much about John Kelly. It’s from personal knowledge – working beside him, with him – sometimes it seemed for him, when he was Senior Military Advisor to the Secretary of Defense. Across our military, John is famous for his ability to relate to troops and civilians alike, drawing from the depth and breadth of his own experience.  He can captivate an audience in the best traditions of the Boston Irish; in an instant, he can tailor his stories, many of which are actually true, to suit someone’s personality or stage in life. Most importantly, he has always taken the time to understand what matters most: our people.  He takes the time to appreciate what matters to them; what they aspire to achieve, and what unique contribution he can make in their lives as a leader.  That’s part of why people trust John, why they are so loyal to John … why they want to be led by John. Certainly, General Kelly’s path to service was out of the ordinary, but then again, so was his extraordinary career.  John came of age during a turbulent time of change and transformation.  And it would be hard to find another recruit to our military who had seen so much of the world before he served; who traveled the Pacific for two years as a merchant marine; who hitchhiked from Boston to Washington State, but found it more interesting to travel industrial rail lines to find his way back home. Wherever he has traveled, from the streets of Brighton, and yes, even through Haight-Ashbury in its hey-day, General Kelly has been comfortable in the world and confident in his convictions.  His commitment to service and duty, courage and country, have always been at his core. So when John’s mother called in 1970, letting him know that his draft number was about to come up, he decided he would serve in the best way he knew how:  He joined the Marines.  And there are two leaders with us today, General Kelly and General Dunford, who might tell you this was the only way to serve for any self-respecting Irish-Catholic from Boston. John completed his two year enlistment as a Sergeant, which was no small feat.  It was a time where he learned the awesome responsibility of leadership, lessons that remained with him through three combat tours in Iraq, and multiple command assignments across the world.  He learned what it means to ask young people to enter extreme danger to accomplish the mission.  And he learned that behind every Marine there is a family serving alongside them – spouses, children, parents, siblings. Watching. Waiting. Semper Fidelis. John, you and Karen know what it means to watch and wait.  And for so many other families, your strength, experience, and counsel are an inspiration. Few can describe service and sacrifice more eloquently and passionately than John.  Few have a deeper appreciation for the magnificence of the young people who step forward to serve our country.  John, as you once said about those under your command: “These were good and decent young men and women who every day, performed remarkable and most often unsung acts of bravery and selflessness to a cause they decided was bigger and more important than themselves.” Throughout your career, you have recognized that cause, lived for that cause, fought for that cause.  You have conducted yourself as a Marine.  Our force, and our nation, is far stronger because of you, your family, and your legacy.  John, on behalf of the Department of Defense, thank you. John, as you transition from this command, you do so with a knowledge that the men and women of SOUTHCOM are in the good hands of another principled leader from another remarkable family: Admiral Kurt Tidd. The Admiral Tidd who becomes SOUTHCOM Commander today is in fact the third Admiral Tidd in the United States’ Navy’s history.  In fact, Kurt has said the sights, smells, and sounds aboard his father’s destroyer are his first memories as a child.  From the moment Kurt first saw Midshipmen marching in formation across the Academy grounds, he knew where he wanted to go.  He knew who he wanted to be. Certainly, his father’s record of service left an indelible imprint on our country and most of all, on two sons who became Admirals too. Admiral Tidd may have one of the most distinguished pedigrees in our Navy, but I have seen firsthand that he is never afraid to roll up his sleeves and get grease under his nails.  Then-Secretary Gates was convinced, as was I as his acquisition chief at the time, which was some years ago now, that the Pentagon bureaucracy was not responsive enough, nor rapid enough, in equipping our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with capabilities like MRAPs and ISR. And he and Chairman Mullen gave me and Kurt the job of making sure the Pentagon was at war and not just the troops. So in those days, Admiral Tidd and I travelled together to lots of austere forward operating bases and combat outposts, assessing the urgent needs and managing their fulfillment. Hot meals, and even beds, were few in those days. Kurt reveled in it. He enjoyed it so much that I often wondered whether he missed his calling as a Marine. But he was effective: his work saved lives and ensured mission success. In fact, Kurt is the classic case of someone who can, as the poem goes, “walk with Kings but never lose the common touch.”  This combination of qualities made him such an effective advisor over the past two years, supporting the Secretary of State as Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on diplomatic visits across the world.  Across 600,000 miles and through dozens of arduous negotiations Admiral Tidd served as an indispensable link between American defense and diplomacy. From his earlier service in the Gulf and leadership in naval combat operations, Kurt also understands the language of coalition operations.  He clearly appreciates the conversation between countries, cultures, and peoples that SOUTHCOM has cultivated for much of the last century. These insights will remain vital as we work with Latin American and Caribbean partners at this critical juncture in our hemisphere’s history -- a moment filled with opportunity. Today, the area of SOUTHCOM’s responsibility is a zone of peace and rising prosperity.  Nations from Colombia, to Chile, to Brazil are global exporters of security.  Colombia, in particular, holds special promise.  Thanks to the sacrifices of the Colombian people, Colombia now stands on the brink of a historic peace.  And as they did during their most difficult times, the people of SOUTHCOM will continue to stand with our Colombian friends as they reach for days of even greater possibility. So we take great confidence in this hemisphere’s future, even as we remain focused on what further progress requires.  We simply cannot tolerate the activities of criminal organizations who poison so many communities across the Americas.  Whether they traffic in narcotics, human lives, or extremist ideology, these criminal networks are threats to us all.  As General Kelly’s determined efforts with our partners made clear, these groups should find no shelter in this hemisphere.  I know Admiral Tidd shares this steadfast commitment and he will carry it forward with characteristic excellence and resolve. Both General Kelly and Admiral Tidd understand America’s unique ability to galvanize and lead global coalitions.  They understand the attractive power of the values that America and so many around the world share together, and they have dedicated their lives to ensuring the power of our example grows stronger. Admiral Tidd is now called upon to do so once again, pursuing many efforts, including our efforts to bring the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to a responsible close. I believe, along with the President, that doing so would benefit our national security and have so stated since I took office. But not everyone in GTMO can be safely transferred to another country, so we need an alternative. I have therefore framed for the President a proposal to establish an alternative location. That plan will propose bringing those detainees to an appropriate, secure location in the United States. Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal. While we work with Congress on a way forward, we will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when and as we have mitigated any security risk to the United States. Just last night, after a deliberate and careful review, we completed the transfer of 10 Yemenis – roughly ten percent of the total remaining Gitmo population – to the government of Oman. That brings the population to 93. Like every transfer that came before it, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government.  As we work diligently to close this chapter in our history, we will continue to – and I believe in this strongly, strongly – to value and support the professionalism and the dignity of the men and women of SOUTHCOM who carry out what is an exceedingly difficult mission. Today, as we mark this change of command at SOUTHCOM, between two distinguished Naval officers, between two proven statesman, and two coalition-builders, we also celebrate a remarkable continuity.  Both General Kelly and Admiral Tidd are a perfect fit for SOUTHCOM, a command where our partners matter so much and partnerships run so deep. In this hemisphere and beyond, none of us knows when a crisis may arise.  We cannot predict where the magnificent men and women of SOUTHCOM will be called to save lives, defend our nation, or respond with our partners.  But we do know this:  We know Admiral Tidd will lead this team with certainty, clarity, and with the total confidence of me and the President. We know the force he inherits is ready for the future thanks to the determined efforts of General Kelly.  And we know that SOUTHCOM will continue to strengthen our bonds across the Americas, as together, we shape a shared future, one that is both more prosperous and more secure for all our citizens.

"Nov. 14, 2014","Good morning. Earlier this year, following revelations about troubling lapses and poor morale in our nation's nuclear forces, I ordered comprehensive internal and external reviews of our entire nuclear enterprise, spanning the Air Force's ground- and air-based nuclear deterrent as well as the Navy's submarine-based systems. I tasked both teams to examine the health of the nuclear enterprise, focusing on personnel training, testing, command oversight, mission performance, and funding.  This morning with me here on the stage are individuals who have played a particularly important role in these reviews.  But probably most importantly, they have the responsibility to carry out the recommendations that came from these reviews.  And I believe you know that after I leave this morning, the Deputy Secretary, Bob Work, and others here will stay on the stage and answer more specific questions.

	But I want to thank Secretary Work.

	Admiral, thank you very, very much for what you have done as Vice Chief of Naval Operations, because your component is critical to this.

	Admiral Haney, thank you for your continued leadership at STRATCOM.  Your component also is an integral element of our strategic forces. Our Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary James, who will be leaving with me right after this news conference, and we'll go to Minot Air Force Base in Minot, North Dakota, and spend the day, for your continued leadership, General Wilson, thank you for what you do with your forces and your team.

	These individuals, as well as other leaders, have all been integral, as I said, to what we are doing and the internal review part of this.

	Our internal and external reviewers visited all of our domestic operational nuclear bases and many of their key support facilities. They interviewed hundreds of personnel, officers, enlisted, civilians, and contractors.

	The review team leaders from the external review part of this are with us this morning. And I want to particularly thank Admiral Harvey and General Larry Welch, Admiral Fanta, and Madelyn Creedon for your leadership.

	Madelyn headed up the internal review and General Welch and Admiral Haney headed up the external review.

	The work that they put into this, the dedication, literally hundreds of hours, was pretty spectacular. And to all of you and your teams and those who supported you, we are grateful. Thank you.

	Today, I'm announcing:  First, I want to be clear about the importance of the Defense Department's nuclear mission and its role in defending our nation.

	Our nuclear deterrent plays a critical role in ensuring U.S. national security, and it's DOD's highest priority mission.  No other capability we have is more important.  Our nuclear triad deters nuclear attack on the United States and our allies and our partners.  It prevents potential adversaries from trying to escalate their way out of failed conventional aggression.  And it provides the means for effective response should deterrence fail.

	Consistent with President Obama's guidance, our policy is to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our nation's security strategy and to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. We'll continue to do both, but that doesn't diminish our responsibilities.  As the President has made clear, as long as we have nuclear weapons, we will - and we must - ensure that they are safe, secure, and effective.

	DOD's senior leaders and I are in full agreement.  We're in full agreement that, today, America's nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective.  That is thanks to the heroic efforts of the airmen, sailors and Marine who, despite sometimes insufficient resources and manpower, stretch themselves to maintain and guard and protect and operate the nuclear enterprise every day.

	However, the internal and external reviews I ordered show that a consistent lack of investment and support for our nuclear forces - over far too many years - has left us with too little margin to cope with mounting stresses.  The reviews found evidence of systematic problems that, if not addressed, could undermine the safety, security, and effectiveness of the elements of the force in the future. These problems include manning, infrastructure, and skill deficiencies; a culture of micro-management and over-inspection; and inadequate communication, follow- up, and accountability by senior department in nuclear enterprise leadership.

	The root cause has been a lack of sustained focus, attention, and resources, resulting in a pervasive sense that a career in the nuclear enterprise offers too few opportunities for growth and advancement.  I know this from my many conversations with personnel in our nuclear force. For the past several months, DOD has been taking action to resolve the key problems and implement more than 100 recommendations from the internal and external reviews.  Some of these recommendations involve changes in organization, policies, and culture.  Others require an increase in resources, allocated to the nuclear mission.  We must address all of the underlying problems.

	Let me begin with the many steps we've already taken, starting with improving oversight. First, I established a Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group, which brings together the entire senior leadership of DOD's nuclear enterprise - not only from here at the Pentagon, but also from Strategic Command in Nebraska, and Air Force Global Strike Command in Louisiana. Previous reviews of our nuclear enterprise lacked clear follow-up mechanisms.  Recommendations were implemented without the necessary follow-through to assess that they were implemented effectively.  There was a lack of accountability.

	To fix that, I've directed our analysts in DOD's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation to track both the status of the actions we're taking, the progress we're making, and the impact on the health of our nuclear force.  We will need to know what's working and what's not.   Each month they will report their findings to Deputy Secretary Work - who I've asked to help lead this effort - as well as the other members of the review group, who will all report to me approximately every 90 days.

	I will hold our leaders accountable - up and down the chain of command - to ensure that words are matched with actions. We must change the cultural perception of our nuclear enterprise, which has particularly suffered in the Air Force.  We must restore the prestige that attracted the brightest minds of the Cold War era, so our most talented young men and women see the nuclear pathway as promising and valued.  That's why I have granted the Air Force authority to elevate Global Strike Command to a four-star billet and Air Staff's head of Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration to a three-star billet.  They will no longer be outranked by their non-nuclear counterparts, giving the nuclear Air Force the second-to-none leadership it deserves. And last week, Secretary James, who has been a tremendous leader on this issue, personally awarded the first 25 Nuclear Deterrence Operations Service Medals, a new medal created to recognize the critical contributions that our nuclear force airmen make to America's security.  Cultural change must permeate down through the individual with every airman in our nuclear enterprise - knowing how much we value them and their service. We already are starting to match much needed leadership and oversight with much needed investments. Earlier this year, the Air Force established a force improvement program for Global Strike Command and reallocated over $160 million in Fiscal Year 2014 and $150 million in Fiscal Year 2015 to address the most urgent shortfalls in equipment, facilities and manning.

	Some of this will fund incentive pay for critical nuclear assignments, helping retain our best airmen and keeping our focus on what matters most - our people.  The Air Force has exempted 4,000 airmen from manpower reductions, while adding over 1,100 billets to forces under Global Strike Command to fill gaps in operations, maintenance, security and other critical areas.

	Our efforts must be sustained over the long term, which is why we are in the process of doing much more. DOD will soon finish updating and standardizing how we conduct inspections and elevate our personnel across the nuclear enterprise, eliminating micro-management, redundancies, and administrative burdens that overtax the force and ultimately harm the mission.

	The Navy is reducing administrative distractions and is planning to both hire more than 2,500 workers and overhaul aging infrastructure at public shipyards, strategic weapons facilities, and reactor training systems.  Meanwhile, the Air Force is planning construction to improve weapons storage facilities; will replace helicopters for its ballistic missile security forces; and is in the midst of revamping how it trains, evaluates, and manages the nuclear force.

	Both services are elevating - and reinforcing - the nuclear mission, including in the budget request they're preparing for Fiscal Year 2016. We will need to make billions of dollars of additional investments in the nuclear enterprise over the next five years.  This new funding, which will be detailed in our budget submission next year, will be critical to continue improving upkeep and security, while addressing shortfalls that undermine morale of the nuclear force.

	There is much more we need to do leading up to our nuclear modernization program in the next decade. Over the last year, I've traveled to see missileers at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and called launch control officers underground at Malstrom Air Force Base in Montana.  I visited nuclear weapons maintainers at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, and met with STRATCOM senior and junior officers at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, and met with sailors in the ballistic missile submarine U.S.S Tennessee at Kings Bay, Georgia.  And right after this press conference, as I noted, Secretary of the Air Force James and I will leave for Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, to speak with missileers, bomber crews, and support teams that are now stationed there.

	My message to them today and to their colleagues across the military is simple: Our nuclear enterprise is foundational to America's national security.  And the resources and attention we commit to the nuclear force must reflect that.  We need our best people in this enterprise.

	I will now take a couple of questions before Secretary James and I leave. And, as I said, this team will stay behind and answer further questions that you may have.

"April 27, 2016","I. PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY Chairman Cochran, Vice Chairman Durbin, Members of the Committee:  Thank you for inviting me here today, and for your steadfast support for the men and women of the Department of Defense (DoD), military and civilian alike, who serve and defend our country all over the world.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget submission for the Defense Department. At this time last year, we were all facing the bleak prospect of looming budget sequestration, and the damage its return would do to our people and our mission.  I’m grateful that our country’s leaders were able to come together last fall to avert that dismal future, and reach a budget deal that – after several years of fiscal turmoil and reductions – has allowed for greater investment in all our elements of national security and strength.  That was what I urged since becoming Secretary of Defense, including in last year’s budget testimony before this committee, and given the threat environment we face around the world, forging that deal was the responsible thing to do.  It allows our military personnel and their families to know their future more than just one year at a time, which they deserve.  It lets our defense industry partners be more efficient and cutting edge, as we need them to be.  And, perhaps most importantly, it sends a signal to the world – to friends and potential foes alike – of our nation’s strength and resolve. The President’s budget submission accordingly adheres to that budget deal – requesting a total of $582.7 billion for the Defense Department in FY 2017, for both the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds combined.  How we plan to invest those funds, along with our planned investments for the next five years – as detailed in the customary Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that’s included in the President’s budget submission – are critical to DoD’s ability to carry out our mission of national defense with the excellence the American people expect of their military, which is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. As you know, no one got everything they wanted in the budget deal – I said last year that we needed to rise above our differences, and I’m glad many members of Congress were able to do that – so in budgeting and programming for FY 2017, we had to make responsible choices.  The President’s budget submission reflects those choices, and we need your support for them.  This is particularly true for prudent and necessary reforms – some of which the Congress has long denied, in spite of the cost to both DoD and to America’s taxpayers.  Indeed, while DoD is grateful to this and the other defense committees for your support for the budget deal, it is also the defense committees that in recent years have been tying our hands on reform, as I will address later in this testimony. We should remember, however, that the budget deal only covered two years.  Unless Congress addresses the years beyond it and heads off sequestration, DoD will face $100 billion in cuts from 2018 to 2021, which would introduce unacceptable risks.  So Washington will need to come together once again – not unlike last year, and two years before that – to provide stability and protect our national security. That’s important, because in this budget submission, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we must fight and win today’s fights, we must also be prepared to deter and if necessary fight and win the fights that might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on changing its shape in fundamental ways – making choices and tradeoffs to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future.  II. A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT Let me now describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe, as we have been since the end of World War II.  As we fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era. Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused on large-scale counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DoD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full-spectrum warfighting.  While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it’s also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL, and the resurgence of Russia, being just the most prominent examples. This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we’ve seen in history following major wars.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different – and more diverse and complex in the scope of its challenges – than the one we’ve been engaged with for the last 25 years, and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. Accordingly, five evolving challenges are now driving the focus of DoD’s planning and budgeting. Two of these challenges reflect a recognition of – return to, in some ways – great power competition.  This is something we haven’t seen for some time, and that requires heightened focus given its potential impact on our nation and the world.  The first such challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  The second is in the Asia-Pacific, where we haven’t faced great power competition since the end of World War II, and where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  One is North Korea, which remains dangerous to both us and our allies – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran – because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and doesn’t limit DoD in any way, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Challenge number five, no less important than the other four, is our ongoing fight to counter terrorism, and especially defeat ISIL – most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also where it is metastasizing, in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere – at the same time as we’re protecting our homeland.  While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective and in our budgeting we must also take into account that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, countering terrorists will be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of DoD and other national security leaders. DoD must and will address all five of these challenges as part of its mission to defend this country.  Doing so requires some new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities. Key to our approach is being able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  This means we must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action, or make them deeply regret it if they do.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we are able to win, on our terms.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict. We have this ability with respect to North Korean and Iranian military forces, as well as in executing the military aspects of countering terrorists, as we’re doing now against ISIL.  That won’t change, even as we know that military power alone cannot prevail without capable and motivated local forces to sustain ISIL’s defeat – nor can the United States alone deliver a lasting defeat – against the toxic ideology of terrorists like ISIL that have so little regard for the lives of fellow human beings. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and are continuing to advance military systems that threaten our advantages in specific areas, and in some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives in ways they hope would preempt a response by the United States.  Because of these facts, because the implications of any great-power conflict would be so dire for the United States and the world, and because of those nations’ actions to date – from Ukraine to the South China Sea – DoD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting to ensure we maintain our advantages in the future. While we do not desire conflict with any of these nations – and, to be clear, though they pose some similar defense challenges, they are very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they choose to pursue.  That is the responsible course of action for the Defense Department.  Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and even as we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them, which is itself a key part of deterrence. Our military must be balanced with the proper size and capability to defeat any attack against U.S. forces and our allies.  And because of the decisions in this budget, our military will be better prepared for both present and future challenges, and better positioned to deter, and if necessary fight and win, wars against even the most high-end of potential adversaries. As this budget addresses those five evolving challenges, it also seizes great opportunities – in supporting new and innovative operational concepts; in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, including undersea, cyber, space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities; in reforming the defense enterprise; and in building the force of the future.  I will address the investments we’re making to do so later in this testimony.  III. SUPPORTING THE STRENGTH AND WELLNESS OF TODAY’S FIGHTING FORCE Before I address how this budget ensures we meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, I want to first emphasize our enduring commitment to supporting the men, women, and families of the world’s finest fighting force.  Above all, this means exercising the utmost care in decisions involving the deployment and employment of our troops.  It also requires devoting a significant share of our budget every year toward supporting the people, military and civilian alike, who execute DoD’s missions around the world. To ensure we have a force that’s ready to carry out today’s missions, this budget invests in the four main things that every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine needs to do their job – the right training; the right equipment; the right force size, meaning the right number of people alongside them; and the right compensation. The Right Training In FY 2017 and beyond, the budget makes critical investments in training throughout the force to rebuild toward full-spectrum combat readiness and continue recovering from the damage caused by sequestration in recent years – though, it’s important to remember that restoring readiness requires not only sufficient funding, but also time.  The budget maximizes use of the Army’s decisive action Combat Training Centers, funding 19 total Army brigade-level training rotations.  It provides robust funding to sustain the Navy and Marine Corps’ current training levels and readiness recovery plans for FY 2017 – optimizing Navy training while maximizing the availability of naval forces for global operations, and fully funding the Marine Corps’ integrated combined arms exercises for all elements of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  And, because recent operational demands like the fight against ISIL have slowed the Air Force’s return to full-spectrum readiness, the budget increases funding – as part of a $1 billion increase over the FYDP to support Air Force readiness – to modernize and expand existing Air Force training ranges and exercises here at home, providing pilots and airmen with more realistic training opportunities when they’re not deployed. The Right Equipment The budget also makes important investments to provide our men and women in uniform with functioning, well-maintained equipment so that when we send them into the fights of today, they’re able to accomplish their mission and come home safely.  For example, to address the Navy and Marine Corps’ growing maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F-18 depot maintenance capacity, and it buys an additional 16 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and FY 2018 – providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps’ 4th-generation fighter aircraft fleet so it’s ready and capable for today’s missions.  To help ensure the Air Force has enough ready and capable aircraft for both combat missions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), the budget funds improvements in the avionics and electronic warfare systems of legacy fighter and bomber aircraft, and it supports the Air Force’s ‘get well plan’ for remotely-piloted aircraft. The budget also makes critical investments in every domain to research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and equipment our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  I will detail those investments later in this testimony. The Right Force Size The flexibility provided by last fall’s budget deal allowed us to maintain DoD’s desired targets across the FYDP for end-strength and active-reserve mix for our ground forces – without it, sequestration likely would have forced further reductions.  Therefore, the budget stabilizes our total ground force end-strength by the end of FY 2018 with an Army of 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 56 total Army brigade combat teams and associated enablers – and a Marine Corps of 182,000 active-duty Marines and 38,500 Marine reservists.  For the Navy, the budget continues to grow the size, and importantly the capability, of the battle fleet – providing for 380,900 active-duty and reserve sailors in FY 2017, and an increase from 280 ships at the end of FY 2016 to 308 ships at the end of the FYDP.  The budget also supports an Air Force of 491,700 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard airmen – maintaining 55 tactical fighter squadrons over the next five years, and providing sufficient manpower to address high operating tempo and shortfalls in maintenance specialists for both tactical fighters and remotely-piloted aircraft. The Right Compensation In FY 2017, the budget provides $177.9 billion in pay and benefits – including health care, housing allowances, commissaries, retirement, and other benefits – for DoD’s 2.1 million military personnel and their families.  I will discuss DoD’s proposed reforms to some of these areas later in this testimony.  To help make sure DoD is competitive for the best talent, the budget includes a department-wide pay raise of 1.6 percent in FY 2017.  This is an increase above FY 2016’s pay raise of 1.3 percent. It’s important to note that of all the cuts we’ve taken to our previously-planned budgets since the Budget Control Act was passed, including cuts from sequestration – altogether so far totaling at least $800 billion over ten years – less than 9 percent of those reductions came from military compensation proposals.  This should make clear that we’ve worked extremely hard to protect our people, and that we do need to address some places where savings can be found, such as through modernizing and simplifying our military healthcare system, which I address later in this testimony. More Than Military Readiness Beyond ensuring the combat readiness of America’s military, our commitment to the force of today also encompasses what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people.  We’re putting a priority on preventing and eliminating sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, investing $246 million in FY 2017 to help support survivors, reduce retaliation for reporting, and eradicate these crimes from our ranks – and soon, DoD will deliver to Congress our strategy on addressing retaliation, in particular.  We’re also helping provide transition support and advocating for employment opportunities for veterans, investing a total of $109 million in FY 2017 so our people can make the most of their potential and keep making a difference when they complete their service in uniform.  And we’re fostering greater diversity of our force, because our strength depends on being open to the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards – young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, open, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. That’s one reason why we’re opening all remaining combat positions to women, so that we have access to 100 percent of our population for every position in the all-volunteer force and every American who can meet our exacting standards has the full and equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  That said, since the declaration that opens all career fields to women is by itself not sufficient for their full integration, I’ve asked the military services to mitigate any concerns about combat effectiveness by incorporating my seven guiding principles – transparent standards, population size, talent management, physical demands and physiological differences, operating abroad, conduct and culture, and assessment and adjustment – into their implementation plans, which I have reviewed and approved and are now being carried out.  First and foremost, this means the services will continue to apply objective standards for all career fields to ensure leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.  This may mean in some cases, equal opportunity may not always equate to equal participation.  Integration provides equal opportunity for men and women who can perform the tasks required; it does not guarantee women will fill these roles in any specific number or at any set rate, as adherence to a merit-based system must continue to be paramount.  Also, we must incorporate concrete ways to mitigate the potential for higher injury rates among women, and leverage lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan to address concerns regarding operating in areas where there is cultural resistance to working with women.  We must address attitudes toward team performance through education and training, including making clear that sexual assault or harassment, hazing, and unprofessional behaviors are never acceptable.  Our core beliefs in good order, discipline, leadership, and accountability are foundational to our success in integration.  And it is absolutely critical that we embark on integration with a commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and in-stride adjustment that enables sustainable success. Finally, it’s important to remember that our commitment to the force of today is not limited to those who serve in uniform.  In FY 2017, it also includes $79.3 billion to support our civilian workforce of 718,000 Americans – men and women across the country and around the world who do critical jobs like helping repair our ships and airplanes, providing logistics support, developing and acquiring weapon systems, supporting survivors of sexual assault, and helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured personnel.  The budget includes $7.7 billion to support our military families, because they serve too.  It includes $3.1 billion to help take care of our wounded warriors, to whom our commitment is and must remain as strong as ever.  And it includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  IV. ADJUSTING TO STRATEGIC CHANGE Another significant portion of our budget goes toward DoD’s current operations all around the world, in every domain, to help defend our country, our allies, and our interests.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to helping the President address key national security challenges, and my priorities for how we must adjust to strategic change – in countering terrorists, whether ISIL, al-Qaeda, or others; in taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression; in operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; in deterring Iranian aggression and malign influence; in standing alert on the Korean Peninsula; and in addressing threats from multiple directions in cyber, space, and electronic warfare.  We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges; we must and will address them all, and not only be prepared across the spectrum of conflict, but also for the possibility of multiple conflicts in overlapping timeframes. Countering Terrorism It is clear that our mission of countering terrorists and other violent extremists around the world will be with us for some time.  The Department of Defense has strong counterterrorism capabilities, and we continue to deploy them to protect America. Dealing ISIL a Lasting Defeat We must and will deal ISIL a lasting defeat, which is why the budget provides $7.5 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Inherent Resolve.  This investment will be critical to continuing to implement and accelerate the coalition military campaign plan that the United States has developed, that our key allies support, and that focuses on three military objectives:  One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by attacking its two power centers in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria; these cities constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic and ideological centers of gravity, which is why our plan has big arrows pointing toward both.  Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear.  And three, our most important mission, which is to protect the homeland. To eliminate the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, DoD is enabling local, motivated forces with critical support from a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities-ranging from airstrikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice and assistance.  It must be local forces who deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, because only they can secure and govern the territory by building long-term trust within the populations they liberate.  We can and will enable such local forces, but we cannot substitute for them.  Accordingly, the budget’s investment in the counter-ISIL campaign includes $630 million for training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces, and $250 million for enabling Syrian anti-ISIL forces. This is a worthy investment, as we’ve already started to see our investments over the last several months start to pay off.  For example, it was Iraqi soldiers who took back Ramadi, reversing a loss the Iraqi army suffered last spring.  Our support to them included advanced training, tactics, air support, and the portable bridges that carried the Iraqi military across the Euphrates River and into the decisive fight.  Ramadi, like recent Iraqi gains in Bayji, Tikrit, and Sinjar, demonstrates that the approach we are taking is having an effect as Iraqis prepare for what will be a tough fight for Mosul.  Likewise in Syria, local anti-ISIL forces we’ve enabled with equipment and ammunition have had successes in Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, and Shaddadi.  It is imperative to keep building on this momentum. As we work with our partners to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas like North and West Africa and Afghanistan.  Having taken out ISIL’s leader in Libya in November, we are also now prepared to step up pressure on ISIL in Afghanistan to check their ambitions there as well. Finally, at the same time that we accelerate our campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners – there can be no free riders.  That’s why in Brussels this February I convened the first-ever meeting of defense ministers from 27 other countries involved in the military coalition to defeat ISIL to follow up after I personally reached out to dozens of defense ministers to urge them to consider filling critical military and non-military needs in the campaign.  And I’m gratified to report that coalition members responded to our challenge – and not only NATO allies like Canada and the Netherlands, but also Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  In sum, nearly 90 percent of the countries participating in the coalition’s military campaign have either stepped up their role or committed to do so in the coming days.  Their decisions to expand air operations, send more trainers, provide logistical support, help with reconstruction, or make other contributions will all help our coalition intensify the counter-ISIL campaign and bring about ISIL’s lasting defeat. None of this changes the fact that our counter-ISIL campaign is a hard and complex fight.  We have tactical and strategic goals, but they will take time – and, as is often said, the enemy gets a vote.  For our part, we will remain focused, committed, and resilient because this is a fight we can, must, and will win, as our efforts to accelerate our campaign are already producing real and promising results. Ensuring Long-Term Stability in Afghanistan After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan, we have to make sure our gains there stick, which is why the budget continues to support our two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).  In support of those two missions, the President announced last fall that the United States will maintain a continued presence of 9,800 troops through most of 2016 before drawing down to 5,500 troops by January 2017.  As I told our troops there when I visited them this past December, while Afghanistan remains a dynamic fight, we are determined to ensure that terrorists – regardless of whether they’re al-Qaeda or ISIL – never have or find safe haven there again. The budget provides $41.7 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel – including funding to support our posture in U.S. Central Command, the full funding of $3.4 billion to support the ANDSF, and $1.4 billion to support other coalition partners.  Importantly, this allows us to continue strengthening and developing the ANDSF’s aviation, logistics, intelligence, and special operations capabilities, with the intent of reducing their dependency on us over time.  Also, in addition to upholding our commitments to Afghanistan, the Afghan people, and other partners, the budget reflects that the United States will retain several key locations in 2016 and beyond, including facilities in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.  As we do so, the United States will support the continuation of the NATO mission in Afghanistan in 2016 and beyond, and continue to consult with our NATO allies and partners to ensure that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan are mutually supportive. Our continued presence in Afghanistan is not only a sensible investment to counter threats that exist and stay ahead of those that could emerge in this volatile region; it also supports the willing partner we have in the government of Afghanistan.  It is in the United States’ interest to help them succeed, for the benefit of their security, our security, the region and the world. Establishing an Alternative to the Detention Facility at Guantanamo The Defense Department is resolutely committed to responsibly closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay through the establishment of an alternative detention facility.  I share the President’s belief – and the belief of many in Congress – that doing so would benefit our national security, which is why DoD will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when we have substantially mitigated any security risks to the United States. Over the last five months, we completed transfers for 27 detainees, bringing the population to 80.  Like every transfer that came before them, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government. That said, because many of the remaining detainees currently cannot be safely transferred to another country, we need an alternative to this detention facility.  Therefore, I support the President’s plan to establish and bring those detainees to an appropriate, secure, alternative location in the United States.  I appreciate that Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal, and, in accordance with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD delivered that plan to Congress in February.  We look forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate design, legislative foundation, and geographic location for future detention and to lift the restrictions preventing the responsible closure of the facility at Guantanamo. Supporting and Maintaining our Counterterrorism Capabilities In addition to the specific funds outlined above, the budget also reflects other investments we’re making in DoD’s posture to ensure we can counter terrorism effectively wherever it challenges us.  For example, the budget sustains our robust funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, allocating $10.8 billion in FY 2017.  To bolster our partners in fighting terrorism, it requests $1 billion for our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  And it supports the development of DoD’s transregional counterterrorism strategy, which I’d like to outline now. The terrorist threat is continually evolving, changing focus, and shifting location, requiring us to be flexible, nimble, and far-reaching in our response.  Accordingly, the Defense Department is leveraging the existing security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe, so that we can counter transnational and transregional terrorist threats like ISIL and others in a sustainable, durable way going forward.  From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain last October to those I visited in Jalalabad, Afghanistan last December, these locations and associated forces in various regions help keep us postured to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds.  In a practical sense, they enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent terrorist group affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the main entities themselves.  This transregional approach is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this in action was our November strike on Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill him.  To help implement this strategy, including in the fight against ISIL and its metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, the budget includes an additional $175 million in FY 2017 – $9 million to help bolster our posture in the Levant, and $166 million to help us better address threats in North and West Africa in conjunction with our European partners. Because the accelerating intensity of our precision air campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria has been depleting our stocks of some of the GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets we use against terrorists the most, the budget invests $1.8 billion in FY 2017 to buy over 45,000 more of them.  Furthermore, DoD is also exploring increasing the production rate of these munitions in our industrial base – calling on America’s great arsenal of democracy to help us and our partners finish the job of defeating ISIL. Also, because our remotely-piloted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft play an important role in countering terrorism, the budget includes $1.2 billion for FY 2017 and $4.5 billion over the FYDP to increase the number of around-the-clock permissive ISR combat air patrols from 70 today to 90 by the end of FY 2018.  Using a mix of MQ-9 Reapers, Extended Range Reapers, and MQ-1C Advanced Gray Eagles – and comprising 60 patrols from the Air Force, 16 from the Army, and 14 that are government-owned and flown by contractors for the Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command – these investments will be critical as the need for ISR continues to increase around the world. Finally, because it helps us maintain a larger Air Force fighter fleet that can drop more smart bombs in our counter-ISIL air campaign, the budget also further defers the A-10 Thunderbolt’s final retirement until 2022.  I saw some of the A-10s that are flying bombing missions against ISIL when I was at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey last December, and we need the additional payload capacity they can bring to the fight.  Accordingly, we are also changing the rate at which we will phase out the A-10 as we approach 2022, as I will explain later in this testimony. A Strong and Balanced Strategic Approach to Deter Russia Despite the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community, and also Russia itself so well for so long.  In Europe, Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  In Syria, Russia has been pouring gasoline on a civil war, fueling the very extremism Russia claims to oppose.  At sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow’s nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to brandishing nuclear weapons. To be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy, even as it may view us that way.  But make no mistake – we will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all.  That’s why the United States is taking a strong and balanced strategic approach in response to Russia’s aggression:  strengthening both our allies and ourselves, including through investments in this budget, while also giving Russia the opportunity, if it chooses, to rejoin the international community and work with us where our interests align. Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, DoD’s budgets have made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies; for example, contributing to NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  This budget builds on that significantly, and breaks new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterring – and, if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future.  The 20th century NATO playbook was successful in working toward a Europe whole, free and at peace, but the same playbook would not be well-matched to the needs of the 21st century.  Together with our NATO allies, we must write a new playbook, which includes preparing to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, better integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to adapt and respond to new challenges and new threats. To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative to make a total investment of $3.4 billion for FY 2017 – more than quadrupling the $789 million that we requested last year – allowing us to increase the amount of prepositioned equipment sets in Europe as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies.  This increase supports the persistent rotational presence of an armored brigade combat team for 12 months out of the year, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European friends and allies.  It supports more warfighting gear, including forward-stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017.  It supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such that this equipment – along with assigned Army airborne and Stryker brigade combat teams and Marine Corps heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – will allow us to rapidly form a highly-capable combined-arms ground force of division-plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C tactical fighter squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft. In addition, the budget reflects how we’re doing more, and in more ways, with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, this includes building toward a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap up to Norway’s North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe’s first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to our British allies.  And, given Russia’s use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – the budget supports more rotational presence of U.S. special operations forces exercising in Europe. The budget also significantly funds important new technologies that, when coupled with revised operational concepts, will ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  While I will address these areas in greater detail later in this posture statement, investments that are most relevant to deterring Russia include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-range anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber, and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for electronic warfare, space, and cyberspace.  The budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent. Consistent with our strong and balanced approach, the door will remain open for Russia to reassume the role of respected partner going forward.  While that would be greatly welcomed by the United States, and the Department of Defense, it’s up to the Kremlin to decide – first by demonstrating a willingness to return to the international community. Operationalizing the Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific The budget also supports operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.  In a region home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy, for 70 years the United States has helped underwrite a stable security environment that allowed the people, economies, and countries in the Asia-Pacific to rise and prosper.  We fully intend to continue these efforts so that bright future can be possible for everyone in this important region. Accordingly, the budget helps improve DoD’s geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable posture in the region, through which the United States seeks to preserve peace and stability, and maintain our strategic advantage in an area that’s critically important to America’s political, economic, and security interests.  Investments in the budget reflect how we’re moving more of our forces to the region – such as 60 percent of our Navy and overseas Air Force assets – and also some of our most advanced capabilities in and around the region, from F-22 stealth fighter jets and other advanced tactical strike aircraft, to P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, to our newest surface warfare ships.  They also reflect how we’re developing and implementing new posture initiatives – in places like Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore, as well as modernizing our existing footprint in Korea and Japan – and continuing to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones, from India to Vietnam.  And they reflect our efforts to support and strengthen a regional security architecture that benefits everyone – from strengthening and modernizing our alliances, to bolstering our ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to building the security capabilities of our many friends and allies, who increasingly want to do more with us in the region.  In support of this effort, the budget fully supports our five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative begun in FY 2016. For this region, as it does with Europe, the budget also significantly funds important new technologies to ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These investments – which I will outline later in this testimony – are important for ensuring our forces can go anywhere, at any time, and succeed in whatever mission we ask of them. It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, because it’s good for the region and good for our collective interests.  That includes China.  As we welcome the growth and prosperity of all Asia-Pacific nations, it is clear that the U.S.-China relationship will be complex as we continue to balance our competition and cooperation.  There are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China – for example, we’ve agreed to four confidence-building agreements, including one meant to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  But there remain areas of concern. For one, the United States joins virtually everyone else in the region in being deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  U.S. military presence in the region is decades-old, has been instrumental in upholding the rules-based international system, and has laid the foundation for peace and security in the region.  Our interest is in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight, full and unimpeded lawful commerce, and that disputes are resolved peacefully.  To accomplish this, we will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  We also expect China to uphold President Xi’s pledge not to pursue militarization in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. Also, we are closely watching the long-term, comprehensive military modernization program that China, as well as other countries, continues to pursue.  While there is no question that the United States retains a decisive military edge in the Asia-Pacific today, China is investing in capabilities to counter third-party – including the United States – intervention during a crisis or conflict.  These capabilities include ballistic and cruise missiles of increasingly greater range and accuracy, counter-space and offensive cyber capabilities, and electronic warfare systems.  To maintain a lasting competitive advantage, DoD is taking prudent steps to preserve and enhance deterrence for the long term.  The budget reflects this, including with investments to continue adapting our forces, posture, operations, and capabilities to deter aggression, defend our allies, and sustain our military edge in the Asia-Pacific. Deterring North Korea The budget also supports investments necessary to deter North Korean provocation and aggression, ensure our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready and capable to ‘fight tonight’ if necessary, and defend against threats emanating from North Korea against the United States and our allies.  This includes threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, against which DoD is fully capable of defending the U.S. homeland.  Our position has been, and remains, that North Korea must abide by its international obligation to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and stop its provocative behavior. North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6th and its ballistic missile launch on February 7th were highly provocative acts that undermine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.  The United States condemns these violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again calls on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.  We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. DoD remains fully capable of fulfilling U.S. treaty commitments to our allies in the event of a North Korean attack, and we’re working with our Republic of Korea allies to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat.  I spoke with my South Korean counterpart shortly after the nuclear test, and reiterated our commitments as strong and steadfast allies.  Also, a few hours after the ballistic missile launch, the United States and the Republic of Korea jointly announced the start of formal consultations to discuss the feasibility of deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the Korean Peninsula at the earliest date. Checking Iran’s Malign Influence while Strengthening Regional Friends and Allies The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges, but there, as everywhere, DoD’s budget – and accordingly our actions and strong military posture – is guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s interests.  Defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria, which I discussed earlier, is of course one of those interests, but amid this region’s complexity and uncertainty, we also have other interests of great importance, which are to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; and to check Iran’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  That’s why DoD maintains tens of thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along with our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action places significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, it does not limit in any way what DoD can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance in order to provide all options, as the President has directed, should Iran walk away from its commitments under this deal.  So if Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can immediately respond and rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. This budget invests in maintaining those abilities going forward, which is important, because Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is contributing to disorder in Yemen, while still directing hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel.  To continue to meet our commitments and enhance our cooperation with our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, the budget makes critical investments – including $146 million to support Israel in FY 2017.  This reflects our unshakeable commitment to Israel and its security, with funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow, and other cooperative defense programs – not only ensuring that Israel can defend itself, but also preserving and enhancing Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is a cornerstone of our defense relationship. Meanwhile, with critical investments in other areas, the budget enables DoD to continue to advance our preparations, posture, partnerships, and planning to preserve the President’s options for any contingency.  It strengthens the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran’s ability to coerce its neighbors.  And it helps us stay ahead of the risks posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, naval forces, cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the region. Addressing Threats in Cyber, Space, and Electronic Warfare Even as we make adjustments in our budget to address the five evolving challenges posed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda, we are also making adjustments to address emerging and increasing threats that transcend individual nations and organizations.  That’s because, as we confront these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also led to vulnerabilities that potential adversaries are eager to exploit. As I made clear when I released DoD’s new cyber strategy last April, we have three missions in cyberspace – first and foremost, to defend our networks, systems, and information; second, to help defend the nation and our interests from cyberattacks of significant consequence, working with other departments and branches of government; and third, to provide options that can augment our other military systems.  Given the increasing severity and sophistication of the threats and challenges we’re seeing in cyberspace – ranging from ISIL’s pervasive online presence to the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management – the budget puts a priority on funding our cyber strategy, investing a total of $6.7 billion in FY 2017 and $34.6 billion over the FYDP.  This is a $900 million increase over last year’s budget.  While these funds will help us continue to develop, train, and equip our growing Cyber Mission Force, and also make new technological investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and capabilities – both of which I address later in this testimony – the budget also reflects our efforts to make a fundamental shift toward a culture of accountability in cyberspace, from instituting a DoD-wide cybersecurity scorecard to monitor our progress to increasing individual knowledge about practical ways to defend against cyber intrusions.  Our people understandably hold themselves to very high standards when it comes to caring for, attending to, using, and being accountable for the weapons they carry into battle, and we must do the same when it comes to interacting with our networks and cyber capabilities – not only among our cyber warriors and IT professionals, but throughout the DoD workforce. While at times in the past space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that’s not the case anymore, and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  This means that as we continue to ensure our access to space so we can provide capabilities like reconnaissance, GPS, and secure communications that enable and enhance our operations in other domains, we must also focus on assuring and defending these capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs of others.  Though competitors may understand our reliance on space, we will not let them use it against us, or take it away.  As I will discuss later in this testimony, this budget makes important investments to do just that – sustaining and building on the major shifts DoD began funding in last year’s budget submission – with a total of more than $22 billion for space in FY 2017.  With the presence of so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet:  free and open to all. Finally, high-end competitors have also invested in electronic warfare systems as a cost-effective way to challenge the United States and try to blunt our technological advantage.  By jamming our radars, communications, and GPS, these systems would seek to disrupt the integrated capabilities that allow our forces to identify, target, reach, and destroy an enemy with precision.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why this budget deliberately invests in buying more electronic protection and resiliency for our current systems as well as developing more advanced capabilities.  I will address these investments in more detail later in this testimony.  V. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE The other significant share of our budget goes toward making sure DoD will be ready for the future.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to create a Defense Department that’s open to change and new ideas to ensure a better future for both DoD and the nation, and my priorities in doing so.  These are best understood through the four key pillars of this commitment – namely, updating and refining warfighting strategies, operational concepts, and tactics; driving smart and essential technological innovation; building the force of the future; and reforming the DoD enterprise. While I will describe what we’re doing in each of those areas momentarily, the dynamic strategic environment I described earlier in this testimony explains why such change is so important – not for the sake of change, but for the security of this country.  We cannot let those challenges overtake us; we have to stay ahead of them and stay the best.  That’s why as Secretary of Defense I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box. Updating and Refining Warfighting Strategies, Operational Concepts, and Tactics Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win both the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, and to make sure that the plans apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats to our security, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  We’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners think about what happens if they have to execute their plan at the same time as another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into the trap of presuming the contingency they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  And we’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we must be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them. As I mentioned earlier, DoD is continuing to embark on a force-wide, all-service transition from an era focused on counterinsurgency operations to an era focused on the full spectrum of military operations.  While we do so for many important reasons, it’s also important to note that we don’t want to forget or turn our back on counterinsurgency, but rather enable most of our forces to be capable of doing a lot more than just that.  A smaller segment of our force will still specialize in these skills, and DoD will retain the ability to expand our operational capacity for counterinsurgency missions should it become necessary. The transition to full-spectrum operations is and will be coupled with demonstrations to clearly signal it and make that signal credible, which is key to conventional deterrence.  The same is true for our investments in capabilities – in new technologies, new operational concepts, and also innovative ways for how we use what we already have – these must and will be demonstrated as well.  This is accounted for in the budget, as are other investments we’re making to recommit ourselves to deterrence across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict. Recognizing the immense value that wargaming has historically had in strengthening our force in times of strategic, operational, and technological transition – such as during the interwar years between World War I and World War II, when air, land, and naval wargamers developed innovative approaches in areas like tank warfare and carrier aviation – this budget makes significant new investments to reinvigorate and expand wargaming efforts across the Defense Department.  With a total of $55 million in FY 2017 as part of $526 million over the FYDP, this will allow us to try out nascent operational concepts and test new capabilities that may create operational dilemmas and impose unexpected costs on potential adversaries.  The results of future wargames will be integrated into DoD’s new wargaming repository, which was recently established to help our planners and leaders better understand and shape how we use wargames while also allowing us to share the insights we gain across the defense enterprise. Driving Smart and Essential Technological Innovation The investments this budget makes in technology and innovation, and the bridges it helps build and rebuild, are critical to staying ahead of future threats in a changing world.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially DoD.  Today, not only is much more technology commercial, but the competition is global, with other countries trying to catch up with the advances we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber, and space.  So now, as we have in the past, DoD must invest to ensure America pioneers and dominates these and other technological frontiers. DoD is therefore pursuing new technology development along with new operational concepts, and new organizational constructs – all of which are reflected in or supported by this budget submission – to maintain our military’s technological superiority and ensure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.  How we do this is important, because while the Cold War arms race was characterized mostly by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, this era of technological competition is uniquely characterized by an additional variable of speed, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy; what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to upgrade them and repurpose them to be used in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats. In particular, this means leveraging the capability of current and emerging technologies, including commercial technologies wherever appropriate.  It means demonstrating and seeding investments in new capabilities and concepts to counter advanced anti-access, area-denial challenges across all domains and in every region where they persist – a particular focus of DoD’s effort to develop a third offset strategy.  And also, it means investing in and operationalizing our security by leveraging advances in cyber, space, electronic warfare, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other areas.  Our technologies and capabilities must be able to operate so that no matter what any of our enemies might throw at them, they are able to defeat attempts to be hacked. Accordingly, this budget invests a total of $183.9 billion in FY 2017, and $951 billion over the FYDP, to help research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and capabilities our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  For the second year in a row, the budget increases funding for our research and development accounts, which total $71.8 billion in FY 2017.  That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services, in our dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country, and in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing. At the same time that DoD is making investments in technologies themselves, we’re also investing in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s vibrant, innovative technology community and forging more connections with the commercial technology base – and it’s reflected in our budget.  In FY 2017, this includes $45 million for our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx), which we opened in Silicon Valley last August to build relationships and better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem.  It also includes $40 million for our pilot program with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel, leveraging its venture capital model to help find innovative solutions for some of our most challenging problems.  And it includes $137 million to support our public-private partnership-funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics that I announced in Silicon Valley last August.  In all these areas, similar to how DoD’s historic investments in things like GPS and the Internet later went on to yield great benefits for not just our security but also our society, we hope the investments we’re making in some of these fields along with our partners in the technology industry will lead to incredible advances that today we can only imagine. Importantly, technological innovation must be done in concert with operational innovation.  It’s not enough to have or create new technologies or weapon systems; how they are used is key.  The budget reflects work DoD has been undertaking in this area though multiple lines of effort.  First, there’s our Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program – an effort named after the mid-1970s project that brought together a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts who paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth – and also our Advanced Capability and Deterrence Panel.  Both focus on identifying and charting longer-term, leap-ahead investments for strategies and capabilities that will give us an advantage several decades from now, and together they make up nearly 60 percent of our science and technology investments in this budget submission. Now, to focus on maintaining our near-term advantage, DoD has an office that we don’t often talk about, but that I want to highlight today.  It’s called the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO).  I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense to reimagine existing DoD, intelligence community, and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  I picked a talented physicist to lead it.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but also has the rare virtue of rapid development and the even rarer charter to keep current capabilities viable for as long as possible.  So it’s good for both troops and taxpayers alike. SCO is focused on thinking differently, which is incredibly important to innovation when it comes to technological capabilities.  Thinking differently put us in space and on the moon.  It put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips.  It’s how we came to have airplanes that take off from the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, and satellite networks that take pictures of the world and show us where we are in it.  And this kind of bold, innovative thinking isn’t lost to history.  It’s happening every day, in SCO and many other places throughout the Department of Defense. Most people don’t often hear about it because most of its work is classified; however, SCO has been a tremendously useful part of DoD.  It’s received large support from all the services, as well as our combatant commands, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and also Congress – with its budget growing from $140 million in its first year, FY 2014, to reaching $845 million for FY 2017 in this year’s budget submission.  To show the return we’re getting on those investments, I’d like to highlight some projects SCO has been working on that we’re funding in the budget. First is a project focused on advanced navigation, where SCO is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads – enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand. Another SCO project uses swarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.  For the air, they’ve developed micro-drones that are really fast, and really resilient – they can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk.  Each one leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the micro-drones use a lot of commercial components and 3D printing.  And the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote for the Mars lander. SCO also has a project on gun-based missile defense, where we’re taking the same hypervelocity smart projectile developed for the electromagnetic railgun, and using it for point defense by firing it with artillery we already have in our inventory – including the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin earlier this year, and we found that it also significantly increases the range. There’s also a SCO project that we’re calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms, and turns it into a flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads.  In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes – essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities. The last SCO project I want to highlight is how we’re creating a brand new capability with the SM-6 missile, an interceptor that’s designed to launch from our Navy’s surface ships and be highly maneuverable and aerodynamic to stop incoming ballistic and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.  It’s one of our most modern and capable munitions – and thanks to work done by SCO, we’ve been able to modify the SM-6 so that in addition to missile defense, it can also target enemy ships at sea.  This new anti-ship mode makes the SM-6 doubly useful, taking the defensive speed and maneuverability already sitting in our Aegis destroyers’ launch cells and leveraging it for offensive surface warfare lethality.  That makes it a potent new capability for our fleet, and also a good deal for the taxpayer by using the same thing twice.  We already know this works; it was fully tested this past January to great success.  And, as I will address later in this testimony, this new operational concept is strongly reflected in our 2017 budget. Those are just a few projects that SCO has worked on so far – and they’re working on a lot more, including some surprising ones. Now, with all of that in mind – from why we need to invest in technological innovation, to how we’re doing it – let me address the specific investments this budget makes in technologies and capabilities to deter, and if necessary fight and win, a full-spectrum conventional war against even the most high-end of adversaries.  In concert, they will help maintain our military’s edge both under and on the sea, on land, in the air, in space, in cyber and electronic warfare, and in the modernization and maintenance of our nuclear enterprise. Maritime Investments In the maritime domain, the budget refocuses our Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts while continuing to grow the battle fleet to meet, but not exceed, the department’s warfighting posture requirement of 308 ships.  Our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years. First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – leveraging and growing our commanding lead in an area where the U.S. military should be doing more, not less, going forward.  It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, including $170.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.5 billion over the FYDP for an improved heavyweight torpedo as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo to stay ahead of existing and emerging undersea challenges.  It includes $5.2 billion in FY 2017 and $29.4 billion over the FYDP to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; four of those submarines – up from three in last year’s budget – will be equipped with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that can more than triple each submarine’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles to 40.  The budget also invests $500 million in FY 2017, and $3.4 billion over the FYDP, to upgrade 49 of our submarines’ combat systems and enhance underwater acoustics on nine of our existing Virginia-class submarines.  It increases funding for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) by over $100 million in FY 2017, part of a total $173 million in FY 2017 and $1.2 billion over the FYDP that invests in, among other areas, rapid prototyping of UUVs in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – which is important, since UUVs can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  And it includes $2.2 billion in FY 2017 and $6.4 billion over the FYDP to continue procuring the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft.   Together, all these investments – totaling $8.2 billion in FY 2017, and $41.9 billion over the next five years – will ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world. Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary prevail in a full-spectrum conflict against even the most advanced adversaries.  It invests $597 million in FY 2017, and $2.9 billion over the FYDP, to maximize production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, procuring 125 in FY 2017 and 625 over the next five years – and this investment is doubly important given the SM-6’s new anti-ship capability.  It also invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads – including $1 billion in FY 2017, and $5.8 billion over the FYDP, for all variants of the SM-3 high-altitude ballistic missile interceptor; $340 million in FY 2017, and $925 million over the FYDP, for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile; $221 million in FY 2017, and $1.4 billion over the FYDP, for the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, including its extended range version; and $435 million in FY 2017, as part of $2.1 billion over the FYDP, for the most advanced variant of the Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which once upgraded can also be used for maritime strike. Third, the budget reflects decisions we’ve made to ensure that we look at our overall warfighting posture, rather than only the presence that contributes to it, in determining whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict.  Having grown the size and the capability of our surface and subsurface fleet over the last seven years, this budget will continue to do both.  It will ensure we meet the department’s 308-ship posture requirement – indeed, growing the battle fleet to 308 ships by the end of the FYDP – and it will make our naval forces as a whole more capable, more survivable, and more lethal than they would have been otherwise. The budget invests $3.4 billion in FY 2017 and $18.3 billion over the FYDP to continue to buy two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 over the FYDP – as well as $400 million in FY 2017 and $2.8 billion over the FYDP for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing $2.7 billion in FY 2017 and $13.5 billion over the FYDP for new construction of Ford-class carriers, as well as $2 billion in FY 2017 and $8.9 billion over the FYDP for midlife reactor refueling and overhauls on our current carrier fleet.  And, as I will discuss in the reform section of this testimony, it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers – providing them with more capability and a longer lifespan while freeing up significant funds that can be put toward a variety of uses. I’d like to now address the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), where we made an important tradeoff so we could put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and many other critical areas.  As such, the budget takes a new approach to the LCS and its associated frigate – buying a total of 40, not the 52 or more that were planned starting back in 2002.  Let me explain why.  First, to be clear, we’re investing in LCS and frigates because we need the capability they provide, and for missions like minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare, they’re expected to be very capable.  But now, in 2016, we have to further balance our shipbuilding investments among guided missile destroyers and Virginia-class attack submarines.  We face competitors who are challenging us on the open ocean with new submarines, ships, aircraft, and missiles – advanced capabilities we haven’t had to contend with in a long time, meaning that we must now invest more in higher-end capabilities across our own fleet.  The department’s warfighting analysis called for 40 small surface combatants, so that’s how many we’re buying.  Over the next 10 years, this will let us invest almost $8 billion more into highly lethal ships and capabilities – all the while increasing both the number of ships and the capability of our battle fleet.  While this will somewhat reduce the number of LCS available for presence operations, that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface, and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries.  Under this rebalanced plan, we will still achieve our 308-ship goal within the next five years, and we will be better positioned as a force to effectively deter, and if necessary defeat, even the most advanced potential adversaries. Land Investments To ensure our ground forces have the capabilities to counter emerging threats and the demonstrated ability to deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict, the budget will help provide our Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces with greater lethality in several forms.  This includes a next-generation shoulder-launched weapon, a life extension program as well as a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can be used for improved counter-battery and long-range strike, and increased firepower for Stryker armored fighting vehicles.  Together these investments comprise $780 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP. Additionally, the budget invests $735 million in FY 2017, and $6.8 billion over the FYDP, in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle intended to replace the military’s Humvees – procuring more than 2,000 vehicles in FY 2017, and a total of more than 17,700 vehicles over the next five years.  It also invests $159 million in FY 2017, and $1.7 billion over the FYDP, in the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which will replace the Marine Corps’ aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle – helping procure over 200 vehicles over the next five years.  And, as I discuss later in the reform section of this testimony, it supports the Army’s ongoing Aviation Restructure Initiative – investing $1.1 billion for 52 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.7 billion for 275 Apaches over the FYDP, as well as $1 billion for 36 UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.6 billion for 268 Black Hawks over the FYDP. The budget also invests $9.1 billion for missile defense in FY 2017, and $47.1 billion over the FYDP.  This reflects important decisions we’ve made to strengthen and improve our missile defense capabilities – particularly to counter the anti-access, area-denial challenge of increasingly precise and increasingly long-range ballistic and cruise missiles being fielded by several nations in multiple regions of the world.  Instead of spending more money on a smaller number of more traditional and expensive interceptors, we’re funding a wide range of defensive capabilities that can defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby impose higher costs on the attacker.  The budget invests in improvements that complicate enemy targeting, harden our bases, and leverage gun-based point defense capabilities – from upgrading the Land-Based Phalanx Weapons System, to developing hypervelocity smart projectiles that as I mentioned earlier can be fired not only from the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, but also the hundreds of Army M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  Additionally, the budget’s missile defense investments maintain DoD’s commitment to improving our homeland and theater defense systems – as we’re increasing the number of deployed Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) from 30 to 44, redesigning the exo-atmospheric kill vehicle to improve the reliability of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, and funding improvements and follow-on concept development for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Specifically, we’re investing $1.2 billion in FY 2017 and $5.8 billion over the FYDP for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program; for THAAD, we’re spending $640 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP, which includes procuring 24 interceptors in FY 2017 and 149 over the FYDP; and, to research, develop, and deploy a new Long-Range Discrimination Radar, we’re investing $317 million in FY 2017 and $1 billion over the FYDP. Air Investments To ensure the U.S. military’s continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in several areas – and not just platforms, but also payloads.  For example, it invests $2.4 billion in FY 2017 and $8 billion over the FYDP in a wide range of versatile munitions – including buying more Small Diameter Bombs, JDAMs, Hellfires, and AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.  We are also developing hypersonics that can fly over five times the speed of sound. The budget continues to buy the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.  It includes $10.1 billion in FY 2017 and $56.3 billion over the FYDP to procure a total of 404 F-35s across the force through 2021 – 43 F-35As for the Air Force in FY 2017 as part of 243 to be purchased over the FYDP, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 97 to be purchased over the FYDP, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 64 to be purchased over the FYDP.  This represents a slight deferral in Air Force F-35 procurement, which we’re doing in order to free up funds to maintain a larger-size Air Force of 55 tactical fighter squadrons, and to improve avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, and B-52 fleets – increasing their lethality, survivability, and therefore usefulness in a full-spectrum conflict.  At the same time, it also represents an increase in the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-35 procurement, which is important to ensure sufficient high-end capability and numbers in our aircraft carriers’ tactical fighter fleet. Additionally, the budget invests $1.4 billion in FY 2017 and $12.1 billion over the FYDP for continued development of the B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as $3.1 billion in FY 2017 and $15.7 billion over the FYDP to continue upgrading our aerial tanker fleet – buying 15 KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers in FY 2017 as part of 75 aircraft to be purchased over the FYDP. The budget also reflects important decisions regarding future unmanned aerial systems, such as the Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), formerly known as the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Air Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program – by focusing in the near-term on providing carrier-based aerial refueling, we’re setting the stage for a future unmanned carrier air wing.  With this approach, the Navy will be able to quickly and affordably field the kinds of unmanned systems that its carrier air wings need today, while laying an important foundation for future, more capable unmanned carrier-based platforms.  We know we need to ensure aircraft can operate off the carrier in high-threat environments, and we’re working hard to make them unmanned – it’s just that the UCLASS program as previously structured was not the fastest path to get us there.  This approach will allow us to get started integrating unmanned aircraft onto our aircraft carriers affordably and as soon as possible. Furthermore, to maximize the capabilities and extend the reach of all our airborne systems, the budget reflects how we’re expanding manned-unmanned teaming – from buying Navy MQ-4C Triton unmanned maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft, which can be paired with our P-8A Poseidon aircraft for a variety of missions; to buying Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that can pair with MQ-1C Gray Eagle scouts; to buying Air Force F-35s that can network with both payloads and platforms. Cyber and Electronic Warfare Investments This budget significantly increases our cyber capabilities, with new investments totaling over $900 million in FY 2017 compared to last year’s budget. Because defending our networks is and must be DoD’s number-one mission in cyberspace, the budget makes significant investments to improve our defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding.  These include $336 million over the FYDP to support more capable network perimeter defenses, as well as $378 million over the FYDP to train and strengthen DoD’s Cyber Protection Teams to respond to security breaches, grow our cyber training and testing ranges, and support tool development that will let our Cyber Mission Force quickly respond to cyberattacks against our networks regardless of where they are stationed around the world. Reflecting our renewed commitment to deterring even the most advanced adversaries, the budget also invests in cyber deterrence capabilities, including building potential military response options.  This effort is focused on our most active cyber aggressors, and is based around core principles of resiliency, denial, and response. As part of DoD’s second cyber mission – defending the nation – the budget invests in an advanced capability to disrupt cyberattacks of significant consequences.  And to support DoD’s third cyber mission – providing offensive cyber options that if directed can augment our other military systems – the budget invests $347 million over the FYDP to help provide cyber tools and support infrastructure for the Cyber Mission Force and U.S. Cyber Command. DoD has a unique level of resources and cyber expertise compared to the rest of the federal government, and following the recent data breaches of the Office of Personnel Management’s information technology systems, DoD has undertaken responsibility for the development, maintenance, and cybersecurity of the replacement background investigation systems and their data infrastructure.  To provide proper support and a dedicated funding stream for this effort, the President’s budget includes $95 million for DoD in FY 2017.  Also, on a separate but related note, the budget invests $454 million over the FYDP to ensure DoD will continue to have access to the trusted microelectronic components needed in our weapon systems.  By developing alternative sources for advanced microchips and trusted designs, this funding will help ensure the long-term security of our systems and capabilities. Meanwhile, to protect our platforms and ensure U.S. freedom of maneuver in contested environments, the budget also continues to support research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of advanced electronic warfare capabilities – totaling $3.7 billion in FY 2017 and $20.5 billion over the FYDP.  To enhance the electronic survivability and lethality of fighter and bomber aircraft like the F/A-18, F-15, and B-2, we’re investing in both offensive and defensive airborne capabilities, including the Air Force’s Defensive Management System modernization and Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, and also the Navy’s Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures and Next Generation Jammer.  We’re upgrading the radar on our E-3 Sentry AWACS with enhanced electronic protection to make adversary jammers less effective.  Investments in the Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program will help our ships protect themselves better.  And to help protect our ground forces, the budget invests in the Army’s Common Infrared Countermeasures and Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, as well as the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger pod. While cyber and electronic warfare capabilities provide, for the most part, different techniques to achieve similar mission objectives, an integrated approach can yield additional benefits.  This is reflected in our budget, including investments intended to ensure we can hold even the most challenging targets at risk. Space Investments As I mentioned earlier, this budget continues and builds upon important investments in last year’s budget to help secure U.S. access to space and address space as an operational domain. After adding over $5 billion in new investments in DoD’s 2016 budget submission to make us better postured for contested military operations in space – including over $2 billion in space control efforts to address potential threats to U.S. space systems – this budget largely sustains those investments over the FYDP.  While there is much more work ahead, we are on a good path in our efforts to complicate an adversary’s ability to defeat our systems while also enhancing our ability to identify, attribute, and negate all threatening actions in space. Meanwhile, the budget also supports strengthening our current space-based capabilities, and maturing our space command and control.  It invests in more satellites for our Space-Based Infrared System to maintain the robust strategic missile warning capability we have today.  And it allocates $108 million over the FYDP to implement the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), which will better align joint operations in space across the U.S. government. DoD must have assured access to space through multiple reliable sources that can launch our critical national security satellites, which is why the budget invests $1.8 billion for space launch in FY 2017 and $9.4 billion over the FYDP.  Because we want to end the use of the foreign RD-180 engine as soon as possible, because we have a strong desire to preserve competition for space launch in order to ensure multiple launch service providers can sustain uninterrupted access to space, and to control costs, the budget includes funds for competitive public-private partnerships to help develop new launch services, which we believe is the most responsible way forward.  Merely developing a new engine would not give us the assured access to space that we require.  We plan to take advantage of the emerging commercial space launch marketplace using an innovative, more commercial approach – investing through competition in new launch services in return for priced options for future launches. Nuclear Enterprise Investments The budget also makes reforms and investments needed to continue providing a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.  Compared to last year’s budget submission, it adds $10 billion over the next five years, for a total of $19 billion in FY 2017 and $108 billion over the FYDP for maintaining, and modernizing the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control, and communications systems.  This reflects DoD’s continuing commitment to the nuclear triad and its critical mission. In addition to making an array of investments across the nuclear enterprise – from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance, to technological efforts that improve the sustainability of our bomber fleet – the budget also fully funds the first stages of our key nuclear modernization effort, in particular the replacement of our Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.  The Ohio Replacement Program is allocated $1.9 billion in FY 2017 and $13.2 billion over the FYDP, which in addition to research and development will allow the first year of construction on an incrementally-funded first ship to begin in FY 2021. We expect the total cost of nuclear modernization to be in the range of $350-$450 billion.  Although this still presents an enormous affordability challenge for DoD, we believe it must be funded.  Previous modernizations of America’s strategic deterrent and nuclear security enterprise were accomplished by topline increases to avoid having to make drastic reductions to conventional forces, and it would be prudent to do so again.  I hope DoD can work with Congress to minimize the risk to our national defense. Building the All-Volunteer Force of the Future While we have the finest fighting force in the world today, that excellence is not a birthright, and we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again, starting with our most enduring advantage – our people. That’s what building the force of the future is all about:  making sure that long into the future, my successors will be able to count on the same excellence in people that I do today.  And we have several overarching priorities to help us do that, like attracting a new generation of talented Americans, promoting diversity, and rewarding merit; carving tunnels through the walls between DoD, the private sector, our reserve force, and other agencies across the government; and updating and modernizing our personnel management systems with technology and data analysis to help improve the choices and decisions we make related to our people. I made this commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school in Abington, Pennsylvania to outline my vision for the force of the future.  I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and labor market changes, we in the Pentagon must try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans.  In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century.  And this past December, I announced that we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force. Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  It’s not a business.  We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows our friends and family members and fellow citizens to go to school, go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give the next generation a better future. The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. Last spring I asked DoD’s Personnel and Readiness chief to lead a team in developing a package of bold proposals, which they did – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and also coming up with some new ideas.  Subsequently, a senior leadership team led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva has been working with the service vice chiefs to closely analyze each proposal and make recommendations before I decide.  While this process is still ongoing for some proposals, I’ve decided to announce my decisions on other proposals as I’ve made them, which I will now detail. Greater Permeability and Talent Management I outlined the first link we’re building to the force of the future at George Washington University last November, announcing over a dozen new initiatives in several categories that are intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent. First, we’re creating what we call ‘on-ramps’ for people who aren’t involved with DoD but want to try contributing to our mission.  One way we’re doing this is by having better managed internship programs that more effectively transition promising interns into employees.  Another is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community for a time to help solve some of our most complex problems.  We’re also going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two.  And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles, as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Second, we’re creating short-term ‘off-ramps’ for those currently in DoD, so they can gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives from outside and then bring them back in to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking.  One way we’re doing this is by expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family.  DoD plans to seek authorities to make this program permanent, and looks forward to working with Congress to do so – similar to how we were able to partner last year to update and modernize retirement benefits and ensure that the 80 percent of our force that doesn’t serve 20 years will get the benefits they earned whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life. And third, we’re going to use 21st century data and technology to improve and modernize our talent management systems.  We’re launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help give servicemembers and units more choice in matching up for future assignments.  We’re creating an Office of People Analytics to leverage big data to inform our personnel policies.  We’re finally implementing exit surveys, so we can have quantitative data on why people decide to leave.  And to help us keep bringing in the best people, we’re looking at ways to evaluate recruit performance, improve outcomes, and better analyze trends that if left unchecked could indicate or lead to our military’s insularity from the rest of society. Family Support and Retention Next, in January, I announced our so-called second link to the force of the future, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life.  They were developed keeping in mind DoD’s recruiting, retention, and career and talent management needs, as well as our closely-linked readiness and warfighting demands, which must always guide us. We know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force – 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages, with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other.  So while we recruit a servicemember, we retain a family.  This means that what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we’re a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit, is absolutely essential to our future strength.  While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known; among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top.  We also know that at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services.  And we know that a high level of work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service. To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work-life balance.  These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly four-in-five of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce – twice the rate of baby boomers.  These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly. That’s why, for starters, we’re providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force – setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, and working with Congress to seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  These changes put DoD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  For both mothers and fathers alike, this establishes the right balance of offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force.  While I don’t take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we’re providing across the joint force.  This will be an increasingly important factor as current and future generations of parents have different views and expectations in parenting, and we must continue to be able to attract and retain the best talent among them. Additionally, we’re expanding the childcare we provide on our bases, because whether for single parents, for families in which both parents work outside the home, or for every mother or father in our military, childcare hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands.  So based on feedback from pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase childcare access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with childcare they can rely on –from before reveille to after taps – we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  And we show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals. We’re also making relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breastfeeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, we’re requiring the installation or modification of mothers’ rooms throughout all facilities when there are more than 50 women regularly assigned. Furthermore, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time preserving our force’s effectiveness.  Data indicates that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active-duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness.  DoD will be seeking legislative authority to this effect – when the needs of the force permit a servicemember to stay at their current location, we will seek to empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation. Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  To account for this more fully in the benefits we provide our troops, DoD will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active-duty servicemembers – a benefit that will help provide our men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers. Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries.  The initiatives approved to date total $867 million across the FYDP; we’ve included this in our budget because it’s a worthy investment that will yield great returns. More Still to Come While these first two links are important, we will have more to announce on the force of the future in the coming months.  For example, we’re taking a serious look at some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system, and I greatly appreciate Congressional leaders from both parties who have indicated their support for such reforms in principle.  We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions.  In both of these efforts, working with Congress will be essential to ensure that our force of the future is as strong as the force of today. Reforming the DoD Enterprise As I’ve said consistently from the moment I became Secretary of Defense, I cannot ask for more taxpayer dollars for defense without being candid about the fact that not every defense dollar is spent as wisely or responsibly as it could be, and also being determined to change that and make our department more accountable.  That’s why reforming the DoD enterprise is so important – from improving how we’re organized so we can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the future security environment, to continuing to improve our acquisition and enterprise-wide business and audit practices, to reducing excess infrastructure and overhead, to modernizing the military healthcare system. Before I address the reforms in this budget submission, it’s important to consider the recent history of defense reform – how DoD has been embarked on a reform path for much of the last seven years, and how we appreciate Congress’s work with us over the last year on acquisition and modernized retirement reforms. Despite what some may think, this administration hasn’t been dragging its feet when it comes to defense reform – the reality has been quite the opposite.  Beginning in 2009, we reduced the number of senior executives and general and flag officers, while working with Congress to trim management headquarters staffs by 20 percent, and move DoD toward auditability.  We’ve done three iterations of the Better Buying Power initiative I established to continuously improve our acquisitions, with Better Buying Power 3.0 incorporated into this budget, and we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time.  And we’ve continually submitted much-needed reforms to strengthen the efficiency and capability of our force – many of which have been continually denied, either in whole or in part, at a cost for both taxpayers and our troops.  This last part poses a real problem, because every dollar Congress denies us in reform is a dollar we can’t invest in security we need to deter and defend against today’s and tomorrow’s threats. Now is the time for action.  DoD will work closely with Congress on any anticipated reform legislation, and we welcome an open and collaborative process.  In the past, legislative reform has proven to be a double-edged sword – sometimes it leads to constructive change, which is good, but other times it just adds to bureaucracy and overhead, even if that was never the intent.  I hope that with the focus on reform we’ve recently been seeing in this and the other defense committees in Congress, we can work together to do reform right.  And we should, because there’s a lot that needs to be accomplished in many areas. Continuously Improving Acquisition DoD has been, and still is, absolutely committed to improving acquisition outcomes.  After five years of implementing our Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives for continuous process improvements in the defense acquisition system, we’re seeing compelling indications of significant improvement in acquisition outcomes – for example, annual growth metrics for contracted costs on our major programs have dropped dramatically from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2011 to a 30-year low of 3.5 percent in 2015, and a much higher percentage of major programs are projecting cost reductions relative to initial baselines than in the past.  While these developments are positive signs, we can and must do more to sustain and where possible accelerate our momentum to keep improving and deliver better military capability while protecting American taxpayers. We need to continue reducing overhead and bureaucracy associated with the acquisition system, making it more agile and having a faster flow of commercial technology into our weapon systems.  DoD is comfortable with the reforms in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act – which included several legislative reforms that DoD proposed last year – and we strongly support the increased role of the service chiefs in acquisition programs, particularly on cost and requirements trade-offs.  Going forward, it’s important that we take the responsible approach to absorb these reforms and see their effects before making additional major changes. DoD also appreciates Congress’s interest in flexibility and agility, because the pace of threat changes and technology development are not compatible with our long cycles of budget submission, authorization, and appropriations.  And DoD will be looking for opportunities to work with Congress to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our acquisition process.  In particular, we would welcome greater flexibility in appropriations or reprogramming to initiate development of urgently needed capabilities.  The flexibility to start a program as soon as a threat is identified would save critical time – as much as two years under current practices – and position both DoD and industry to more quickly initiate development, without a long-term commitment, outside the traditional budget cycle.  This step would represent a ‘free’ two years of lead time to acquiring a new capability. Leaner Business Practices and Reducing Excess Overhead and Infrastructure The budget submission reflects several important efforts to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently, generating savings that would be much better invested in other areas like the fight against ISIL or deterring Russian aggression. Part of this means making more reductions to overhead, and also adopting some commonsense business practices that are long overdue – which in total we expect to help save nearly $8 billion over the next five years.  By better managing the 20 percent management headquarters reductions I mentioned earlier, including delayering and flattening management organizational structures, and also by increasing the reduction to 25 percent, reviewing service contracts, and making business operations and IT more efficient, we expect to save close to $5.9 billion over the FYDP.  And we’re modernizing how we manage our commissaries and military exchanges, to optimize their business practices and respond to the changing needs of their customers.  Unlike commissary and military exchange reforms proposed in previous budgets, this new approach protects the benefits they provide our people while still generating expected savings of about $2 billion over the FYDP. We’re also making real progress on reforming DoD’s myriad systems and business processes to meet our commitment to be audit ready by the beginning of FY 2018.  The three military departments began audits of their budgets for the first time last year, and DoD financial audits currently cover over 75 percent of our total General Fund budgetary resources and just over 90 percent of the current year dollars. In addition, we need to stop spending so much money to hold onto bases we don’t need, and implement a domestic round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2019 as we’re requesting.  While it’s helpful that the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act allowed a study of DoD’s excess infrastructure, the bottom line is that we have more bases in more places than we need, with preliminary analysis indicating that we have over 20 percent excess infrastructure.  To ignore this fact while criticizing DoD for wasteful spending is not only a sin of omission, but also a disservice to America’s taxpayers.  Last year’s Congressional denial forced the BRAC round to slip from 2017 to 2019, further prolonging our ability to harvest savings we greatly need.  By then it will have been 14 years since DoD was allowed to right-size its domestic infrastructure, which any business leader or citizen would think is ridiculous – and they’d be right.  Now is the time to fix it. Reexamining Goldwater-Nichols and Defense Institutional Reform I appreciate that Congress shares my desire to make institutional reform a priority.  As a learning organization, the U.S. military and the Defense Department has a long history of striving to reform our command structures and improve how our strategies and policies are formulated, integrated, and implemented.  Indeed, even before the Defense Department was even established, military leaders and policymaking officials were discussing how the military services could be unified, and exploring ways to develop stronger policy processes and advice.  The result was the National Security Act of 1947 and its amendments, which, among other historic changes, established the position of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council.  Later reforms, particularly Eisenhower-era changes, helped strengthen the offices of the Defense Secretary and gave new authorities to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But it was the Goldwater-Nichols Act, enacted 30 years ago this fall, that’s most responsible for today’s military and defense institutional organization.  It solidified the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the Combatant Commanders.  It affirmed civilian control of the military by codifying in law that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is outside the chain of command, in order for him to be able to provide vital, objective, independent military advice to the Defense Secretary and the President.  At the same time, it also strengthened the Chairman’s role, created the position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and centralized the role and voice of the Combatant Commands.  And it reinforced the concept of jointness, especially with respect to the careers of senior officers, by requiring them to gain professional experience outside of their service in order to advance further in their careers.  All senior officers know these policies today, for they are integral to career advancement and achievement, and they reflect the reality of how our servicemembers train and fight every day as a joint force.  Around this time, albeit unrelated to Goldwater-Nichols, important changes were made to reform defense acquisition, based on the recommendations of the Packard Commission. As a whole, all these changes were overwhelmingly beneficial – a credit to the work of not only the members of Congress who passed the legislation, but also their staffs.  What they put into law has given us generations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who’ve grown accustomed to operating together as a joint force – overcoming many inter-service frictions of decades before.  And it’s enabled our nation to draw greater benefit from the advice of many valued Chairmen – from General Colin Powell during Operation Desert Storm, to General Joe Dunford today. This year, as Goldwater-Nichols turns 30, we can see that the world has changed since it was enacted: instead of the Cold War and one clear threat, we face a security environment that’s dramatically different, even from the last quarter-century.  It’s time that we consider practical updates to this critical organizational framework, while still preserving its spirit and intent.  For example, we can see in some areas how the pendulum between service equities and jointness may have swung too far, as in not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability; or where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, as in taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman and the Joint Chiefs to support force management, planning, and execution across the combatant commands, particularly in the face of threats that cut across regional and functional combatant command areas of responsibility, as many increasingly do. With this in mind, last fall I asked DoD’s Deputy Chief Management Officer, Peter Levine, and Lieutenant General Tom Waldhauser of the Joint Staff, to lead a comprehensive, department-wide review of these kinds of organizational issues – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, and the military departments – to identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of possible improvement. And they’ve now come to some preliminary recommendations. Over the coming weeks, we will execute some of these decisions under our own existing authority.  For others, where legislation is needed, we would like to work with Congress on implementation as it considers this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.  Of course, both House and Senate Armed Services Committees have their own important reviews of this issue underway as well – making this area ripe for working together, something we’ve been doing effectively, and will continue to do on this topic.  Because when it comes to these fundamental matters of our national security, that’s what we have to do – work together. First, we need to better develop transregional and multifunctional integration and advice – an imperative considering that the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  Terrorism is one example, of course; beyond that, we also face potential future nation-state adversaries with widening geographic reach, but also widening exposure – something we may want to take into account in order to de-escalate a crisis and deter aggression.  And in other cases, we may have to respond to multiple threats across the globe in overlapping time frames.  In an increasingly complex security environment like this, and with a decision chain that cuts across the combatant commands only at the level of the Secretary of Defense, we’re not postured to be as agile as we could be.  Accordingly, we need to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, and in some cases the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Staff, in three ways: one, to help synchronize resources globally for daily operations around the world, enhancing our flexibility, and my ability, to move forces rapidly across the seams between our combatant commands; two, to provide objective military advice for ongoing operations, not just future planning; and three, to advise the Secretary of Defense on military strategy and operational plans, for example, helping ensure that our plans take into account in a deliberate fashion the possibility of overlapping contingencies.  We will pursue these changes in line with Goldwater-Nichols’s original intent, which is to enable the military to better operate in a seamless way, while still preserving both civilian control and the Chairman’s independence to provide professional military advice outside of the chain of command.  Some have recommended the opposite course – to put the Chairman into the chain of command – but both Chairman Dunford and I agree that would erode the Chairman’s objectivity as the principal military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense. The second area where we need to make updates is in our combatant commands – adapting them to new functions, and continuing to aggressively streamline headquarters. Adapting to new functions will include changes in how we manage ourselves in cyberspace.  DoD must deal with the five challenges facing our nation, across all domains – not just the traditional air, land, sea, and space, but also cyberspace, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also some vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit.  That’s why the budget increases cyber investments over the next five years, and why we should consider changes to cyber’s role in DoD’s Unified Command Plan.  Meanwhile, DoD is currently in the process of reducing our management headquarters by 25 percent – a needed step – and we’re on the road to accomplish that goal thanks to the partnership of the congressional defense committees, which once again we deeply appreciate.  We can meet these targets without combining Northern Command and Southern Command, or combining European Command and Africa Command – actions that would run contrary to why we made them separate, because of their distinct areas of emphasis and increasing demands on our forces in them.  And indeed those demands have only further increased in recent years, with each command growing busier.  So instead of combining these commands to the detriment of our friends, our allies, and in fact our own command and control capabilities, we intend to be more efficient by integrating functions like logistics, intelligence, and plans across the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and subordinate commands, eliminating redundancies while not losing capability.  Much can be done here.  Additionally, in the coming weeks the Defense Department will look to simplify and improve command and control where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy, or less efficient than they could be.  The military is based on rank hierarchy, where juniors are subordinate in rank to their seniors; this is true from the platoon to the corps level, but it gets complicated at some of our combatant and component command headquarters, where we have a deep bench of extremely talented senior leaders.  So where we see potential to be more efficient and effective, billets currently filled by four-star generals and admirals will be filled by three-stars in the future. Next is acquisition. Thirty years after the Packard Commission’s recommendations led to the establishment of an undersecretary of defense for acquisition, service acquisition executives, and the roles of program executive officers and program managers, it’s clear we still can and must do more to deliver better military capability while making better use of the taxpayers’ dollars.  One way we seek to improve in this context is by streamlining the acquisition system itself.  This will include evaluating and where appropriate reducing other members of the Defense Acquisition Board – it’s currently composed of about 35 principals and advisors, each of whom is likely to feel empowered as a gatekeeper for acquisition; reducing these layers will both free up staff time and focus decision-making energy on overcoming real obstacles to program success rather than bureaucratic hurdles.  And we also intend to reduce burdensome acquisition documentation – just for one example, in cases where the defense acquisition executive serves as the milestone decision authority, the current process dictates that 14 separate documents be coordinated within the department.  Reducing these paperwork requirements in a meaningful way, and pushing approval authority lower down when a program is on the right track, will eliminate redundant reviews and shorten review timelines – ultimately getting capabilities fielded to our troops sooner, which our service chiefs and our combatant commanders desire and deserve. The last major area where we need to update Goldwater-Nichols is in making changes to joint personnel management.  One of the hallmarks of Goldwater-Nichols is that it made joint duty required for all officers who wanted to rise to the highest levels of our military.  In so doing, it led to great advances in jointness across the military services – such that almost all our people know why, and how, we operate as a joint team – and it’s also significantly strengthened the ability of our Chairmen, our Joint Chiefs, and our Combatant Commanders to accomplish their joint responsibilities.  But as we’ve learned over the years what it takes to operate jointly, it’s become clear that we need to change the requirements for joint duty assignments, which are more narrow and rigid than they need to be.  Accordingly, we’re proposing to broaden the definition of positions for which an officer can receive joint duty credit, going beyond planning and command-and-control to include joint experience in other operational functions, such as intelligence, fires, transportation and maneuver, protection, and sustainment, including joint acquisition.  For example, while a staff officer in a combatant command would get joint duty credit, an officer in a combined air operations center coordinating with servicemembers in all different uniforms to call in airstrikes against ISIL might not.  In another case, take two cyber airmen working at a combatant command – one does cyber plans and gets joint credit, the other does cyber targeting and doesn’t.  And while a logistics planner at a combatant command doesn’t receive joint credit, their operational plans counterpart does.  So what we’re proposing will fix these discrepancies and fulfill the true purpose of Goldwater-Nichols, which was to ensure meaningful joint experience.  Additionally, we’re also proposing to shorten the amount of time required to accumulate joint duty, from three years to two years, so top personnel have more flexibility to take on command assignments and other opportunities to broaden and deepen their careers. Now, going forward, it’s important to make all these updates under the guiding principle of ‘do no harm.’  Goldwater-Nichols took four years to write, and it’s been incredibly successful over three decades – to the credit of the reforms it put in place, we are not driven today by a signal failure like Desert One.  To the contrary – I’m deeply proud of how our people have operated in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 15 years.  So we come at this from a different direction, and the updates we make now must not undo the many positive benefits that Goldwater-Nichols has had for DoD.  Instead, they must build on them. Modernizing and Simplifying the Military Healthcare System DoD greatly appreciates that Congressional leaders have said 2016 will be the year to reform our military healthcare system, TRICARE, after having passed retirement modernization reform in 2015.  As you know, DoD has proposed various ways to reform TRICARE for several years, so we look forward to working very closely with Congress in the year ahead.  The reforms reflected in the budget give beneficiaries more simplicity and choice in how they manage their healthcare, while also incentivizing the much more affordable use of military treatment facilities.  This will not only save money, but also maximize the workload and readiness of our military’s medical force, giving our doctors, nurses, medics, and corpsmen the experience they need to be effective at their mission.  Together this should generate about $548 million in FY 2017 and almost $7 billion over the FYDP that can be better spent in other ways without sacrificing the care of our people.  It’s time to get this done. Making Sure Retirement Reform Works DoD greatly appreciates being able to work closely with Congress last year in reforming the military’s retirement system.  In this year’s budget submission, we are including a few modifications to military retirement reform to help make sure those reforms work in the best possible way for the future strength and success of our military. First, continuation pay should not be an entitlement at 12 years of service, but rather a vitally important force shaping tool.  DoD should have the flexibility to determine if and when to offer this benefit so we can better retain the talent we need the most at any given time. Second, the blended retirement plan that Congress passed last year needs some modifications to avoid having adverse effects on retention – in particular, slightly raising the maximum matching contribution from 4 percent to 5 percent.  To improve retention, we also propose increasing the number of years a servicemember has to serve before matching contributions begin – so instead of beginning them at the start of their third year of service, it would be at the start of their fifth year of service, after their first reenlistment.  DoD looks forward to working with Congress to make these proposals a reality. The Right Force Structure for Current and Future Operations The budget also reflects critical decisions on force structure reforms, all of which are vital to making sure our troops have the capabilities they need for both present and future missions.  While Congress has too often rejected such reforms out of hand, our decisions this year show that when world events and operational demands require the Defense Department to change its plans, it does so.  In turn, Congress must do the same, and recognize that with a set budget and the need to invest in advanced capabilities to strengthen high-end deterrence, it’s time to seriously consider these reforms and stop tying our hands from implementing them. I mentioned earlier that we’re pushing off the A-10’s final retirement until 2022 so we can keep more aircraft that can drop smart bombs on ISIL; in addition to changing when A-10s will be retired, we’re also changing how it will happen.  As 2022 approaches, A-10s will be replaced by F-35s only on a squadron-by-squadron basis as they come online, ensuring that all units have sufficient backfill and that we retain enough aircraft needed to fight today’s conflicts. While some members of Congress may think the Navy’s phased approach for modernizing its guided missile cruisers is just a ploy to quickly retire them, that is incorrect – in fact, retiring them now or anytime soon would be a serious mistake.  Our cruisers are the best ships we have for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and given the anti-ship missiles being developed by other nations, we not only can’t afford to go without them; we also need them to be as modern and capable as possible, and for them to stay in service as long as they can.  The Navy’s plan is still smarter and more affordable than the approach laid out by Congress, saving us $3 billion over the FYDP that we’re putting to good use elsewhere in the budget.  And to make clear that this is not a ploy to quickly retire our cruisers, we will be submitting proposed legislative language that Congress can pass to hold the department to its word. Additionally, the Army is continuing to implement its Aviation Restructure Initiative in accordance with the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act as the Chief of Staff of the Army reviews the recent findings of the National Commission on the Future of the Army.  While we will revisit the Army’s aviation transfer plan when we receive the Chief of Staff of the Army’s report, the Commission’s proposal to keep four Apache battalions in the Army National Guard could cost over $2.4 billion if the Army fully equips all 20 active battalions and keeps all aircraft currently dedicated to its equipment set in South Korea.  By improving the readiness of the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and better leveraging the diverse capabilities Black Hawk helicopters bring to the table for National Guard missions – both here at home, and around the world when called upon as an operational reserve – the Army’s planned Aviation Restructure Initiative is in the best interests of both the Army as well as the taxpayers who support it. The Opportunity of Reform Regardless of how any of our proposed reforms might be initially received, DoD needs Congress to work together with us on a path forward for all of them, because there’s a real opportunity in front of us. With last fall’s budget deal, you showed that cooperation and prudent compromise for the good of our future security and strength was actually possible.  And our reform submissions on things like the A-10, commissaries, and TRICARE reflect the fact we’ve heard Congress’s concerns about past submissions, and made adjustments accordingly. If we don’t lead the way ahead together, both troops and taxpayers alike will be forced to deal with the consequences.  So let’s work together on their behalf.  VI. REQUESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE: THE IMPERATIVE OF WORKING TOGETHER Before concluding, I want to reemphasize the big picture, because this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, and we need your support for it. For a long time, DoD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts – long-term at the expense of the here-and-now.  Thankfully we were able to realize that over the last decade, correct it, and with help from Congress turn our attention to the fights we were in. The difference today is that, while such a singular focus made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won’t work for the world we live in.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges – not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both, and we have to have a budget that supports both.  That means funding a force with the right size, readiness, and capabilities to prevail in today’s conflicts while simultaneously building a force that can prevail in the future – recognizing that future force won’t exist unless we take actions today.  That’s what this budget submission was designed to do, and we need your help to do it. I thank this committee again for overwhelmingly supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget; our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, and we hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs. In this context, I have serious concerns with a proposal from one of the defense committees to underfund DoD’s overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion, and spend that money on programmatic items we didn’t request.  While I don’t expect this committee to consider such a proposal, I have to say that this approach is deeply troubling, and flawed for several reasons.  It’s gambling with warfighting money at a time of war – proposing to cut off our troops’ funding in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria in the middle of the year.  It would spend money on things that are not DoD’s highest unfunded priorities across the joint force.  It buys force structure without the money to sustain it and keep it ready, effectively creating hollow force structure, and working against our efforts to restore readiness.  It doesn’t address the much bigger strategic risk DoD faces of $100 billion in looming automatic cuts; in fact, it’s a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability that DoD needs now and desires for the future.  And it’s another road to nowhere, with uncertain chances of ever becoming law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution…exactly the kind of terrible distraction we’ve seen for years, that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.  I cannot support such maneuvers as Secretary of Defense. The budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest strategic risk we face in DoD is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically in the Congress is averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time. By working together, I am confident we can succeed, because in many ways we already have.  If we think back to those defense investments and decisions that changed the course of our nation’s and our military’s history for the better – and not just in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like jointness and the all-volunteer force – they were all able to benefit our security and our society because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations. That same support for what’s in this budget is essential today to address the security challenges we face and seize the opportunities within our grasp.  We need your support in the decisions that our senior military leaders and I are advocating for.  We need you to work with us, and not tie our hands, when it comes to pursuing smart and critical reforms.  And we need you to provide adequate, stable, predictable resources, as only you can, by coming together as you have before – including, in the coming years, to avert the return of sequestration once again.  As long as you do, I know our national security and national strength will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

"June 19, 2015","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone! You – you the Warrior Games, the participants in the Warrior Games – you’re the pinnacle of DoD adaptive sports programs – activities that have helped our men and women heal together…in mind, in body, and in soul.  Over the past year, more than 150,000 of our warrior-athletes have participated in 28 sports camps and 51 clinics, and other activities.  And over 250 warrior-athletes are with us here this week…to come together, to compete, and to inspire each other…and all of us. I’d like to thank General Dunford and all of our colleagues in the Marine Corps for hosting this year’s games here at Quantico.  And I want to extend a warm, warm welcome to our British friends and allies – to the 40 competitors and their guests and to Major General Cripwell.  It’s our privilege to welcome you and our other distinguished guests, including Senator Kaine.  Thank you, sir, for being here.  And Mrs. Thornberry, thank you…the spouse of Chairman of Thornberry of the House Armed Services Committee.  You honor us with your presence – thank you, both. I want to especially welcome the family members, the caregivers, the medical professionals, the coaches, friends, and countless others who’ve supported our warrior-athletes on their journeys to these games.  Those of you out in the risers there.  You’re among the thousands who do so nationwide…and this morning, I’d like to publicly acknowledge and thank those caregivers for your contributions.  We know, we know you do so much – the love, the encouragement, the support, and the time you’ve given is invaluable – and I’m so glad you could join us today. But we’re all here because of these incredible competitors…the warrior-athletes competing from our total force, active, guard, and reserve alike – the Army…the Navy – now’s your chance – the Navy…that’s better…the Marine Corps…the Coast Guard and the Air Force…U.S. Special Operations Command…and the British Armed Forces.  Each of you has trained for hours to prepare for this competition.  And after inspiring us with your service on duty, you continue to do so this week…on the court, around the track, and in the pool. To our British warrior-athletes friends: even though our countries are competing in these games, we know how well we work together, day in and day out, around the world.  And together we’ve met some of history’s greatest challenges, and together we will challenge each other in these Games.  We’re grateful for our continued unwavering alliance…and for the enthusiasm you bring to the Warrior Games this year. To our American competitors: over the next 11 days, we’ll cheer for you – the men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known – as you run, shoot, and swim in competition for the prized Chairman’s Cup. Each of you is a testament to the healing power of sports.  Sports provide a place to come together – to learn, to grow, and to rehabilitate.  Sports keep us going, they can fuel a sense of purpose, and they remind us that we can get back up, dust off our uniforms, and push ourselves to our limits once again. As we wait for the torch to light the Warrior Games cauldron, I can see the fire that burns within each of you – a fire to compete, that cannot be extinguished, and that inspires us.  As warrior-athletes, you’re proof that our people never give up. You inspire your fellow warriors.  You inspire me – and all who work at the Department of Defense – to do our best to protect this country and to take care of our troops and their families.  You inspire your community with your competitive spirit and your dedication to the mission.  And, you inspire our entire country to always honor those who serve and sacrifice so much on America’s behalf. So you – you, our people, are my number-one commitment as Secretary of Defense, and I’m going to make sure our commitment to taking care of you remains as strong as ever.  I want you to know that I’m immensely proud of everything you have accomplished, and everything you will accomplish…in these games, and long into the future.  And I’ll be cheering for you, and supporting you, all along the way. Thanks, and good luck!

"Aug. 4, 2014","Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased you’re here.  We’re happy you’re here.  And we’re very proud that you’re here, because this afternoon we’re going to acknowledge four rather important people for this institution – four individuals that have accumulated not only a respectable, but impressive career of doing important things, doing those things the right way, and focused on making the institution they work in, and those around them, better, better people.  So I’m very proud today to be a part of this. And we’re particularly happy that many of the family members of these four individuals are here.  These are the families of Christine, and Mike, Jess, Jamie.  So we welcome you.  And we welcome all of you who are here today who work with these four individuals.  Each of you have and have had special relationships with these four, with this institution, and with and for our country.  And we appreciate that. We welcome Christine Wormuth as our new Under Secretary for Policy. We welcome Mike McCord as our new Under Secretary for Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer. We welcome Jess Wright as our, well not exactly, new – but, very glad that you’re legitimate and you’re now Good-Housekeeping- and Senate-approved.  As you all know, Jess has been filling the role of our Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness for a long time before she was confirmed, so a particular thanks to Jess. And also to Jamie Morin, who as you all know is our new Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. Now, I realize, as we all do, that calling this a “welcoming” ceremony is a bit of a misnomer, since they’ve all been working in this building, as I noted, for many years.  However, each has assumed new roles and responsibilities that are among the highest and most challenging in this department.  And I, maybe on a bit of a parochial note, would add, I think, in the United States government, maybe in the world.  The jobs that these four individuals are assuming are big, big-time jobs, and many of you in the audience today have held those jobs very successfully, and to you, we thank you. The Department of Defense is, as you all know, undergoing a great transition.  We are seeing a world in transformation, a world that is probably building a new world order.  How all that comes out is going to very much depend on the leadership from this country, and the leadership of our most significant institutions, and this department, the Department of Defense, is certainly one of those. As we all recognize, our first responsibility is to the defense and security of this country.  To successfully navigate this time of uncertainty, we all must completely stay focused on building – as we have from the beginning of this republic – a ready, agile, capable, modern force to defend against the full spectrum of threats and challenges that we face today and into the future. We will do that by investing in three pillars of our military: our people, our capabilities, and our partnerships. In all three of these areas, DoD must meet the challenges, and probably as important as meeting the challenges is to seize the opportunities, and not squander the opportunities.  And sometimes those opportunities are hard to discern, when we are faced with as many challenges as we are today.  At this complicated and, I think we all agree, dangerous time in the world, we need leaders who are steady, who are engaged, experienced, and forward-thinking. We could easily allow our time and energy to be consumed by the crisis of the moment, of the day, the crises of the week… but we must also lay the groundwork to help define the future.  We can’t think just about where we are.  We must also think through where we’re going. Together, these four leaders represent more than 100 years of experience in the defense field.  They don’t look that old, but that’s pretty incredible.  Over 100 years of experience in this endeavor.  And like our new Deputy Secretary, Bob Work, who is here today, they are tested, tested leaders. Christine, Mike, Jess, Jamie – we thank the four of you.  We thank you again, for again stepping forward to continue to serve the men and women of this department.  We thank you for what you will do to strengthen our people, our capabilities, and our partnerships.  And we thank you for your families. We thank your families for their sacrifices, the sacrifices that you’ve made, and the sacrifices for them and on your family life, that they have had to make to support you, and you all know that better than anyone.  And we thank them for their willingness to let our country take even a bit more time from them, and the time you have with them. People in this room, in this building, across the country, and men and women deployed all over the world will be counting on the four of you.  They’ll be counting on you because their success will depend on your leadership, your guidance, and your wisdom. Over the last year and a half, I have come to know and trust each of you.  I’ve known you over the last year and a half as exceptional individuals and exceptional leaders.  The commissions you receive today reflect not only my confidence in you, but the President’s confidence in you.  And I am looking forward to continuing working with all of you to ensure that America’s military remains the best in the world, the most capable in the world, and ready for whatever challenges lie ahead. As I am about to call each of you up to present your commissions, I want to acknowledge two people here in the audience.  I see one, I’m not sure if the other one is here, but – Christine, I’m sorry – Elissa Slotkin, who is here. Elissa, for the double-, triple-, quadruple-duty that you performed for a long time, thank you.  You deserve recognition and thanks for doing all those jobs, filling in all those jobs in really a pretty spectacular and special way – Elissa Slotkin. Also, Mike Lumpkin.  I don’t know if Lumpkin is here.  He’s working, I’m sure.  But Mike Lumpkin has taken on many projects in this department since he’s come back in the last year and a half.  And I want to acknowledge Mike’s work, because he filled in a number of positions while we were awaiting the wise counsel of the Senate and their confirmation of our distinguished leaders today, so to Mike Lumpkin, wherever you are, thank you. Now if I could ask each of you to come forward, starting with Christine Wormuth.

"July 19, 2016","Deputy Secretary Work, Vice Chairman Selva, General Allyn, family and friends of Lieutenant Colonel Kettles, thank you, thank you all, for joining us today. I particularly want to welcome his wife Ann, son Michael, daughter Cathy, brother-in-law Patrick, nephew Michael. We’re so proud to have you all here. We gather today here to honor an American hero…though, like the three other Medal of Honor recipients who honor us with their presence today, he would resist the description. In fact, for nearly 50 years he stayed quiet, content to allow his remarkable story to reside mainly in the memories of fellow soldiers like Roland Sheck and Dewey Smith, who are here with him today. Thanks, Gus. And it would have stayed that way if his wife Ann hadn’t prompted him to tell the story to William Vollano, a dedicated volunteer with the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project who is helping preserve and pass on these vital stories for generations to follow. Even after some prompting, Lieutenant Colonel Kettles downplayed his role, talking up the heroism of his fellow soldiers, and the technical capabilities of the UH-1 Huey he flew in a new kind of war. And that, by the way, he still loves, flying in one a few weeks ago. Like so many of our veterans, he was content to know that he’d done his job, he’d served his country, and he’d looked out for his fellow soldier. But when this remarkable story was brought to my attention last August, I agreed that it was important to properly recognize his actions, and asked Congress to pass special legislation allowing this belated honor. And thanks to the efforts of Representative Dingell, Senators Stabenow and Peters, and Chairman Rogers, President Obama was able to present our nation’s highest military honor to Lieutenant Colonel Kettles yesterday in the White House. And today, it is our profound honor to add his name to the wall in the Hall of Heroes here in the Pentagon. But first I want to talk about a different wall, just over the river, downtown, across Potomac. There, as you all know, are over 58,000 names inscribed in black granite on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Every name represents a great loss for a family, and our nation. But as President Obama noted yesterday, because of the valor of then-Major Kettles and his crew on May 15th, 1967, there are 44 names that are not on that wall. Just think about what that means. How many Thanksgiving tables have had an extra chair through the years because of his actions? How many weddings, childbirths, and graduations were made possible because Major Kettles and his crew returned, again and again, to the hot landing zone on the Sông Trà Câu riverbed? We can only wonder. Just as we can only wonder what must have gone through Major Kettles’ mind the first time he approached the landing zone and saw an entrenched enemy in battalion force, intensely firing upon the outnumbered American troops below. But we know that in the face of all that, he landed. And we know he stayed under fire long enough to offload reinforcements and supplies, and to take on the wounded. We may never fully comprehend what must have gone through Major Kettles’ mind next as he piloted his damaged helicopter back to base, full of holes, leaking fuel. But we know that he made it, saving all on board. And then he jumped to another Huey. We can only imagine what must have gone through Major Kettles’ mind as returned to the landing zone, fully aware of what he would face. But we know that he led six helicopters in, exposed to withering fire, to exfiltrate the embattled force. And then, we can only guess what went through Major Kettles’ mind as he made the defining decision to double back yet again – this time for the eight soldiers who remained pinned down on the ground and under continuous fire. Surely he must have known that as the only aircraft returning, he would take all the fire. And he surely knew that without any air support, his odds of successfully taking off again weren’t good. But we know that in the face of those odds, he did land. We know that he retrieved the squad. And we know that despite being hit by a mortar round and machine gun fire – damaging his tail boom and his main rotor blade, and shattering both front windshields and the chin bubble – he still got into the air, and back to safety once again. No, we cannot fully know what went through the mind of Major Charles Kettles that day. But we know what motivated him. We see it in the names on the walls of this very room, we can feel what has always motivated the men and women of our military: Duty. Honor. Country. And the deeply held conviction that we will never, ever, leave a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine behind. For many American servicemembers in harm’s way, the first indication that they would see their family again was the sound of helicopter blades beating against the sky. Without the valor of the helicopter pilots in Vietnam, countless additional names would have been added to the wall across the river. And without the pilots and crews who continue the watch today – in Blackhawks, Ospreys, Chinooks, Lakotas, Pave Hawks, Super Stallions, Cobras, Apaches and more, over Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere – many more would have been lost over the past 15 years of war. Today, as we honor Lieutenant Colonel Kettles, we honor the many other pilots and crews who have taken great risks, and made great sacrifices, to support the warfighter on the ground and bring them safely home. If you were to walk from this auditorium up the stairs to my office, you’d see a large painting featuring a line from the book of Isaiah that well describes the man we honor today:  “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” the line goes. “Here am I, send me.” Lieutenant Colonel Kettles, you’ve never hesitated to answer “send me” when the call came – whether it was serving active-duty tours in Korea, Japan, and Thailand, or returning from civilian life as a citizen soldier to serve multiple tours in Vietnam, or displaying conspicuous gallantry in the face of enemy fire on the riverbed at Sông Trà Câu. On behalf of the families of the 44 men you helped save that day, on behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and on behalf of a deeply grateful nation, I congratulate you on this well-deserved honor, and I thank you for your service to the United States of America. Thank you.

"Jan. 21, 2016"," General, thank you so much for that introduction. Thank you all for being here this morning. Friends, colleagues, allies, partners, thank you. It’s an honor for me to be here with you today, particularly at this extraordinary institution, which has produced countless leaders that have not only strengthened France but also its alliance with the United States. From Lafayette to Pershing, from the Statue of Liberty to the liberation of Paris, we stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity, and we are proud, proud, to count you as America’s oldest ally.  Yesterday it was my solemn honor to place a wreath at the Place de La Republique in memory of the victims of the November attack. The savage gunmen who opened fire that day attacked us all.  It was an attack on civilization, an attack on the very freedom you in this room have dedicated your careers to protecting – the freedom of everyday people to dream their dreams, to raise their children, and to live full lives. The determination I see in your eyes today is the same determination I see in the eyes of every man and woman in this magnificent city. It is our determination as well. We must, we can, and we will deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  Hours after the attack in Paris, Minister Le Drian and I were on the phone driving our military alliance forward. The first thing we agreed was to deliver ISIL a crushing response in the heart of Raqqa. We also agreed right away to intensify our intelligence sharing and operational planning.  That week both of our nations signed a so-called “Special Instruction” to our respective military intelligence organizations, allowing thousands of additional intelligence products to be shared with one another, to improve the targeting of ISIL, and enabling closer planning between us.  The French military has been fortunate to have a steadfast and determined leader like Jean-Yves Le Drian. Over the past three and a half years, the United States and France have committed to one another in new ways to counter common challenges around the world and that simply would not have been possible without Jean-Yves, and I am proud to call him my friend. His incisive observations have played a critical role in the refinement of the coalition military campaign plan to defeat ISIL that I want to share with you today.  Many of you will play an important role in the execution of this plan on land, sea, air, and cyber-space working alongside many coalition partners. We all must have a common campaign plan that the entire coalition understands, and that our enemies cannot survive. The military actions that the United States, France, and our coalition partners have taken in recent months have allowed the campaign to gather momentum, and to apply pressure to ISIL in Iraq and Syria on more fronts than at any other point previously in the campaign. Moreover, this pressure is not only having an effect itself, it’s also generating additional opportunities to further accelerate the campaign.  As we continuously adapt and accelerate the campaign, we will intensify the pressure on ISIL, not just in Iraq and Syria, but in other regions where they have emerged, using a variety of tools at our disposal.  It won’t be easy. ISIL is a cancer that’s threatening to spread. And like all cancers, you can’t cure the disease just by cutting out the tumor. You have to eliminate it wherever it has spread, and stop it from coming back. The coalition military campaign plan that unites our efforts accordingly focuses on three military objectives: One, to destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its two power centers in Mosul and Raqqah, Two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide, and three, to protect our nations from attack.  To accomplish the first of these goals, we are enabling motivated, local forces on the ground to defeat ISIL and to sustain its defeat. We’re doing this by providing, first, a clear military campaign plan and decisive leadership by nations such as the United States and France, and second, the support of a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities – ranging from air strikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice, and assistance from those on the ground.  Last week, I described the elements of this military campaign plan firsthand to the troops of the U.S. 101st Airborne – no strangers to French history – who will soon deploy to Iraq to execute a part of this campaign. And now this week it’s my privilege to discuss it also with you, their partners. Let me map for you, as I mapped for our departing troops, where we are headed this year.  The ISIL parent tumor has two centers – Raqqah in Syria, and Mosul in Iraq. ISIL has used its control of these cities and nearby territories as a power base from which to derive considerable financial resources, manpower, and ideological outreach. They constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic, and ideological centers of gravity.  That’s why our campaign plan’s map has big arrows pointing at both Mosul and Raqqah. We will begin by collapsing ISIL’s control over both of these cities and then engage in elimination operations through other territories ISIL holds in Iraq and Syria.  Last month I visited Iraq to thank U.S. and coalition troops and to meet with Iraqi leaders. As I spoke with them, it became apparent that the additional military steps that we implemented in the fall, in fact beginning well before the Paris attack, are generating significant momentum across the battlefield in Iraq and Syria. It’s clear that our actions to accelerate the campaign are having an effect, and moreover, are creating opportunities to do even more.  Local forces trained by American, French and other troops are taking ground back from the enemy. U.S. and French pilots were the first to take to the skies over Iraq and continue to bomb ISIL relentlessly, degrading its ability to move fighters and materiel by cutting off key transit routes to, and especially between, Raqqah and Mosul.  Our strikes are dismantling ISIL’s war-sustaining finances, targeting its oil production and its industrial base. Together, we will continue these kinds of operations as part of the overall effort to degrade its financing.  Throughout Iraq and Syria we are significantly constraining ISIL’s ability either to defend or attack, and we’re working with our partners to take advantage of every opportunity this presents. For example, we now have a specialized expeditionary targeting force in place that is preparing to work with the Iraqis to begin mounting sudden, long-range raids, going after ISIL’s fighters and commanders, killing or capturing them wherever we find them, along with other key targets.  In Syria, we’re combining the effects of our air campaign with support to local forces to isolate, pressure, and eventually collapse ISIL control over its so-called capital of Raqqah.  In November, a coalition of Syrian Arabs that we helped equip in northern Syria fighting alongside Kurdish and Turkmen forces recaptured important terrain along the Turkey-Syria border. And in just the past few weeks, with our advice, these forces also captured the Tishreen Dam and surrounding villages, cutting off a critical logistics route for ISIL to Raqqah.  All these forces build momentum towards Raqqah, and as they do so other local forces can be expected to join the winning side.  To build on these efforts, our special operators are collaborating in ensuring that ISIL leaders and fighters enjoy no safe haven. Special operators, as you well know, bring a unique set of capabilities that make them force multipliers, such as intelligence gathering, targeting, and the ability to identify moderate local forces and provide them with advice and assistance, or to accompany local forces to help make them victorious.  Through even a small number of these highly trained operators, the full might of our coalition’s air power, technology, intelligence, logistics and know-how can be brought to the front end and relentlessly focused on the enemy. And while we do not discuss specifics of these operations, these forces have already established contact with new local forces that share our goals, new lines of communication to local, motivated and capable fighters, and new targets for airstrikes and strikes of all kinds. These operators have helped focus the efforts of the local, capable forces against key ISIL vulnerabilities, including their lines of communication. They’re  generating new insights that we turn into new targets, new strikes, and new opportunities.  In short, they’re generating a virtuous cycle of actions. Actions which help identify and marshal the strength of yet more local forces. Action which is leading to more intelligence. Action which is generating new tactical and operational ideas. Action which flushes ISIL out into the open, shrinking its power base, its finances and its space to maneuver. And action that sends an unmistakable message to both ISIL and the moderate Syrian opposition that our coalition will prevail in this fight.  Now ISIL must and will as I said be defeated in Syria and Iraq. The defeat must be lasting, it must stick so that similar extremism does not recur and emerge from the same places after the campaign. For the defeat to be lasting in this way it has to achieved and sustained by local forces that are motivated and capable. After ISIL is defeated these forces must secure and govern the territory by building long term trust within the populations that they liberate. We can and we will enable such local forces, but we cannot entirely substitute for them.  It’s worth noting that it was Iraqi soldiers who took back the city center of Ramadi and are fighting every day to clear the remainder of the city, proving themselves not only motivated but capable. These same Iraqi forces, supported where needed by our coalition, aim to deliver the same results to the people who have been brutalized in every town on the road to the border in Anbar and on the road north to Mosul. These devastated towns and villages need to be secured, they need to be rebuilt, and they need to be governed.  As Ramadi showed, the unmatched capabilities of our coalition can enable and multiply the power and force of our local partners. We’re clearing the battlefield with precision strikes. We’re giving them equipment, and training on how to use it, including, just to give one concrete example, the temporary bridge that helped Iraqi troops cross the Euphrates when ISIL had blown up all the bridges in the town.  We’re giving them training, advice and assistance in modern warfare, including engineering and logistics. And we’re prepared to do more where and when we can have an additional strategic effect.  The training we’re providing will be critical, as the Peshmerga approach Mosul from the north to close with the Iraqi Security Forces and Counterterrorism Service approaching from the south. Reaching and retaking Mosul will not be easy, and it will not be quick. There will be many engagements in between. Logistics will become a greater challenge as the Iraqi Security Forces move farther from Baghdad, and the need for operational support from our coalition will likely grow.  But as our success in Ramadi and north and central Iraq has shown, training, advising, and assisting rather than trying to substitute entirely for local forces is the right strategic approach. Now when we see something that works, we look for ways to do more of it whenever and wherever it can have a strategic effect as we collapse ISIL’s hold on its remaining territory in Iraq.  This campaign is not up to our two nations alone, the United States and France, to accomplish. The lasting defeat of ISIL must be a global undertaking, because it’s a global threat. And any nation, any nation, that cares about the safety of its people or the future of its civilization must know this – the United States and strong partners like France will continue to lead the fight, but there can be no free riders.  That means that as we invest in the acceleration of the campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners and every nation in a position to help. Yesterday, I met with my counterparts from six nations who share a fundamental commitment to accelerating the campaign. We met to discuss a common approach to intensifying our military efforts.  There was broad agreement on the objectives of the campaign plan among our ministers, and the need to accelerate our collective efforts. We received a briefing from Admiral Mark Fox, the Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command, on the wide range of capabilities – both military and non-military – that are needed to prosecute the campaign. We agreed that all must and can do more.  It was a very positive meeting, and it will give every minister the opportunity to discuss with their governments what else they can bring to the table, and how they can better align their efforts with our common goals and strategy. But we also recognize that there are other capabilities that our wider coalition can and must bring to the table as well. We therefore yesterday agreed to call the full coalition, all 26 nations plus Iraq, to meet next month in Brussels for the first ever meeting of defense ministers of the Counter-ISIL Coalition to further align our efforts, including the resources needed for the fight ahead.  France is already contributing greatly, as are several other nations. Many other nations can do more. And some are on the wrong track entirely.  I have personally reached out to the ministers of defense in over 40 countries around the world to ask them to contribute to enhancing the fight against ISIL – more special operations forces, more strike and reconnaissance aircraft, weapons and munitions, training assistance, as well as combat support and combat service support.  And very importantly, we also need the full involvement of every government, not just every military. That means greater diplomatic, political, and economic engagement. It means development and reconstruction. It means actions at home and abroad to disrupt, dismantle and degrade ISIL’s capabilities, recruiting and finances.  Now we don’t ask for favors, but neither do we grant favors. We recognize that nations follow their own best interests, as we follow ours. That means that they themselves must accelerate their efforts disrupting the networks that enable the flow of foreign fighters and material across their lands. That means joining and taking advantage of the opportunity to fight ISIL in Iraq and Syria, before it becomes a more serious threat to their public. And for Muslim-majority nations in particular, that means stepping forward and debunking ISIL’s false claims to religious or ideological excuses for brutality.  When the full coalition meets next month, every nation must come prepared to discuss further contributions to the fight. And I will not hesitate to engage and challenge current and prospective members of the coalition as we go forward.  There is also an opportunity for those nations who have been on the wrong side of this fight so far – Russia and Iran. They can make a difference too by stopping their unending support for Bashar Assad – a chief instigator of radicalism and terrorism in Syria – and instead support a timely political transition ending that disastrous civil war.  Next, let me describe the fight outside of Iraq and Syria. As we work to destroy the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas such as North Africa, Afghanistan, and Yemen.  The threat posed by ISIL, and groups like it, is continually evolving, changing focus and shifting location. France has been a leader in this area. I know many of you have served side by side with American troops in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere. France has taken the fight to terrorists in Mali and other nations with our support since 2013, and you’ve been working throughout the arc of instability from Syria to the Sahel for many years.  You know the dangers of violent extremism, and you’ve seen how quickly it can spread. And you know the importance of a flexible and nimble response with a broad reach in responding to these dangers.  Now in order to enhance that nimble and flexible response, the United States for our part is organizing a new way to leverage the security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe into a network to counter transnational and transregional threats like ISIL.  From the U.S. and coalition troops I visited in Morón, Spain in October, to those I visited last month in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, those regional nodes provide forward presence to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds. They enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent ISIL affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the parent tumor itself.  This counterterrorism network is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this network in action was our November 13th strike on Abu Nabil, where assets from several locations in the network converged to successfully kill this ISIL leader in Libya.  Libya will continue to be a challenge in the year to come, illustrating the new reality where small organizations wield undeserved power in chaotic places. As we discussed yesterday, a number of European nations including Italy have taken the lead to think through how Europe can support a new government in Libya, and the United States is prepared to support that effort.  Now as we destroy the parent tumor and disrupt its metastases, we are constantly mindful that the fundamental mission of our militaries – yours, as well as ours – is protecting our people at home. In addition to operations overseas, that means playing a supporting, but very strong and active role to play within our borders, reinforcing law enforcement, homeland security, cyber defense, intelligence and other aspects of the government response to terrorism.  Beyond our shores we’re using all appropriate means at our disposal to disrupt potential attacks on our homelands before they can occur. And to hold accountable those who would do us harm. After the Paris attack in November, President Obama vowed that we would help hunt down the perpetrators. And on December 24th, our airstrikes killed Charaffe al Mouadan, a Syrian-based ISIL member with a direct link to the Paris attack cell. Two days later, another ISIL leader with ties to the Paris attack, Abdul Kader Hakim, was killed. Our government promised to pursue Jihadi John, who plotted against British, American and other people, as our Vice President said “to the gates of hell.” And now he is dead. We’ve made it clear that those who threaten or incite harm to our people and our friends, wherever they are, will surely come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice.  Our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, at its source and wherever it rears its head, is far from over, but the outcome is certain. There will be extraordinary challenges ahead, and I emphasized yesterday and will emphasize again in Brussels in a few weeks time, we must all do more. But our campaign will continue to adapt and to build on our success, as ISIL’s territory decreases, its resources dwindle, and local, capable forces gain the capacity to not only win on the field of battle, but to lay the foundation for lasting security in the region, and a more secure future for the world.  Thank you once again for inviting me to address this prestigious audience, and for the strength of our oldest ally. Vive la France!

"Sept. 12, 2017","Welcome Mr. Minister, Ambassador Fezas Vital – Your Excellency, Ambassador Glass – it’s good to have our diplomats alongside us for meetings like this. Military officers, members of the delegation, welcome. Minister, it is a pleasure to see you again after meeting for the first time during the NATO Defense Ministerial in May. You and I inherit a very strong and positive relationship between our two countries. Portugal and the U.S. have enjoyed a long history of cooperation and friendship since as far back as 1790, when the U.S. sent its second-ever consular officer to Portugal. And Portugal was one of the first countries to recognize American independence in 1791. Our countries have been bound together through NATO since the alliance’s founding in 1949. We have stood together for 69 years. What does this mean to us? It means that we stand alongside each other against those who would do us harm, aware that we are strongest inside an alliance. The Pentagon’s remembrance of 9-11 yesterday alongside last month’s loss of 15 innocent lives to terrorism in Spain remind us that we’ve got to stay together. They also remind us of the need to increase our commitment to the common defense of our democracies. The security situation is changing, and we must change with it. We need to look at NATO’s southern and eastern flanks and have a shared appreciation of that situation, both in NATO talks in Brussels and beyond. Today, I look forward to a healthy discussion about further strengthening our relationship. I don’t believe relationships stay the same. I also look forward to making progress on the two percent Wales pledge and, within the NATO alliance, continuing to carry out our responsibilities to pass freedom and democracy to the younger people growing up, so they can have what we have. Minister, Your Excellency, members of the delegation, thank you for coming and making the long trip here. It is a pleasure to have you at the Pentagon.

"May 12, 2016","Hello, everyone At ease, please. You guys look magnificent. Well, thank you. Thanks for that introduction. I want to thank your Superintendent also, who I've known for a long time, Lieutenant General Johnson - a very respected leader in the Department, not just in the Air Force, but throughout the Department - your Dean, Brigadier General Armacost also, and your Commandant. You all have great leadership, I've got to tell you. Your commandant, Brigadier General Williams - all of them. I thank them for welcoming me here today.  And I want to thank all of you here today for embracing the awesome responsibility of leadership you will assume upon commissioning - leadership to accomplish the noblest thing that I believe a young person can do, which is to protect America, and also much of the rest of the world, which still depends so much on us for their security. And I like to say that security is like oxygen. When you have it, you don't think about it. But when you don't have it, it's all you can think about.  And the great gift that we give to Americans is to give them that security that allows them to get up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, live lives that are full. A lot of people around the world don't get that, but that's what we owe to our own people, and that's what you'll provide to our own people.

And there's no better feeling than being a part of that mission. You'll have that feeling. From cyberspace to outer space to the defense of the commons, the Air Force, our Air Force, benefits the human family not just in this country, but around the world; gives them security, gives them peace of mind.  And as you step forward into what is really a new and a complex world, our nation is counting on you, on your professionalism, on your pursuit of innovation, and most of all your principled leadership.

So before I get to your questions, I want to take some time to discuss the strategic landscape into which you will soon figure. And I want to convey to you briefly several of the lessons that I need and expect you to carry with you from this extraordinary institution, into the great challenges you'll confront in your career.

Now, today we in the United States and around the world face no fewer than five major immediate evolving, but immediate challenges. First, countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia- Pacific region, which will be in your lifetimes the single region of the world of most consequence for America. It's where half of humankind lives, half of the global economy, and that's only increasing. We play a pivotal role there in keeping the peace and we're going to do that and need to do that into the future, and air power is going to be critical to that. Strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's nuclear provocations. Checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Persian Gulf. And of course, accelerating the defeat, the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and then everywhere it's metastasized around the world, and all the while protecting the homeland.

Now, we don't have the luxury of choosing among all these challenges. We have to deal with them all. And they may all affect your career in some way at different times because your service will span decades.  Maybe a future Chief of Staff or a future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is in this room right now.  And history tells us that ten, twenty years from now, new challenges we don't even foresee and aren't among the ones I just named, will almost certainly arise.  So to help you prepare and succeed today, lead and thrive in an uncertain and complex future, I want to tell you about four commitments that I have that guide me every day in what I do, and that I want you to have and make also, and take with you as you leave this place. The first commitment is to ground all of your training, all of your thinking and all of your actions in our core mission of the Department of Defense: our primary obligation will always be protecting our people and serving our nation's interests. When I sit with the President in the situation room, we're always focused on America's interests because that's what matters most. Some regions of the world are exceedingly messy, but we're not daunted or confused because we have our North Star. And we also recognize that protecting American interests often means leading other nations and other peoples, and leading by example. Ever since World War II, the United States has stood as the world's foremost leader, partner and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world. It is a mantle we embraced again following the Cold War. And one that continues today to the great benefit of this nation, but also the rest of the world. The positive and enduring partnerships the United States has cultivated with other nations around the world are built on our interests. They understand that. But they can also see that it's built on our values, which most find decent, honorable and attractive. One thing I hear consistently from foreign leaders is how much they like working with you; how much they like working with the men and women of the United States military.  They want to work with you not just because you're capable and competent, and have an awesome force, but also because of the way you conduct yourselves. They can trust you. Other nations know that you'll treat them with respect; that we take their interests into account even as we pursue our own interests. And that trust creates opportunities to defend our interests. The Air Force provides the United States unprecedented global power and reach. But these are assets of greatest benefit to our nation and interests when they're applied in ways that are consistent with our values. So for example, when a natural disaster occurs on the other side of the world, and that's not the reason we have an air force, but we bring it to bear. And it's often you - it's often the United States Air Force that's first on the scene to deliver aid and demonstrate our values to the world. And I can tell you, that really creates an impression in people's minds. I hear it all the time. ""We were in trouble and you came and helped us out."" They don't forget that. Young people see it. It leaves an impression of what America is about. Also, you know, when we target our enemies, which we're doing right now as I stand here right now, as night falls over Syria and Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. As we target our enemies, which we have to do, we take utmost care to protect innocent life. And when we do that, we demonstrate our values. Whether you're flying over the skies of Syria or Iraq or standing vigilant watch with the Air Force of the Republic of Korea, or defending assets in space or cyberspace, standing with our strong, secure, reliable nuclear arsenal, the bedrock of our security, allowing people around the world to communicate, to have the opportunity to protect our interests, demonstrate our values, and be the difference our military can make in the world.  Your individual actions will be a clear reflection of our values and our leadership in the world. This next commitment, the second one, the one that's echoed through generations of the military, is that it's our people, and it's your people when you become a commander, who make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And it's our people who will ensure that the force of tomorrow, which you will command, remains as great as the force of today. That's why I'm so intent on building what I call the force of the future, because we have to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent for what is, after all, an all-volunteer force - people as fine as you - and we need to do that as generations change, technology changes, families change, and job markets change. And we can't take that for granted. That's, for example, why we're opening all combat positions to women because we want to select our force from the maximum possible population. It's about combat readiness, remember that. From the first classes of female cadets, including Brigadier General Allison Hickey and your own Superintendent, General Johnson, to the first female combat pilots, including my former special assistant, Brigadier General Jeanne Levitt, to General Lori Robinson who tomorrow will become the first woman to lead a combatant command. I'll do the change of command tomorrow morning right here. The Air Force in these officers has proven time and time again that we're strongest when we draw from the entire strength of the nation. Females, after all, make up half the population, right? It would be foolish to pass over qualified people for any reason that has no bearing on their ability to serve with excellence. Third, I want you to remember that our nation's defense rests on being able to find solutions to seemingly intractable problems. And that's only going to be more so in the future. In many situations, you're going to expect - you're going to encounter unexpected challenges. I told you. I told you what we're up to today, and that's plenty. But I also told you we don't know what waits tomorrow; that we need to be ready for that, too. In some instances you'll be confronted with life or death decisions at a moment's notice. Have the courage to accept risk and solve those problems, and the wisdom to determine when that risk becomes a gamble. You're responsible for the lives of your people in the accomplishment of your mission. Balancing these two solemn duties is one of the most difficult tasks you'll face, but you've got to succeed. That's the burden of command. When you plan, rehearse, and execute your missions, you must also be able to reevaluate the situation; reevaluate constantly; and take a new course of action when the situation demands it. And to chart a new course, you must have the confidence to be open to new ideas. At the Pentagon, I've made it a priority to encourage people at all levels to think outside what I call our five-sided box, because we are a learning organization. And people are constantly developing new ways of operating and approaching problems that we're at our best. The culture of learning you have experienced on this campus can't end with your graduation. You're warriors first, but you're also scientists, mathematicians, and much more. Every day, you crack the code in some way. We need you to continue doing so. This should be a lesson for our enemies. Never underestimate the ingenuity of American officers. It's a competitive world out there. And we need to maintain competitive advantage over our enemies. They're trying, too. They're evolving. They're adapting. They're trying to go faster. We need to be better. That's why as part of our Force of the Future initiative, we're creating more opportunities for you to work in advanced industries and tech companies for a time in the course of your careers so you can learn from other parts of our society and our economy that are very innovative, and bring that strength back into our military. And finally, I want to discuss the importance of being a leader of character. I often walk the halls of the Pentagon. And on the fourth floor outside the Department of the Air Force, there's a series of paintings depicting the resolve of American airmen who were held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam. I know some of those men. They serve as reminders of the character and resolve at the core of our mission. As you walk around campus, you, too, have similar reminders. Walk by Sijan Hall or the statue of General Risner, or the Plaza of Heroes, and you're reminded of what you are part of and what you contribute to. Character is a lesson you have to constantly learn - you're never done - And teach throughout your career. So hold onto these reminders. Find new ones. You'll find the words of George Washington you memorized as fourth-class cadet, remember that? ""It is actions,"" he said, ""not the commission that make the officer."" And that there is more expected from him than his title. That will have greater meaning to you as your careers go on. We're a great nation with great responsibilities. As we meet these responsibilities, our nation stands on the foundation of character that both you and this institution make stronger and stand for, and show to the rest of the world.  As you embark on your career of lives of service, know that your country is 100 percent behind you. I'm 1,000 percent behind you. I'm so proud of you. We know what you're putting into this, and we know what you're able to achieve. You're doing the noblest thing you can do, and I'm exceedingly proud of you. Thanks.

"Dec. 20, 2016","There you have the meaning of this ceremony and this hallway, right there in Chuck Hagel – and more about you in a moment, Chuck. Good afternoon everybody.  A lot of distinguished guests here, thank you, DoD colleagues past and present – standing room only, but worth it – members of the Vietnam War Commemoration especially.  Thank you for being here. Today’s unveiling and the government-wide’s commemoration are an important part of our commitment to honor veterans from the Vietnam era – and their families – for service, for valor, for sacrifice.  And we have a number of veterans here with us today, one of whom you just heard from.  Each of you honors us with your presence.  Thank you.  And let’s begin by giving them a round of applause. I also want to thank Mike Rhodes – Mike, thanks – and Jim Jackson for helping lead our department’s Vietnam commemoration.  Thanks to both of you. And I want to thank Chuck Hagel for joining us here today.  I’m proud to call Chuck a friend.  He’s one of modern America’s finest public servants.  From his bravery and sacrifice in Vietnam to his continued leadership in and out of elected office and here as Secretary of Defense, Chuck’s been dedicated to those who serve, to bringing home those still missing, and to making sure we remember the lessons of yesterday’s wars so we can ensure the continued excellence of today’s military and DoD. That’s one reason why we have hallway displays like the one we’re unveiling today.  As anyone who has walked these miles of Pentagon hallways can tell you, our corridor exhibitions celebrate some of our military’s finest accomplishments and many of the men and women who’ve served this country since our nation’s founding. But these exhibits have also sought to ensure we continue to remember the lessons our military has learned along the way – many hard-won, some difficult to swallow.  And as a result, these displays have not only inspired everyone who walks by them, they’ve also helped make us a better department and a stronger military. This museum-quality exhibit will do the same.  The Vietnam War Commemoration’s staff was the driving force behind it.  The Corridor Committee supported their idea; and our experts in OSD and the Services’ Historical Offices collaborated to make the exhibit a reality; and our professionals in OSD Graphics brought it to life.  I want to thank all of them for their work and commend them for a job well done. And of course, our fine and faithful tour guides will help walk – literally and figuratively – some 100,000 visitors through it each year.  And that’s in addition to the tens of thousands of us who work and walk these halls every day. Each person – whether a junior servicemember, a long-time DoD civilian employee, or a young student visiting on a school trip – will see what you’re getting the first look at today.  They’ll read the 30-year-long history of America’s engagement in the conflict in Vietnam, which extends all along the corridor. They’ll search the video index of Vietnam War Medal of Honor Recipients so they can remember the many heroes of that conflict.   And they’ll peer into the two Huey cabs right behind me, representing the MEDEVAC and “Slick” that are etched into the memories of so many. As they do, they’ll remember the dedication and sacrifice of the approximately 9 million Americans who – like Chuck and many others here – served in the Vietnam era.  They’ll see how our engagement in Vietnam evolved throughout the years, and how – as with the helicopter – DoD adapted its approach to the war to better serve the mission and our people.  And they’ll be reminded of the lessons we learned along the way – lessons about the innovative uses of capabilities like helicopters, and lessons on how our country must treat our warriors and our veterans, and the shame of how returning Vietnam veterans were treated – lessons that should continue, must continue to guide us in our work. Vietnam-era veterans and their families have helped America learn those lessons…and ensure we never forget them.  Throughout this hallway, and the ongoing commemoration of the Vietnam War and those who served, future servicemembers and civilians will continue to remember those lessons for years to come. Now, this hallway wouldn’t be possible without the original leadership of Retired Army Lieutenant General Claude Kicklighter.  Claude has dedicated over six decades of public service to this country – I’ve known him for over 30 years – and he most recently served as Jim’s predecessor, where he laid the foundation for what we’re doing today. So we would like to take a moment to recognize him for his contributions and present him with the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.  Come on up here, Claude.

"Sept. 3, 2014","[Senator] Jack [Reed], thank you.  As Jack noted, we came over to the Senate together, 1996, served on the Banking Committee together for 12 years. My first trip to Rhode Island was with Senator Reed.  We held a field hearing in Providence on housing issues, and then he treated me to some of the Italian cuisine in the state.  And I couldn’t have had a better bridge into, or introduction to, the state, the people, the cuisine, the fiber, the character of this state than with Jack Reed. I think this man embodies exactly what’s best about our country – his selflessness, his courage, and how he comes at problem solving, how he represents people.  You all know he’s a West Point graduate; he himself served in the military for many years after he graduated from West Point.  So Jack, for your continued leadership and support, and I think as was noted here a few minutes ago, he is truly one of the preeminent voices in our country on national security and will continue to be a hugely important voice as we deal with some of these great new challenges ahead. And some of these I will talk about here in my remarks this afternoon, because, as Tom said and others, this is really about innovation, these three days, and everything you all have done and everything you represent, to build on the past, build on to what has been done already, and it is historic, the accomplishments.  So Jack, thank you. To my friend Governor Chafee, Linc, thank you.  As Linc noted, we served together, the three of us at the same time in the Senate.  Linc and I sat next to each other on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years.  I always admired Linc’s ability to be able to cut through much of the fog, and often ask the questions that no one else would ask, and get to the real essence of a hearing.  I’ve always admired that about Linc Chafee, among other things, so Linc, it’s good to be back with you again.  Thanks for your continued service to our country. Sheldon Whitehouse and I served together on the Intelligence Committee for a couple years, and not often does a freshman member of the United States Senate get assigned to the Select Committee on Intelligence.  I was probably an accident, an aberration, but Sheldon Whitehouse was not.  And the leadership in the Senate knew exactly what they were doing when they asked Senator Whitehouse to serve on the Intelligence Committee in his first term, and [he] continues to make critically important contributions to our country on that committee.  And good to see you again Sheldon.  Mrs. Whitehouse, nice to see you, and thanks for everything you do and continue to do for our country. To your two Congressmen – one who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Langevin – thank you for what you do, and continue to do.  We are grateful.  I always appreciate your questions.  They are to the point and cogent.  Sometimes they put us in a delicate spot to try to answer them, but that’s your job, and I do very much appreciate your service on the Armed Services Committee.  Congressman Cicilline, thank you for your good work, and what you do.  And I know that [y]our delegation – this delegation representing Rhode Island – is as effective in the business of national security as any delegation in Washington. To Madam President, thank you for allowing me along with the governor and the speakers to come to your state.  I’ll be out before sundown.  I promise.  And to the other elected officials here, for your service and what you do, and also to our industry leaders – Jack said it, Tom said it, others – the industrial base is critical, and it has always been critical to not just the technological edge and advantage that it gives us, and these men and women that Jack Reed talked about who are in the end what is most important for all of us.  And it is the soldier and the Marine and the airman and the midshipman and the Coast Guardsman that we rely on – those men and women every day who make those sacrifices.  And we’ve got to assure them that they will always have that technological edge, no matter what the challenge. To the Southeast[ern] New England Defense Industry Alliance, thank you for doing this, for bringing everyone together.  I know many of the people represented here today and will be here the next two days from the Department of Defense are very much looking forward to this.  I know some have been introduced, some of our leaders here today.  Thank you all and please give my regards to all of your teams and the men and women who serve with you and let them know how much we do truly appreciate their service. This “Defense Innovation Day[s]” really says it all.  And I hope – I suspect, as you all do – it will assure that this will not be the first, nor last, day that you will bring people together.  And it really prioritizes as much as anything else, and share in a value-added way, how we are able to keep that edge in a world – a very evolving and dangerous world. Because, as you all know, while we’re grappling with many national security challenges – from the crisis in Ukraine, unprecedented threats and turmoil in the Middle East, uncertainty in Pakistan, change of governments in Afghanistan, to growing tensions in the South China Sea – all we are dealing with today, with this confluence coming together today, we also face a challenge of innovation. And it’s appropriate that we gather here, especially appropriate on the shores of Narragansett Bay, as an area that’s had a long history of innovation benefiting America’s national security. It was on Goat Island – not a thousand feet from this building – where, 145 years ago this month, the Navy established its first station for researching and developing experimental torpedoes. It was down the road at the budding Naval War College – which I will visit later this afternoon – where Alfred Thayer Mahan conceived, researched, and wrote his seminal work that defined strategic concepts for sea power that are still relevant today. And it was just across the bay where Rhode Islanders fabricated the Quonset huts that dotted the landscape of U.S. military bases during World War II. Today, southeastern New England has become the Silicon Valley of undersea warfare.  It’s not only that our submarines are built here.  It’s that their critical underlying technology, capabilities, and future operational concepts are developed here as well.  The close proximity and strong links between academia at the Naval War College, R&D; at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and industry at regional businesses both large and small – suppliers, design teams, engineers, manufacturers – all have created an innovation ecosystem that’s vital to supporting our national defense enterprise. It’s also a vital part of America’s defense industrial base, which is a critically important national strategic asset – one that I am determined to preserve as Secretary of Defense. The businesses that comprise our industrial base are as diverse as the troops they support… and like our armed forces, they are unrivaled around the world. Private-sector expertise helps give our military its technological edge, and helps drive the economic strength that undergirds our national power.  And the private-sector industrial base has always been there when we always needed it, and we needed it most – and we need it today. From churning out over 100,000 combat aircraft during the Second World War… to constructing the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles that continue to protect American soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan… our men and women in uniform have been able to count on American innovation, American industry.  We’ve been able to count on them to make the tools we need to win in battle and return home safely.  They can’t do their jobs without them. As we all know, our defense industrial base just didn’t suddenly appear.  Building it – and sustaining it – took time, and investment, and close partnership between the Defense Department and industry.  It still does, and it always will. For all these reasons, the health and the vitality of our defense industrial base has been a top concern for all of us at the Department of Defense.  I know it’s a top concern for President Obama.  And that concern only grew as we weathered last year’s damaging effects of sequestration. The deep, steep, and abrupt cuts of sequestration took a toll on the force by cutting into the readiness of all our troops.  But we were also mindful of the harmful impact on American industry, and the ripple effects it caused up and down the supply chain.  And while the budget agreement reached last year lessened the impact of these cuts for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, we still face the reality that sequestration is the law of the land and will return in 2016 if Congress does not change the law. This creates uncertainty for DoD, and for industry as well.  No organization, whether a government agency or a for-profit business, can plan for the future without being able to make some basic assumptions about resources. So we will continue to press Congress to lift this irresponsible cloud of uncertainty, but DoD and industry must prepare to operate in a world of shrinking budgets. What makes this especially challenging, and what makes our close partnership even more essential, is that resources for defense are declining even as the threats to our national security are becoming more sophisticated, more deadly, and more diverse. And while we face a multitude of threats and sources of instability in the world, I am greatly concerned that our military’s technological superiority is being challenged in ways we’ve never experience before. As the United States emerges from more than 13 years of grinding warfare and large-scale counterinsurgency operations, we’re seeing first-hand that the rest of the world has not stood still. Disruptive technologies and destructive weapons once solely possessed by only advanced nations, have proliferated widely, and are being sought or acquired by unsophisticated militaries and terrorist groups.  Meanwhile, China and Russia have been trying to close the technology gap by pursuing and funding long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs.  They are also developing anti-ship, anti-air, counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, and special operations capabilities that appear designed to counter traditional U.S. military advantages – in particular, our ability to project power to any region across the globe by surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies. All this suggests that we are entering an era where American dominance on the seas, in the skies, and in space – not to mention cyberspace – can no longer be taken for granted.  And while the United States currently has a decisive military and technological edge over any potential adversary, our future superiority is not a given. If we don’t take these challenges seriously, now, our military could arrive in a future combat theater facing an arsenal of advanced, disruptive technologies that thwart our technological advantages, limit our freedom of maneuver, and put American lives at risk. As Chairman Dempsey and I have said, we will not send our troops into a fair fight.  A world where our military lacks a decisive edge would be less stable, less secure for both the United States and our allies, and the consequences could ultimately be catastrophic. We must take this challenge seriously, and do everything necessary to sustain and renew our military superiority.  This will not only require active investment by both government and industry – it will require us to once again embrace a spirit of innovation and adaptability across our defense enterprise. Innovation was a key emphasis throughout DoD’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which focused not only on new technologies, but also on developing innovative ways to leverage our current capabilities.  And in the President’s budget for Fiscal Year 2015, DoD prioritized key investments in submarines, cyber, next-generation fighter and bomber aircraft, missile defense, and special operations forces – putting a premium on rapidly deployable, self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries.  Undersea capabilities that can deploy and strike with relative freedom of movement and decision will continue to be a vital part of the mix. To realistically sustain these critical investments while keeping our commitments to our people, we had to make tough but necessary choices, and tough but necessary tradeoffs.  These included reducing the overall size of the force, divesting unneeded infrastructure, phasing out aging and less capable weapons platforms, and modestly adjusting military compensation. While we hope Congress will soon realize these choices must be made – these hard choices must be made – DoD and industry cannot afford to putter into stagnation.  We must do more.  We must do better. One of the many reasons I wanted Deputy Secretary Bob Work as a partner in helping lead DoD was his thorough understanding of the operational and technological challenges facing our military.  He also has a deep knowledge of the “offset” strategies developed by national security thinkers in the 1950s and 1970s to ensure our military’s superiority – first the New Look, which prioritized nuclear deterrence, and then the Long-Range Research & [Development] Planning Program, which shaped future investments in leap-ahead capabilities like standoff precision strike, stealth, wide-area surveillance, and networked forces. As we see those advantages begin to erode, I’ve asked Bob to move forward with an initiative to develop a third, game-changing offset strategy.  As a key part of this endeavor, DoD’s Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Frank Kendall, will soon convene a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program aimed at assuring our technological edge through the next several decades. Bob and Frank will be the key drivers of DoD’s efforts in all of these areas.  They have my full confidence and my full support, and I will be personally engaged in these efforts.  Given the current budget environment, innovation will be critical.  We must be innovative not only in developing the technologies we buy, but also how we buy them, and how we use them in order to achieve our operational and strategic objectives. Although history is our guide, we are mindful that the 21st century provides new challenges.  We cannot assume – as we did in the 1950s and 70s – that the Department of Defense will be the sole source of key breakthrough technologies.  Today, a lot of groundbreaking technological change – in areas such as robotics, advanced computing, miniaturization, and 3D printing – comes from the commercial sector.  DoD must be able to assess which commercial innovations have military potential, rapidly adopt them, adapt them, and then test and refine them, including through war-gaming and demonstrations. For a third offset strategy to succeed, industry must also have the right opportunities and incentives to develop and operationalize the kind of innovative technologies that our military will need in the future.  That’s why DoD’s next round of improvements to the acquisition system, which I am previewing for the first time today, will be focused on innovation and accelerating the flow of technology to our people. As you all know – everyone in this audience – attempts at defense acquisition reform have been plentiful over the last half-century.  As the largest steward of taxpayer dollars, DoD must always strive to make every dollar count – and we must do better. We all agree that DoD needs to be smarter in what we buy and how we buy it.  We all want to reduce schedule slippages, curb cost growth, and get better performance to keep our military edge.  The question is, how do we do that?  Declining budgets won’t allow for repeating past mistakes.  We have to be creative and innovative. Frank Kendall has helped pioneer a process called Better Buying Power.  It identifies where in acquisition we can have the biggest impact, capitalize on opportunities and fix the problems, measure and evaluate how our initiatives are working, as we continue to refine them and look for more opportunities.  There have been two stages of Better Buying Power.  Given the need to maintain our technological edge under constrained budgets, I’ve asked Frank to develop a third stage, which will be formally released in the coming weeks.  Frank will provide more details when he speaks to you tomorrow. Better Buying Power 3.0 will ensure that our acquisition system helps achieve dominance through technical excellence and innovation – getting the best and most critical technology to our people, at the best cost to the taxpayer, and as quickly as possible.  It will strengthen our efforts to incentivize innovation in both industry and government – recognizing that there are barriers to innovation, but we have the power to remove many of them. Examples of new initiatives include:  These initiatives and others will strengthen our defense industrial base and help both the U.S. and our allies and partners maintain our technological edge. There will also be new initiatives focused on helping small businesses and start-ups succeed.  These firms are more than just the engine of the American economy – as you all know, many are represented here today – they help drive American discovery, creativity, and innovation.  There’s proof of that here in Rhode Island with companies like Rite Solutions, which developed a groundbreaking Command Decision Support System that gives sub commanders more situational and operational awareness.  About 20 percent of DoD acquisition dollars go to small businesses, a number that has been increasing steadily for the past few years.  When they have new ideas or create new technologies, we want to be helping, not hindering their potential for success.  Small businesses are also an example of niche areas within industry that can be particularly vulnerable when production rates decline.  Given today’s budget environment, we need to maintain the skills, the talents, the knowledge, and expertise that vulnerable firms bring to the table. Another important part of Better Buying Power 3.0 will expand DoD’s use of prototyping.  In times of reduced budgets, prototyping furthers technical advances in R&D;, it helps keep us ahead of the threat, and reduces risk by lowering lead times in the event we go forward with production.  Importantly, it also allows us to preserve design teams during any long periods between new product development programs.  This will be vital to preserving a robust, capable defense industrial base. Our acquisition improvements are not restricted to how we buy weapon systems; they also pertain to how we support and care for our people.  Last week, DoD released a request for proposals to restructure and modernize our electronic health records system, so it is capable of meeting present and future national healthcare data standards, and the quality and timely services we must provide to our veterans and service members.  It will allow DoD to do a much better job with sharing information with both the VA and private-sector health care providers.  These issues will continue to be a high priority for me. DoD will never corner the market on good ideas for improving defense acquisition.  We know that.  That’s why we’ve been reaching out to hear from everyone – industry, trade groups, think tanks, and Congress – and finding ways to work together to make the improvements we need. As you may know, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have been working this year on acquisition reform initiatives; in particular, we very much appreciate the leadership of Congressmen Mac Thornberry and Adam Smith and Senators Carl Levin and John McCain.  I appreciate the bipartisan attention they’re giving – we all are – this effort in particular, as well as their sense of urgency, which I share.  And your two members here from this Rhode Island delegation, who are here with us today, both on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, are vital to this effort as well.  And I share their belief that we must reduce duplicative, complex, and overly burdensome statutory and regulatory requirements that, while well-intentioned, have made managing an acquisitions program harder, much harder than it needs to be. Over the past several months, DoD has been working closely with Congressional leadership and Congressional leadership staff in developing a legislative proposal to streamline these requirements to focus more on principle rather than process.  Our goal is to reduce unnecessary paperwork so that acquisitions professionals can spend more time doing their most important job – getting the best equipment and best technology to our troops at the best value to our taxpayer.  We hope to submit our proposal to Congress by the end of this calendar year, and look forward to building on this collaboration as we go forward. Throughout all these efforts – ensuring a strong industrial base, sustaining our technological edge, and improving defense acquisition – we won’t always get it right, especially early on.  We recognize that.  We could easily allow our time and our energy to be consumed by the crisis of the moment, or the day, or the crisesof the week, which as we know are abundant… but we must also stay focused on laying the groundwork that will define the future.  We can’t focus only on where we are today.  We must also think through where we’re going tomorrow and why. In order to continue to maintain our technological advantage and stay on the cutting edge of technology, we must be willing to take risks in our innovation and creative thinking. We’ve seen that here again in Rhode Island, where in the lean, uncertain interwar years between World War I and World War II, thinkers and strategists at the Naval War College had the foresight to analyze whether aircraft carriers could be used more effectively than battleships.  With more than 300 simulated war games that sought to anticipate future threats, they developed the tactics and operational concepts that would establish naval aviation as an offensive force.  Their innovative work proved decisive throughout World War II, and beyond – enabling countless victories in the Pacific Theater, and shaping the doctrine that put aircraft carriers at the forefront of our military projects, and our ability to project power all over the world. Today, given the breadth and the magnitude of the challenges we face, DoD and industry – including those in this audience, particularly including those in this audience, and throughout southeastern New England – must once again all work together to harness that innovation, and apply it effectively. Though our challenges are great, and are many, so is our capacity to meet them: historical opportunities, historical capacity to meet these great challenges.  History shows us that America has always risen to this challenge, no matter how daunting, thanks to the drive and entrepreneurial spirit that is the hallmark of America’s national character.  The stakes are too high, the consequences too dire for us to stand by and let other nations challenge our dominance.  To retain our superiority in the future, our thinking and our actions must be relevant to tomorrow’s challenges.  We will not fail this historic charge. And I am grateful for the opportunity to share some of these thoughts with you today, and thank you, thank you for what you do for our country. Thank you very much.

"Nov. 1, 2016","Thanks, Cadet Reynolds – and good morning, everybody. What a beautiful, spectacular place.  Thank you.  Thanks to CCNY for letting me be here this morning.  This is an institution that was founded to educate the sons and daughters of this great city of New York, a city which has given so much to our military over the years as well. It’s been home of some of the most iconic moments in our military history.  In the months after we declared independence in 1776, we learned here for the first time to fight together as a nation, at the battles of Brooklyn and Harlem Heights and Washington Heights. And in the centuries that followed its birth, it showcased vital elements of our military power – from Civil War iron-clads and World War I and II battleships built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to the servicemembers, ships and airplanes that fill New York’s streets, seaports and skies each Fleet Week. And over the years, in moments of triumph and tragedy alike – whether at ticker-tape parades honoring generals, admirals, astronauts, and veterans, or the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 – this city has been etched into the collective heart and the collective memory of our country and those who defend it. Given this history, it’s no surprise that many New Yorkers have contributed to the security of this country – including students of CCNY, such as, Colin Powell, who was a cadet here in the Army’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, or ROTC – which celebrates its 100th birthday this year, one reason why I’m here – and Colin rose to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Bob Kahn, who co-invented the Internet while working at our Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; and also the ROTC cadets here today, from across the City University of New York, who will soon be joining the finest fighting force the world has ever known. We have that force today because of our people. More than anything else, they’re the reason why we’re the best.  But we can’t take that excellence for granted.  And as generations change, and technologies change, labor markets change, it’s my job as Secretary of Defense to build what I call our Force of the Future – to ensure we keep competing for top talent in the years ahead to build a force that’s just as excellent as the men and women serving our country around the world today.  And that’s why I’ve come to CCNY this morning. America has a lot of strengths, and our future is very bright – our economy is growing, we have world-class universities like this one, and we have the strongest military.  But another strength we have is all of the students here.  That generation is incredibly talented, diverse, it’s innovative, it’s tech-friendly – and many of you are interested in public service, whether in government, schools, non-profits, or volunteering in your community.  But one opportunity many CCNY students, some of you may not have considered, is serving our country by serving in the military – and that’s what I want to talk to you about today:  how we’re not only making military service more attractive, but also a place where you can maximize your talent and skills while doing one of the noblest things a person can do – defend our country and leave a better world for our children. Shortly after I was sworn as Secretary of Defense, I went to my old high school in Pennsylvania to outline this vision for the Force of the Future.  I told the students there how we in the Pentagon must think outside our five-sided box to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans. In the months that followed, I traveled the country, hearing from companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Boeing and more, and also from our own innovative troops and military leaders about what they’re all doing to compete for talent in 21st century, and what we can learn from them to improve our own talent management. And over the last year, we’ve done a lot. I’ve announced four different links to this Force of the Future, and that’s just the beginning – each of these are constantly being updated, and they’re our agenda for making sure that we have and continue to have the finest fighting force. I announced the first link a year ago this month, creating what I called at that time new on-ramps and new off-ramps – new on-ramps so more people outside of DoD can come in for a while and contribute to our mission, maybe just for one project, maybe just for a time.  And new off-ramps so more people who are in our military can spend some time at a leading university or a leading company, to gain skills that they can bring back into our force to make us better. The next link focused on increasing retention by supporting military families at the critical time of their life where they’ve proven their worth to us and we’ve invested heavily in them, and that’s the time in which many of them are thinking about having a family. And this may not be top-of-mind for many CCNY students yet, but you should know that the majority of our force is married and families are a big factor when our people decide whether to stick with us or not. We can’t change the fundamentals of military service, but wherever possible, we want to make it easier for our best people to stay. So we’ve expanded maternity and paternity leave, extended childcare hours on base, and we’re offering more military families the possibility of staying in the community where they’re stationed a bit longer before being reassigned in exchange for a few more years of service. A third link focused on military talent management, especially for officers and how they’re promoted. As some of you may know, our traditions and our systems go back a long way, and it’s a good thing. But because how we do this hasn’t changed much in a long time, in some ways it’s become too rigid – most importantly, for the needs of our military leaders, but also for the career aspirations of our servicemembers. So we’re making it possible to infuse some more flexibility and choice, continuing to make sure that our merit-based promotion system accounts for performance and talent as much as possible. And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future focused on civilian talent management. You may not know that while we have over 2 million servicemembers in uniform, we also have 700,000 civilians. These are people who fix our planes, build our ships, staff our wonderful scientific laboratories, and more. And not everyone will choose to serve in uniform and we have critical jobs for people as civilians – there may be some in this room who will apply for them – by directly hiring civilians on college campuses, which we’re now able to do, just made that change, without the long waits for a job offer that make it near impossible of us to be their first choice – as well as by expanding scholarship-for-service programs in science and technology fields, and more. In addition to all these links, over the last year we also opened all combat positions in all four military services to women, and we also lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers – all with the goal of being able to draw from 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force, focusing purely on a person’s willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission. And we’ve doubled down on our pledge to help our servicemembers transition to veteran status when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life, so that they can succeed in every way possible. All this is necessary to help us compete for top talent in the future, but it’s not sufficient.  Today our military and our troops are popular, and they’re widely supported by the American people – and I very much appreciate that, because I remember a time when it was different.  But because of all the success of the all-volunteer force – it is because we don’t use a draft anymore, we haven’t for 40 years – many Americans have become less familiar with us.  Indeed, in surveys and focus groups we run, almost half of young Americans tell us they have little or no knowledge about military service. And this may be related to trends we’ve been seeing recently in military recruiting, both in terms of where our recruits come from, and also where their parents served – whether their parents served. Geographically, first, our military’s recruiting pool is shrinking. More and more of our people coming from fewer and fewer states. Today, young Americans from rural areas are two times more likely to join the military than young Americans from urban areas. And 40 percent of those who join the military come from just six states, including New York. Most of our officers come from northern states, while the vast majority of our enlisted force comes from southern states.  At the moment, military recruiting tends to be most successful in the South, the Southwest, Big Sky Country, and most difficult in the Northeast.  That’s paradoxical, since the Northeast is among the regions with the highest percentage of young Americans who have the qualifications to serve.  So these geographic gaps represent an opportunity – a great opportunity for us – to draw talent from places where we haven’t been. At the same time, the military is also starting to resemble something of a family business, as those with a parent who served in uniform are almost twice as likely to join the military as those whose didn’t. Now, to be clear, that’s not necessarily a bad thing – following in the footsteps of one parent, one’s parents, or grandparents is a long and noble tradition in the military. And here, it may be happening because people are having positive experiences in the military and their kids see it as something that may be good for them, too.  And all that’s good.   But it also means that there are talented kids out there who would make great servicemembers, but they don’t have a parent showing them this opportunity. Consider that in terms of pure numbers, less than 1 percent of America’s population serves in uniform – from my generation and my parent’s generation, three-in-four [had a] family member [who had] served in the military. For your generation, it’s-one in three. So unless someone has a friend or a family member who’s serving, they are most likely to see our military in movies like American Sniper, or video games like Call of Duty, or TV commercials featuring wounded warriors or troops coming home. And while all these images are somewhat true, they’re only a slice of our military’s jobs, lives, and stories, which in reality are as impressive and as varied as the more than 2 million men and women serving in uniform today. Over the last decade or so, this has even contributed to new misconceptions and stereotypes about military life among younger Americans. For example, some tell us they think military life is incompatible with having a family, when the truth is, 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our office corps is married. These are both much greater percentages than in the population as a whole. Some people even told us they think there’s a penalty in the military for getting pregnant – that’s not only false; in fact, we now offer 12 weeks paid maternity leave for a new mother serving in uniform. Also, our polls show that young Americans today are 30 percent less likely than they were 10 years ago to think joining the military would let them earn money for college, yet the reality is the exact opposite. And that – during that very time, 10 years, the G.I. Bill has helped over 2.3 million veterans pay for college, and 120,000 have benefited from ROTC scholarships. And less than half of young Americans today – survey shows – think that the active-duty military has people like them in it, despite the fact that we have people from all walks of life in our ranks – and no matter who you are, who you love, what you look like, or where your parents came from, if you’re able and willing to serve, and meet our high standards, we give you a full and equal opportunity to do so. The bottom line is that because we too often talk about sacrifice alone, which is no small thing, we probably don’t spend enough time highlighting the opportunities that exist, and the fulfillment one has from achieving excellence and doing the service of your country. No one should gloss over the hardships or dangers of military life, but our servicemembers would be among the first to tell you how proud they feel to wear a uniform, how much they’ve learned and grown, and how it feels to wake up every morning to contribute something to bigger than yourself. If we’re going to ensure we keep recruiting top talent in future generations, we want to puncture these stereotypes and help our fellow citizens get to know today’s military for what it really is, even if they don’t have a parent, or neighbor, or coach, or a friends who served.  And in terms of where and how we recruit, we’ll be missing an opportunity if we kept fishing in only the same geographic ponds we are now. We need to seize that opportunity by fishing in more ponds, new ponds, ponds we haven’t been in in a long time. We have to draw talent from our country’s entire pool of population for our all-volunteer force. The first step is identifying the importance of this effort, and this a big reason why I came here to give this speech.  While I speak about this all the time, all the while we’re engaged around the world, protecting our country and confronting our enemies; nevertheless, I never take my eye off this.  Because if we’re going to help an entire generation better understand who we are and what we’re about, one speech isn’t enough – it requires a comprehensive effort across the department, and this is our focus. Let me take a few minute to tell you what we’re planning to do. And these are new things. We’re going to start communicating better the value of military life – telling our story in more places, more ways, and to a broader range of audiences across the country. While we plan to do through that through several different avenues, I want to tell you about a few. First, we’re going to change how we highlight our mission through advertising. There’s a long history of advertising for military service – from the century-old “I Want You” posters of Uncle Sam, to the commercials you see on primetime and network TV. These ad campaigns are meant to get potential recruits to sign up so that the military services can meet their recruiting needs; they get people in the door and help the services build a brand that sets them apart from others. Well, that’s good, but they sometimes highlight only a narrow slice of the institution and people who defend this country every day. Although the Defense Department used to advertise the value of military life as a whole, we got away from that over the last several years. In some ways, we’re a victim of our success, with so many people signing up after 9/11 and the Great Recession. Now we’re getting back into it. I mean, we’re starting to advertise the value of military life and public service again, and the service’s recruiting ads. In doing so, we’re going to reach out and talk to the American people wherever they are – which, as you know, isn’t just on TV anymore but increasingly in different places online. And we won’t just speak to potential recruits; we’re going to speak to everyone – including parents, grandparents, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors, and more who might influence a potential recruit. To truly have an effect, this has to be done in a sustained way and over a long period of time. We won’t be selling the newest phones or trying to get you signed up for the newest credit card. Ultimately, what we’re selling is service and mission – a chance to be part, as I said, of something bigger than yourself, that will not only do something good for you, but let you serve others, and then after you’ve served, go on to do something great with the rest of your life like so many of our veterans do. Now, since advertising can’t fully substitute for personal inspiration and contact, we’re also going to create a DoD Speaker’s Bureau of senior leaders and experts from across our military and Defense Department dedicated to helping educate key audiences – schools, parents, teachers, principals, coaches, career counselors, civic groups, cultural groups, youth groups, companies, and more – on the value and benefits of military and public service in support of our mission of national defense. And I’m the first speaker to sign up and I’m kicking that off right here, today. In addition, we’re going to try to better leverage our most successful outreach programs and also help – that already help people give back to America’s communities. One example is called STARBASE, where our servicemembers volunteer in local elementary schools and help inspire kids to explore and learn more about science, technology, engineering, and math. And that allows us to help them, but also allows those little kids to get to know us in a hands-on way, and we want to have more of that opportunity in both directions. Similarly, we’re also going to do some important new things to help each of the services improve their recruiting efforts, to increase our access geographically, demographically, and generationally. For example, I’ve heard from some of our recruiters that some high schools aren’t giving them the access they feel they need to be able to do their jobs. Now, the law requires schools to give our recruiters a basic level of access, and while it seems many schools are complying with that – recognizing that DoD might offer their students an exciting and impactful career – some others are putting up roadblocks. This is wrong. So as part of a new program to help recruiters, we’re going to survey them and identify where exactly they face impediments to access and what the most useful types of access actually are, so we can educate those educators who may not be complying with the law or who may be making life harder on their students and recruiters, and find a way to improve that. Our goal here is to better educate schools about our mission, and help them realize they should want to let us in, because it’d be a missed opportunity for their students if they don’t. Our services are also going to be experimenting with having their recruiters be more mobile, leveraging technologies so they can recruit across a wider geographic areas. And they’ll also review some of the benchmarks kids currently have to meet in order to join the military. When I was in Boston earlier this year, I sat down with some of our fantastic enlisted recruiters from all over the Northeast, and they told me some of the challenges they were facing with spectacular potential recruits who nevertheless also reflect the times in relation to such benchmarks as their current physical fitness, tattoos they got when they were younger, single parenthood, and the like. Now, some of these things we’ll never be able to compromise on – we’ll always have to maintain high standards.  At the same time, these benchmarks must be kept relevant for both today’s force and tomorrow’s, meaning we have to ensure that they’re not unnecessarily restrictive. So we’re going to review and update these standards as appropriate. And this brings me to another way we bring talented people into the military – in fact, right here, right now – and that’s through our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, ROTC, located on campuses around the country. Forty percent of our officers come from ROTC. It’s also a key part of helping those who may not have been exposed to us before getting to know us. This is ROTC’s 100th anniversary, and because DoD’s a learning organization, and we’re always trying to improve, it stands to reason that we should use this anniversary to examine ROTC – how can we make it even better?  And that’s what our sixth link to the Force of the Future’s all about, preparing ROTC for another 100 years of success. There’s no question that ROTC’s had its ups and downs over the last century. But today, it’s a very successful program, and CCNY is proof of that. CCNY enrolled its first Army ROTC student in 1917, 99 years ago, the first year of the program, making it one of the first programs in the whole country. And it was subsequently a mainstay ROTC school until 1971, when the Faculty Senate voted to cut ties with the military to protest the Vietnam War, as many other colleges and universities did at the time. ROTC didn’t return until after “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was repealed a few years ago, which allowed gay and lesbian Americans to serve openly. And since ROTC came back to CCNY in 2013, cadets graduating from here have gone on to assignments in exciting fields, like cyber and military intelligence, and serve in places all around the world, South Korea, Japan, Middle East. Now, we want to make sure that these detachments are able to thrive, help more people on these campuses to get to know us, and thereby help us attract talent to contribute to our mission. We plan to do this by focusing on those who participate in ROTC, and those who lead it, and on the program overall. Now, to make sure ROTC keeps attracting great participants like Cadet Reynolds, your instructors here also, we’ll be offering more graduate school scholarships – especially for law school and medical school – for students who are college seniors. We’ll also offer more two- and three-year ROTC scholarships, which will make it easier for someone who maybe didn’t know about ROTC at first, but will be able to participate nevertheless and serve if they learned about it maybe from a roommate or a teammate or a classmate once they get to campus. We’re going to sponsor more high school students interested in science, technology, engineering, and math to shadow ROTC cadets at schools that specialize in those fields, to help them open their eyes to how ROTC’s worth a try.  And to reward cadets that challenge themselves academically – for example, if they choose a more rigorous academic major or deliberately seek out harder courses – we plan to make it possible for them to get credit for that when they commission, specifically in how their service generates what we call the branching and assignment Order of Merit list, which basically means giving them a greater choice in what they’ll do in the military. Next, turning to those who instruct ROTC cadets, because so many of our officers come from ROTC units, we want them to be taught by our very best – just like you want the best professors and you all check out your evaluations on RateMyProfessor.com, we’re the same. And the thing is, often in the military, just as with teachers in our society general, generally the job of being a ROTC instructor isn’t always treated as importantly as it should be. We have educators here, I’ve been an educator myself. For instance, some officers determining their next assignment may have to choose between a ROTC instructor, or accepting a command slot that would get them promoted sooner. This can make the job less appealing to those that want to advance up the ranks, making some good officers who want to make yet more good officers unable to choose to do this. And now, that’s not always the case. My senior military assistant, Brigadier General Eric Smith – Eric, where are you? – who’s here today – right back there, Eric, my senior military assistant in the Office of the Secretary of Defense – instructed future Marine officers in the Navy ROTC program at Texas A&M. And he’ll tell you it was fantastic. So did our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford – he was a Marine Officer Instructor at Holy Cross in Massachusetts for three years – the first ever Chairman, by the way, to have ever done so. And that not only gave him critical insights into the generation of officers that he would lead in the future, but it also helped him build closer ties between us and that community. Teaching leadership on a college campus is something DoD should reward, and we need to encourage and make it easier for our best people to do so. And that’s why I’ve directed the military services to ensure that their officer promotion and selection boards appropriately value those who serve as ROTC instructors. We’re also going to set up a pipeline for officers who did ROTC themselves to give back to the program and be instructors later in their careers. Lastly, in terms of the ROTC program as a whole, we want it to be continuously improving nationwide, with units and schools across the country sharing best practices and good ideas that might work for others. Right now we don’t have a way to know which units are doing great things that others might want to consider adopting, in part because we have so many programs all over the country – more, by the way, than at the end of the Vietnam War – so we’re going to develop data-driven ways to accurately measure and assess which ROTC units are most effective in performing their mission. And we’re going to look at much more than just how many officers they commission each year, because quality and training and innovative ideas and things like reaching back into the local community and strengthening connections with the school are important, too. ROTC units that stand out the most each year will be eligible for a new reward recognizing their excellence, the Secretary of Defense ROTC Futures Award – and I challenge CCNY to be among the first to get it. Now, I want to be clear that for all we’ve done over the last year – including the plans I’ve laid out today – building the Force of the Future isn’t going to happen overnight. It’s going to be a generational effort, and this is just the beginning. Because our goal is to address challenges and seize opportunities that have arisen over years and decades, and we have to sustain and build on this over the years and decades ahead as well. I’m confident we can, because for the first time in a long time, the parts of the Pentagon that handle the health, the welfare, the readiness, and the talent management of our people across the entire lifetime of their service have a clear roadmap for where they’re going and what they’re going to do in the years ahead. And we’ll keep innovating as we learn more, do more and as society and technology change. After all, we want people to consider military and public service because when it comes to working in national security, no matter what they do, military or civilian, they’ll be better off for having been part of this incredible mission. And that’s true for all of you as well.  Whether it’s the people, the skills, or the experiences, nothing else compares to it – I guarantee it. You know, it’s been said that security is like oxygen. When you have it, you don’t think about it, but when you don’t have it, it’s all you ever think about. The men and women who serve in our military provide that security, that oxygen, not only to Americans, but to many all over the world who still depend on us for their oxygen, too. That allows millions of Americans and millions of our friends and allies to get up in the morning, and to go to work, to go to schools like CCNY, to live their lives, and dream their dreams, and give their children a better future. That is one of the noblest things a person can do, and there’s no other feeling like waking up every morning and knowing you’re contributing to that mission. While I don’t expect all of you to join us, I do ask you to give it some thought and to give encouragement when a friend, or a sibling, maybe even one day a child of yours might decide to do so. I wouldn’t even be surprised if there’s a future Secretary of Defense sitting here or somewhere on this campus at CCNY today, or a future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sitting among the ROTC cadets here. But I’m also confident that you all have something to contribute: a drive to be something – part of something bigger than yourself. And that’s where the call to service begins. And that’s the beginning of how we’ll make a better and a brighter world – together. Thank you for having me here today.

"Sept. 11, 2014","General Dempsey, thank you. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, distinguished guests, family members, survivors: We will never forget what happened on this day, at this hour, in this place – an act of terror that shook the world and took the lives of 184 Americans. Today, we remember those we lost on that day – this day – as we are surrounded by those who loved them.  We celebrate our nation’s strength and resilience, surrounded by those who embody it… and we draw inspiration from the ways in which survivors and victims’ families continue to honor their legacy. Our thoughts also turn to others whose lives were forever changed that day:  We live at a time of many complicated challenges.  But America has always faced challenges and we have always responded as a nation united in purpose, woven together in a fabric of strong character and resounding commitment to each other, and to our country. To lead our nation at such a defining time requires not only the courage and the vision to lead, but the humility that recognizes this unique privilege.  These traits are embodied in our Commander-in-Chief.

"Nov. 11, 2015","For nearly a century, this day has marked a sacred moment to remember those who have stepped forward to defend our nation and protect all that we hold dear. As I join the President at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, my thoughts will be with the veterans among us who 70 years ago fought their way up Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, or crossed the Rhine into Germany. I will think about the veterans who today can tell their grandchildren of the freezing temperatures at the Chosin Reservoir 65 years ago, or the scorching heat of the Mekong Delta 50 years ago. I will remember and honor the obligations we have to the veterans of the Gulf War, and to those who’ve performed with excellence in the past 14 years in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I will remember the more than 450,000 men and women currently deployed in every time zone and in every domain. My first commitment as Secretary of Defense is to our people. Because our men and women in uniform, and their families, are what make our nation’s military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. That’s why on this day, and every day, we should celebrate each generation by telling their stories, helping those that need it, by honoring their example, those who have done so much for our nation and our world. To our veterans – thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done for our country, and for the many ways you continue to serve your communities and your nation. You are the living embodiment of the tradition and the promise that makes our nation great today and inspires us for the future. May God bless you, and may God bless the great nation you have stepped forward to defend. ",Veterans Day Message,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/628618/veterans-day-message/
"Nov. 18, 2015","Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Good. President Knapp, where’d you go? Thank you very much for that introduction. It’s a pleasure coming here to George Washington University to be with so many current and future contributors to America’s national security. Now, Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris tell us, as our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of those acts and their families, that this tragedy also steels our reserve – resolve. We need to – and we will – deal a lasting defeat to this organization. Times like these have always inspired Americans to action. Whether it’s an attack like Pearl Harbor or 9/11, or a natural disaster that strikes on the other side of the world, it’s never been our nature to stand aside in a crisis. Whether it’s pulling on a flight suit to fight a foreign enemy, or pulling on hospital scrubs to help fight Ebola, Americans have a long history of stepping in and stepping up to contribute – contributing to making a safer and a better world. And as you sit at home or in your dorm room, watching those inhuman images unfold on your screen, I’m just guessing it’s likely that you stop and think to yourself, what can I do? How can I possibly make a difference? And today I want to offer you some answers to those questions, because one of my core commitments as Secretary of Defense is to help more of our fellow citizens make that difference in the world, and in as many ways as possible. I know not everyone wants to wear a uniform, and that’s okay – though I do want more Americans to be exposed to that possibility. And not everybody’s going to want to contribute to public service for their entire career, either – some may want to do so only for a time, or on and off over their lives. And that’s okay too. You don’t often hear these thoughts from a Secretary of Defense, but they’re critical thoughts to building what I call the force of the future – the kind of Defense Department, both military and civilian, that some of you right here today, or watching online, might in fact choose to serve with or in during your own careers. When I talk about the force of the future, I always start with one vitally important fact, and that is this: our force of today, our force today is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And we’ve been that great for a long time, going back, if you want to count that long, 240 years, to when the namesake of this very university, George Washington, launched what has arguably been the most successful startup in history: namely, the United States military. It secured freedom from an empire and sustained our union. It vanquished fascism, fought for freedom around the globe, won the Cold War, and went after the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. And it drove forward technological innovations that have benefitted not only our security, but our entire society. Think about it – helping create the Internet, GPS, and in an earlier era, spaceflight and the jet engine. In so many ways, it’s shaped all of our lives. Now of course, a lot’s changed since Washington’s time. And our military has changed, too – in recent decades, shifting from a draft to an all-volunteer force, reforming so that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines could work together more effectively, and adapting to counter terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan. And our institution has evolved, to draw strength from our entire pool of population, on a voluntary basis. Throughout all this, the one constant has been that our military’s people have always mastered change with excellence – continuing to defend our country and help make a better world. But that excellence isn’t a birthright. It’s not guaranteed. And we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century. We live in a changing and competitive world, and we have to earn that excellence again and again. Because our force of the future has to be just as great, if not even better, than our outstanding force of today. Our security depends on it. Take technology as one example of change that affects us. When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially the Defense Department. Today, much more technology is commercial. And as many of you know, the competition is global. Lots of other countries are trying to catch up with our advances, the ones we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like stealth, and cyber, and space. But as we innovate to stay ahead of those threats, we also have to make sure we keep bringing the best people to use that technology into the military and the department, because they’re our most enduring advantage – our people. Even more important than the technology. Nations like Russia and China can try to shrink the technology gap, and they sure do try, and terrorists can try to sow fear, as they did last week in Paris and Beirut, but none of them will ever match the strength and ingenuity of the American spirit if we marshal it properly. And as long as our military continues to harness the best talent America has to offer, we will always come out ahead. I’m confident of that. So I have a project that I call the Force of the Future, which is about staying the best when it comes to our people. Now I’m going to tell you about that today. The force of the future isn’t meant to address every issue in the military today regarding our people. And it’s separate from our determined focus on a host of matters of urgent importance to the force today, which I won’t be speaking about, but I’m very committed to – like sending them into danger only wisely, like caring for our wounded warriors and families of the fallen, like eliminating sexual assault in the military, like supporting our military spouses and families, and helping veterans find good jobs where they can keep making the difference. All those are critically important too, and will always be a top priority, but I’m equally committed to making sure that our force of the future will still be the best in the world – that I leave to my successor as Secretary of Defense, and his or her successor, and so forth, as fine as a force it’s my privilege to lead today. I made that commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school, in Abington, Pennsylvania, to outline my vision for the force of the future to high schoolers. And I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and market labor changes – I’m sorry, labor market changes – we in the Pentagon must think, as I put it, outside of our five-sided box, and try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans. In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, and Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century. Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms. It’s not a business. We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows everyone else – all of you and your parents and your friends and your fellow citizens – to go to school, go to work, to live your lives, to dream your dreams, and to give the next generation a better future. The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. So with that in mind, let me tell you here today about the first link we’re building in the force of the future, which is intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent. And for starters, let’s take people – maybe some of you right here – who aren’t now involved with DoD at all, but think you might want to give it a try. Let’s start with you first. For you, we’re going to create what we call on-ramps to make it easier to contribute to our mission. This is important, because today less than 1 percent of our population serves in uniform, which means fewer people are connected to those who do. For my generation and my parents’ generation, 3-in-4 had a family member who served in the military; for your generation, it’s only 1-in-3. And this trend is likely to continue, so we want to provide more opportunities for those outside DoD to get to know us and to contribute to our mission, even if only for a time. And it starts with what we’re doing for students like you, to improve and enhance our internship programs. With more young Americans pursuing internships today – including 9-out-of-10 GW graduates – this is imperative for attracting civilian talent. That’s why we’re making our internship programs better managed, and also more effective at transitioning promising and successful interns into permanent employees – so that if you’re an intern with us and do great work, we can do better at connecting you with job openings. We offer internships in all sorts of areas – at our Army and Air Force research labs, for example, and also at the Pentagon. If you want to apply or learn more, you can – go to the Defense Department’s LinkedIn page; to get there fast, defense.gov/LinkedIn. And since many college students don’t even realize what kinds of civilian job opportunities we have to offer, we’re going to do better at getting the word out on campuses, too. We’re also going to be bringing in more of America’s best and most innovative talent in their fields – because when you consider doing something with DoD, I want you to think of it as a place where America’s top talent comes to work. That’s why we’re creating the Defense Digital Service, a new thing, which will bring in talent from America’s technology community to work for a specific time, or for a specific project, to apply a more innovative and agile approach to solving our most complex problems. It will be led by Chris Lynch – Chris is here today – Chris Lynch, a serial entrepreneur in the tech world. And Chris is not only sitting in the audience – where are you Chris? Stand up. It’s also his first day on the job. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Look, he just flew out from the West Coast yesterday – and he’s in uniform. The hoodie, the whole deal, right? So welcome to the team, Chris. Also, to make sure we benefit from innovative entrepreneurs who aren’t technologists but have advanced skills of other kinds, we’re going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on some of our most challenging projects just for a year or two at a time. And we’re also going to hire a chief recruiting officer, who’ll serve as a headhunter to help bring in some of America’s best qualified executives for stints in top civilian leadership roles in the department. DoD has been a place where top executives like Dave Packard, the founder of HP – the P in HP, that’s Dave Packard – came to serve for a time, and while today, former military officers run some of America’s largest companies – like Johnson & Johnson, FedEx, Verizon – we want to be able to benefit from doing that the other way around, too. And hopefully that infusion of innovative, entrepreneurial, managerially excellent spirit will rub off on us. Now in addition to on-ramps for people coming into DoD, we’re also going to create short-term off-ramps for those already serving, so that they can connect with ideas and innovators outside of the Pentagon. Because we want to make it easier for more of our people to gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives – whether in the private sector, in academia, or elsewhere – experiences that they can bring back into the military to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking in that force of the future. And there’s added value in that offering those kinds of opportunities will make us more attractive to future generations, too. It might surprise you that we’re actually pretty good at offering a variety of experiences already. Some of you might think of the military as a career path that’s like an escalator – or the civil service as a career path that’s like an escalator – where you have to get in at the bottom and wait your turn before being taking up and able to get more responsibility or try something new. But that’s not entirely the case. In fact, there’s a young woman who works at the Pentagon, a lieutenant, who’s been to more countries than the number of years she’s been alive. No other job lets you have that, so many diverse experiences. And we also send our people to top-notch graduate programs, like civil engineering at M.I.T., medical school at Stanford, business school at Syracuse, and the Kennedy School at Harvard. But to make ourselves even better at this, we’re going to expand our fellowships and sabbatical programs so more of our servicemembers can spend time in America’s top industrial, governmental, and academic institutions, and bring back what they learned to keep us on the cutting edge. One of these is the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship. And some of this year’s fellows are here today, like Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Vasilios Pappas, who I don’t believe is in uniform today – Vasilios, stand up – who’s at the cloud computing company EMC, and Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Clint ZumBrunnen, who’s at the consulting company Accenture. One fellow – thanks, guys. We’re proud of them. One fellow, who – that is, SecDef Fellow, Secretary of Defense Fellow – who couldn’t be here today – but she really wanted to be, she just couldn’t be – is Army Lieutenant Colonel Maria Schneider. She’s an acquisition professional who’s embedded at Amazon, and along with finding new ways DoD can partner with that company, one thing she’s learning also is how they collect, analyze, and leverage metrics. And like other fellows this year, who are at companies ranging from Intel to SpaceX, she’ll put that and so much more into practice when she returns to DoD next year. We’ve also got some alumni here too, like Navy Captain Michael Abreu – Michael is here, Michael? – who did his fellowship at Google and now manages the Navy’s largest IT program. By the way, it’s a pretty big IT program. Another former fellow – one who will be with me in the Pentagon tomorrow, when our highest leaders all meet – is Air Force four-star – four-star – General Darren McDew. He was at Sun Microsystems, and now serves in one of the top positions in our military chain-of-command. I want more people to have these kinds of broadening opportunities – to be able to get off the escalator for a time, and then get back on – without hurting their career, but instead helping it, which after all makes sense. So we’re going to expand this program by doubling the size of it, by opening it up to qualified senior enlisted leaders, and by offering not just tours in industry, but also elsewhere in government, including state and local government, because they work on important problems too. Another program is our Career Intermission Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family. There’s a young Navy couple that did this just a few years ago. They were both aviators, flying F-18 fighter jets off aircraft carriers, but they found it difficult to reconcile their desire to start a family and go to grad school with their desire to keep serving in the fleet. They both considered leaving active duty and finding other ways to serve – effectively turning in their wings, which was a hard decision for each of them. But then they heard about this program. And they both not only used it, but their gain became our benefit too. He got an MBA from Dartmouth, and after another flying tour, he’s now a top aide to the Secretary of the Navy. She got a Master’s in Public Administration from Harvard’s Kennedy School, and will soon be working in the Navy’s public affairs office. And they were able to have two children, too. Their story is clearly a success. Didn’t come easy. Because this was a new, experimental program, lots of people discouraged them from trying it, saying it might hurt their path to promotion – even though since then, it’s only helped them, and because of that, their desire to keep serving has only intensified. And that’s good for us. They’re proof that you don’t have to choose between getting ahead in the military and getting a valuable experience that will help you get ahead in life. That is and always should be a false choice. That’s why we intend to work with Congress to make this program permanent. In addition to these changes, we’re also updating and modernizing our retirement benefits. Now that’s probably not something most of you are thinking about yet, but it’s really a big deal for us – and it’s critical to making sure people like you can give the military a try and still get, and take with you, the benefits you earned. Right now our troops have to serve 20 years before getting any retirement benefits, but 80 percent don’t serve that long, which means they leave with no retirement benefits at all. But we’re changing that, and starting in the next few years, we’ll be able to offer a portable, it’s a 401k-like plan, which all who serve can take with them whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life for them. And for everyone’s benefit – those outside the department, those inside the department; whether you’re already serving or might serve – we’re also going to use 21st century data and technology approaches to improve and modernize how we manage our talent. We put a lot of effort into staying on the cutting edge with weapons technology, and it’s time we did the same, which we haven’t been doing, in how we manage our people – giving them more transparency and choice in their jobs, and also making sure we’re getting the absolute most we can out of the remarkable talent we already have – always balanced with our needs, of course. For our military personnel, we’re going to launch LinkedIn-style pilot programs that help match-up servicemembers looking for their next assignment with units who are looking for qualified people to fill an opening. Think of a soldier logging on, setting up a profile, seeing what they’re qualified for, and selecting what they want to do, while the unit looking to bring someone on sees the profiles that fit their criteria, and chooses who they’re interested in. And when there’s a match, they’d get connected. You may have heard of some apps that perform a similar function. The Army’s already tested this with some of its engineering officers, and it was very well received. So we’re going to pilot this across the services, and eventually scale it up for everyone. It makes a lot of sense. Should have happened a long time ago. But we’re also going to improve our data-crunching and how we leverage big data to inform our personnel policies. We don’t do that very well right now. So we’re going to bring in some top data scientists to help fix that. And much like how companies use algorithms and predictive analytics to suggest movies on Netflix, or show you what’s trending on Twitter or Facebook, this Office of People Analytics, which we call it, will use similar data-intensive tools and technologies to help measure and chart how servicemembers and civilians are doing every day in all aspects of their job. And that’s going to fill some gaping holes in our data, starting with exit surveys that ask people who decide to leave why they did so; that way, we can make changes to keep our best. For some reason we’ve never comprehensively done that before. While there have been studies, articles, and entire books written about how the military is ‘bleeding talent,’ most of these are anecdotal. And because DoD hasn’t been gathering the data, we couldn’t quantitatively prove or disprove that, let alone fix it. So while it’s much overdue, this change will make a big difference in how we manage talent going forward. Meanwhile, in terms of recruiting, we’re going to look at ways we can evaluate recruit performance and improve our outcomes – including by potentially rewarding recruiters for bringing in high-performers, so it’s not just about making sure we’re meeting our numbers, but also that we’re bringing in the best. We also want to make sure we strive to recruit from the broadest possible pool of talent. If we don’t, we risk becoming isolated and insular, and that’s not the path to success in today’s security environment. That’s why I want everyone who’s willing and able to serve their country to have the full and equal opportunity to do so. I want everyone in this audience to view the Defense Department as a place where you could see yourselves making a contribution in the course of your careers, and also being treated with the dignity and the respect you deserve. Our military’s openness to diversity and inclusion is one of the things that has allowed us to bring in America’s best talent and be the best in the world over time. We have to maintain that strength. Young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, and open, and tolerant, too. That’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. In some ways, by the way, this is one area where we’re actually ahead of the private sector. Right now, DoD has a higher percentage of senior women leaders, for example, than America’s most profitable companies do. And a few years ago, we repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country openly and proudly. But as I’ve said before, we’ve got to do better. That’s why I recently announced we’re supporting the LinkedIn Circles that have – sorry, the Lean-In Circles – if you’re familiar with the book Lean In, by my good friend, very admired friend Sheryl Sandberg, of Facebook, the COO – those Lean-In Circles have cropped up across the department, and it’s why also we’re reevaluating our transgender policy, and why we’ve been opening up ground combat positions to women. And we intend to do more in the months to come. In the meantime, because diversity is about much more than race and gender, we’re also going to look closely at the geographic and familial diversity of our incoming personnel. This is important, because it’s well-understood that creating the all-volunteer force has led to a smaller proportion of Americans who serve in uniform. While that’s understood, it’s less understood that our recruiting pool is also shrinking geographically, with more and more of our people coming from fewer and fewer states. At the same time, the military is starting to resemble something of a family business, with a willingness to sign up increasingly found disproportionately in those who have a parent, or a close relative, who served. That’s not necessarily a bad thing – following in the footsteps of one’s parents and grandparents is a long and noble tradition in the military. But it could also be a sign of, or lead to, our military’s insularity from the rest of society. It might show that we need to do better at exposing our opportunities to kids that don’t have a parent or a neighbor or a coach who served. And for us to make informed decisions about recruiting our force of the future, we as an institution need to understand both these phenomena a lot better. Also, building the force of the future means DoD has to be more efficient in spending taxpayer dollars, so we don’t – so we spend every dollar where it can do the most good. That’s why we’re going to make some organizational changes to help implement these initiatives effectively, and to make sure they not only work in concert as intended, but are also continuously improved. And that’s also why, for everything I’m announcing today, we intend to figure out how to pay for it using money that’s already in our budget. That won’t always be possible, but it has to be what we strive for. In addition to making sure we keep bringing in the best people, we’re doing a lot more, I want to tell you, to be ready for the future. We’re building and rebuilding bridges with America’s technology community – opening up a DoD innovation hub in Silicon Valley, and others around the country, reaching out to the start-up community, as well as to some of America’s greatest leading businesses. We’re pushing the envelope with research into new technologies and innovative ways to apply them – in areas like robotics, cyber defense, biotech, human-machine combinations, hypersonic engines that can fly over five times the speed of sound. We’re coming up with new strategic approaches to preventing and winning conflicts against 21st century threats. And we’re pushing as many people in the Pentagon as possible to keep thinking outside the five-sided box. While all these changes I’ve described today are exciting and important, they’re just the beginning. So stay tuned in the coming months. For example, we’re taking a serious look at making some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system. We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions. And we’re figuring out how we can do an even better job of meeting our commitments to the health and well-being of our people and their families in the 21st century. The progress we’re making is a credit to the teams led by some of –where are you, Brad? That is DoD’s acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Brad Carson, right over there. And Brad has been the person who spearheaded – and I just wanted to shout, you know, give a shout out – he’s our senior official on this. Very forward guy. Making history and we couldn’t have done it without you, Brad. See, if I want to keep him, I need to give him credit, because – he’s really good, so I think I’ll keep him. After putting together a package of bold proposals, which is exactly what I asked them to do – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and making up some new ideas – they’ve been working with and through our armed services, our Deputy Secretary, our Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to closely analyze each one. And I know Brad and some members of his team are here with Brad today – and I want to thank all of you, all of you, for the hard work you’ve done. They’re an example of how a small group of people who are smart and dedicated can make a big difference. What they’re doing will be felt for years and years to come, and for the benefit of this country, but for all those who we help to defend. So there’s much more still to come, and a lot of hard work still ahead. I’ll be making more announcements in due course, though obviously we’re going to take the time to get them right – but as you can tell, we’re working hard, we’re thinking hard. And I look forward to working with everyone in the Defense Department, and in Congress, and across our government to help me do that. As we pursue these initiatives – maintaining the essential character that’s always made our military strong, while also taking steps to remain just as strong, if not stronger, long into the future – we will be guided by the words of our military’s first commander-in-chief, the namesake of this great university. George Washington once said that “to be prepared for war, is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.” Those words are etched into the walls outside the Pentagon, and they are, and always will be, the rationale for why we need a force of the future. Not because we seek to make war, but rather because we must preserve peace – today, tomorrow, and for many years to come. And if you want to help us preserve that peace, and secure that peace, and where necessary fight for that peace, we want to give you an opportunity to do so – even if you never thought about it until now, right now. I myself, I have to say, didn’t think much about national security when I was your age. I was focused on physics, history, sports, things like that. That changed a few years later, when I heard a speech about the future of technology in the military. It helped me realize that I could make a contribution to defending this country and being part of something bigger than myself. As it turned out, that speaker was a man named Bill Perry, who later became my mentor, my friend, and Secretary of Defense. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a future Secretary of Defense sitting down there among you today. I’m 100 percent confident that you all have something to contribute: the drive to be part of something bigger than yourselves. That’s where the call to service begins. And that’s the beginning of how, together, we can make a better and a brighter world. And I hope you’ll join me. Thanks so much.

"June 20, 2016","Good morning, everyone.  It’s great to see you all here, and so many long-time friends and colleagues I saw on the list to be here. Thank you, Richard, I appreciate that. Thank you for that kind introduction and for inviting me to speak here today.  Michèle Flournoy is also here.  Michèle, thank you for your years of dedicated service, for your years – dare I say – 30 years of friendship, and for your leadership at CNAS. For almost a decade now, CNAS has been an engine for the ideas and talent that have shaped American foreign and defense policy…and our department in particular.  In meeting after meeting, on issue after issue, I work with members of the vast network CNAS alumni – including my excellent Deputy Bob Work.  And I want to thank everyone at CNAS for all you’re doing to think and write about new ways to advance America’s security and make a better world. Now, I know today’s conference is focused on the upcoming Washington transition.  And I want to be clear up front that I’m not going to talk about that subject.  And the reason for that is that the United States has a longstanding practice, tradition, and principle that our department, our military, and our security leaders stand apart from the electoral process.  So I’m extremely careful not to comment on the election…except to simply say that our department will run a smooth and orderly transition, as it has always done. Instead, I want to talk with you this morning about the broader strategic transition occurring in the world today, and what the Defense Department is doing to meet its challenges and to seize its opportunities. Today’s security environment is dramatically different from that of the last generation, and even the generation before that.  In this new era, we face no fewer than five immediate and evolving challenges: Last week’s tragic shooting in Orlando underscores the urgency of that last one.  It reminds us that ISIL not only tyrannizes the populations where it arose in Iraq and Syria, but it also wants to spread its evil ideology…and to plot or inspire attacks on Americans, including here at home.  And Orlando further steels our resolve to carry out all aspects of our coalition military campaign plan: first, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, which is necessary, but not sufficient; because second, combatting ISIL’s metastases worldwide wherever it appears; and third helping protect the homeland. Now, we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these five different challenges; we must and will address them all, across the spectrum of conflict. In addition, we must grow more flexible and agile because – as much information as the Defense Department has, and as smart as CNAS experts and studies are  – history has shown us we never perfectly predict the strategic future.  So we have to be ready to contend with a complex and uncertain future where new and currently unforeseen challenges may arise. In the face of those five challenges and that uncertain future, the Defense Department is taking steps to remain the most powerful military on earth.  It’s a competitive world out there, and organizations that succeed in a competitive world do so because they’re open to change.  Accordingly, I’ve challenged the Pentagon, as has been said, to think outside our five-sided box.  So we’re changing how we invest and how we innovate, how we plan and how we fight, how we recruit and retain personnel, how our department is structured and functions, and how we work with our partners and allies – all for the better. Because we’re doing so and thanks to this nation’s enduring strengths, I’m confident that the United States will…maintain our unrivaled military strength for decades and remain the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe. But that strength does require new investments on our part, new posture and presence in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  The directions set in our 2017 budget ensure the Defense Department maintains our dominance in each domain – not only sea, air, and land, but also in cyber, electronic-warfare, space, nuclear deterrence, and more. In our Navy, we’re growing not just the number of ships but also their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships.  And we’re extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in undersea drones, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  We’re investing to continue our air superiority and global reach through innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, swarming microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts, among other third offset investments.  We’re also prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re reversing decades of underinvestment in our nuclear deterrent, a bedrock necessity, in accordance with the President’s Nuclear Review and Guidance and the modernization plans built into our budget.  And we’re also doing more to help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space. The Defense Department maintains its world-leading capabilities because it has made incomparable investments in our military edge over the course of decades.  As a result, it will take decades or more for anyone to build the kind of comprehensive military capability the United States possesses.  This strength is not simply about current and cumulative dollar figures.  Our military edge has been strengthened and honed in hard-earned operational experience over the past 15 years.  No other military possesses this kind of skill and agility backed by this much experience. Now, the responsibility I have to all my successors is to ensure that the military – and the Defense Department – they inherit is just as strong and just as excellent, if not more so, than the one I have the privilege of leading today.  To do so, we’re also seizing other opportunities for the future. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology – to stay ahead of future threats.  Overall, our budget invests nearly $72 billion in R&D for next year.  For a little context, that’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D last year combined. As part of that, we’re reaching out to America’s wonderful innovative ecosystems, which are another great and unrivaled source of national strength, to build bridges to, partner with, and inspire those innovators who want to make a difference in our world.  And this is one way they can do it.  We’ve embarked on initiatives like our start-up in Silicon Valley, the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx, and there are more to come.  We’ve also created the new Defense Digital Service, which brings in coders from companies like Google, Palantir, and Shopify for a “tour of duty,” to help solve technological challenges across the department.  And we’ve established a Defense Innovation Board chaired by Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt to advise the Secretary of Defense on how we can continue to change to be more competitive. Meanwhile, to prepare ourselves for the future we are also updating our core contingency plans with innovative operational concepts.  We’ve revised every one of our war plans.  Now I can’t tell you how exactly they’ve changed – if any audience can appreciate why I think the CNAS audience can – but rest assured, they’re up-to-date. It’s also why we’ve taken a series of bold steps in personnel and talent management to build what I call the Force of the Future…and we’re going to be doing even more.  As we all know, generations change, technologies change, labor markets change.  That’s why one of my responsibilities is to make sure that amidst all this change, the Defense Department continues to recruit, develop, and retain the most talented men and women America has to offer so that tomorrow’s force is as fine as today’s.  Later this week, I’ll visit members of today’s force – including wounded warrior-athletes at the Warrior Games.  And I’ll also meet some of the Force of the Future…ROTC cadets at their capstone summer course at Fort Knox, sailors at basic training at Great Lakes, and new recruits at one of our military entry stations in Chicago. And last but not least, seizing opportunities for the future is why we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the defense enterprise:  because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible.  So we’re improving acquisition, further reducing overhead, and proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization.  More on one of those specific reforms later. All of these efforts – these new capabilities and investments, new innovations and plans, people and reforms – will ensure that the United States military continues to defend our nation, underwrite global security, and uphold the principled order that has benefited our nation and so many others. Thankfully, we’ve never had to do so alone.  That’s because there is another critical ingredient to U.S. strength and leadership, and that’s what I want to emphasize today: our unrivaled relationships with other countries…a long-time network of allies and partners in every corner of the world. That network is an important strategic asset.  Our allies around the world have stood with us – and fought with us – time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL.  And we’re just as committed to them.  As history has shown, we have fought with our friends and allies – and to defend the principles we share – in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and in Europe. Today, therefore, America’s unrivaled military strength and that network of friends and allies – also unrivaled – have formed the bedrock of global security…and have for decades.  It reflects an important fact: the United States has all the friends around the world, and our antagonists have few or none.  That’s no accident. We have the friends because our network has long been a principled one, based on the standards and ideals the United States and these other peoples have collectively promoted and upheld for decades – like resolving disputes peacefully, ensuring countries can make their own security and economic choices free from coercion and intimidation, and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law.  It’s also inclusive and voluntary, since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute. And we have all the friends because our men and women – the finest fighting force the world has ever known – embody those principles.  Our people are not only competent, they’re respectful of other people and shared principles.  Defense leaders everywhere I go tell me they like working with our military.  That’s because our servicemembers don’t intimidate, coerce, or exclude…they work with our allies and partners to ensure a better world.  That reputation makes me proud. But as the world changes, and as more partners want to contribute, we’re taking the opportunity to adapt and expand our security relationships – and I like to say, to network them.  And in the remainder of my remarks I want to focus in on how the Defense Department is networking with our various allies and partners around the world – across the Asia-Pacific, in the Middle East and North Africa, and in Europe. Networking, of course, is helping solve challenges in many aspects of life today.  Networks of all kinds – physical, virtual, and social – have – with link after link and strand upon strand  – improved how we work and govern, how we sell and shop, how we live and learn.  And as the world’s businesses, governments, and other institutions become more interconnected, it’s in tune with the times that the world’s militaries would do the same. Networking security – whether in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa, or Europe – enables militaries to take coordinated action to deter conflict, protect their people, and meet transnational challenges, like terrorism; to ensure the security of and equal access to the global and regional commons, including vital waterways; and to provide humanitarian assistance during refugee crises and respond to disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes. Now, security networking does differ from region to region.  And that makes sense, because each has its own unique history, geography, politics, and security needs.  That’s why, in the Asia-Pacific, we’re weaving together bilateral, trilateral, and multilateral relationships into a larger, region-wide network, all in a part of the world that’s never had a region-wide formal security structure.  In the Middle East and North Africa, we’re leading coalitions and networks to address key security challenges like ISIL and other terror groups, and to counter Iran’s malign influence.  And in Europe, we’re leveraging an existing and strong multilateral network, and adapting it do new things in new ways…to stand up to Russian aggression from the east, and to address challenges on Europe’s southern flank, like the refugees crisis and the flow of foreign fighters. In a moment, I’ll address these three regions in greater detail.  But first it’s also important to be mindful that some aspects of our approach cut across all three. In each region, the basic principle is the same: we’re bringing together like-minded partners to enhance cooperation and build and strengthen connections.  And in each region, the network needs a networker: a nation and a military to enable it.  So even as we respond to the five very different challenges we face today – again, from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism, especially ISIL – the Defense Department is also leading to forge these networks. All the changes at the Department will ensure we continue to have the dominant people, platforms, payloads, and plans to provide the unique leadership, capabilities, and guidance to catalyze greater security networking across these regions.  Indeed, in region after region, our people and Department are building and strengthening connections with countries and militaries so we can all plan together, exercise and train together, and as necessary fight together, more effectively and efficiently than ever before. Those connections take many forms.  For one, we’re sharing information, including intelligence, in new ways, to allow our militaries to communicate better and in real time so that we can work together seamlessly and quickly. We’ve done this, for example, with France in the wake of the Paris attacks last November, and in the trilateral arrangement we’ve developed between Japan, Republic of Korea, and the United States, to name another. Also, more and more, we’re leveraging persistent rotational forces that allow us to project presence without the requirements of permanent footprints.  This has in turn helped us grow the number and complexity of combined exercises, like the recently completed BALTOPS exercise with NATO, Finland, and Sweden; the just concluded MALABAR exercise with the United States, India, and Japan; and the soon to commence 27-nation RIMPAC maritime exercise in the Asia-Pacific. And, as some of those exercises demonstrate, we’re also improving our interoperability, to ensure that our militaries can work with and off of the same platforms.  For example, the new F-35 stealth jet fighter will be flown not only by American airmen and naval aviators, but also by Israeli, Italian, and Korean pilots, to name just a few.  In fact, my Israeli counterpart traveled to the United States this week for a rollout of the first two F-35Is. Even with these commonalities, our approach to networking is different, depending upon the region, as I noted.  Let me first start with the Asia-Pacific. Earlier this month, I was at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where we’re continuing to develop the Asia-Pacific security network.  Security in the Asia-Pacific, as I said, has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure comparable to NATO in Europe.  Instead it has been the United States and the region’s strong but largely separate bilateral relationships that have helped ensure security and stability for more than 70 years. That’s enabled countries throughout the region to make incredible economic and human progress. Think about it – economic miracle after economic miracle has occurred there:  first Japan, then Taiwan, then South Korea, and Southeast Asia, rose and prospered.  Now, today, China and India are doing the same.  We want that positive trend to continue because it’s been beneficial for the region and its people as well as to the U.S. economy and our interests. Thanks to the investments and planning we’re undertaking as part of President Obama’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, the United States will have the people, platforms, and posture to remain the most powerful military and main underwriter of security in the region for decades.  The U.S. role is in service of a principled and inclusive network…a network in tune not only with the times but also the region’s history.  The network is principled because it stands for, and in defense of, the principles our countries have collectively promoted and upheld for decades, such as the freedom of navigation and overflight.  And it’s inclusive because the network’s aimed at no nation and excludes no one. To begin with, our historic bilateral relationships are modernizing and expanding.  While we would need to be here all day to go through the breadth and depth of this work, you can see some of the results: And you can see our relationships growing in number and strength: Those are just a few of our strong partnerships…the list could go on and on.  These growing relationships demonstrate that nations across the Asia-Pacific are committed to doing more to promote continued regional security and prosperity.  And they show that the United States is using its unique capabilities, experience, and influence to stand with them and network them to meet common challenges and ensure continued regional security and stability. For example, we’re implementing our Maritime Security Initiative, which represents an initial $425-million-dollar, five-year, American commitment to establish a regional maritime security network in Southeast Asia.  More than simply providing money or hardware, this Initiative helps the United States to enable the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to connect and work with each other – and us – so they can all see more, share more, and do more to ensure maritime security throughout the vital waters of Southeast Asia. This initiative, which has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, catalyzes a principled and inclusive security network in the vital field of maritime security. In addition to all this, the Asia-Pacific security network is coming together in three additional ways. First, some pioneering trilateral mechanisms are bringing together like-minded allies and partners to maximize individual contributions and connect nations that previously worked together only bilaterally.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral partnership helps us coordinate responses to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations.  And our three nations will conduct a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise later this month. And through joint activities like the MALABAR Exercise, the U.S.-Japan-India trilateral relationship is starting to provide real, practical security cooperation that spans the entire region from the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific. Second – and beyond relationships involving the United States – many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own in bilateral and trilateral mechanisms.  For example, India is increasing its training with Vietnam’s military and coast guard on their common platforms.  And the Japan-Australia-India trilateral meeting last year was a welcome development and addition to the region’s security network. And third, and even more broadly, all of our nations are creating a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – through the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus.  Later this year, I will host an informal defense ministers’ dialogue in Hawaii, with all of the ASEAN countries, to discuss common interests, and find new ways to ensure regional security. That’s all to the good, but it’s important to remember, as I said earlier, that this Asia-Pacific security network is not aimed at any particular country.  The network’s not closed and excludes no one.  Although we have disagreements with China, especially over its destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea, we’re committed to working with them and to persuading them to avoid self-isolation.  That is one reason why, we’ll continue to pursue a stronger bilateral military-to-military relationship with our colleagues in China, including later this month at RIMPAC, which China will participate in again this summer. Let me now turn to the Middle East and North Africa, where – despite much turmoil, turbulence, and transition – our networking is guided by our crystal-clear and lasting national interests.  They remain our North Star in a confused region. There we’re focused on what I’ve called, the “two I’s,” Iran and ISIL. On the first “I,” Iran, the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but in other respects our concerns with Iran persist.  And because of its reckless and destabilizing behavior in that part of the world the Defense Department remains full speed ahead – in our investments, our planning, and our posture – to ensure we deter Iranian aggression, counter Iran’s malign influence, and uphold our ironclad commitments to our regional friends and allies, especially Israel. The other challenge in the Middle East is, of course, ISIL.  ISIL threatens our interests, those of our friends and allies in the region and around the world, and our homeland.  That’s why our military campaign, which I outlined at Fort Campbell in January, has these three necessary elements: first, to destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria; two, to combat the emerging metastases of ISIL worldwide; and three, all the while, to help protect the homeland. On that last objective, every day, our homeland security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies are aggressively and skillfully pursuing a whole-of-government effort to protect the homeland.  And the Defense Department does everything it can to help. While we work to do so, the U.S. military has also been taking action abroad with a 30-member military coalition to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and show that there will not be an Islamic State based upon this ideology.  Beyond those two countries, we’re also building a transregional network of anti-terror nodes to counter ISIL, and other terror groups, wherever they metastasize – in the Middle East, in North Africa, in South Asia, or elsewhere. Before I describe that network, let me walk you through the coalition military campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  Our strategic approach is clear: the way to ensure that the defeat of ISIL is lasting is to enable capable, motivated local forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria who can seize, hold, and govern territory retaken from ISIL.  That’s frustrating at times, we all know, but there’s just no substitute if we’re going to ensure that after ISIL is defeated, it stays defeated.  We’ve been accelerating our campaign dramatically since last Fall… pressuring ISIL from all sides, across all domains, and simultaneously.  And the campaign is producing results on the ground, creating and seizing new opportunities, and continuing to gather momentum. As we meet here today, the U.S. military is supporting local, capable forces in three major operations in Iraq and Syria, along with a number of other activities.   In Western Iraq, we’re assisting the Iraqi Security Forces in their operations to clear Fallujah under the command of Prime Minister Abadi.  Fallujah is one of the last remaining urban centers under ISIL’s control in Anbar province, and its retaking will follow the results of the Iraqi Security Forces in Ramadi, Hit, and Rutbah.  In Northern Iraq, we’re supporting the Iraqi Security Forces in a major operation to envelop and collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul, while also equipping and funding Kurdish Peshmerga who will converge on Mosul from the North.  And in Northern Syria, we – and our coalition partners – are enabling the Syrian Arab Coalition forces to expel ISIL from Manbij City, after its successful envelopment.  And we’re working with local forces fighting ISIL along the Mara line.  Those operations are particularly critical for helping to seal the Turkish border and cut off the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria and to eliminate external plotting being conducted from Manbij. Meanwhile, we’ve also been pressuring ISIL’s war-sustaining abilities by systematically eliminating their leadership cadre and their financial architecture.  In addition to taking out their ministers of war and finance and capturing one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, we’ve killed some 20 of ISIL’s external operators who were actively plotting to attack our friends and allies and America’s own men and women in uniform.  And we’re continuing attacks on ISIL’s economic infrastructure – from oil wells and trucks to cash storage sites. The counter-ISIL campaign is an example of what we can do when working with local and global partners.  Our global military coalition of 30 nations has trained some 23,000 Iraqi Security Forces, and provided local partners with more than eight full brigade sets of equipment, including ammunition, small, medium, and heavy weapons, and counter-IED equipment.  For our part, the Defense Department is bringing to bear in the fight against ISIL every element of our military power – special operators, conventional forces, air assets, intelligence and surveillance, cyber and space capabilities, logistics and sustainment. And that’s generating real results on the ground.  But Orlando is a reminder that all nations must do more to defeat ISIL.  The sooner we deliver it a lasting defeat, the safer we’ll make our homelands and our people. That’s why, in addition to accelerating the campaign with additional U.S. capabilities, I’ve renewed our outreach to coalition members.  And over the last five months, I’ve convened my counterparts several times – in Paris, Brussels, Riyadh, and then at Stuttgart – to brief them on the coalition military campaign plan, but above all to urge them to contribute more, and in more meaningful ways.  And next month, I’ll once again be hosting defense ministers from every member of the counter-ISIL military coalition here in Washington for the second overall defense ministerial, and to plan and resource our next steps in our comprehensive campaign in Iraq and Syria. We’ve been addressing ISIL’s metastases as well – by degrading it in Afghanistan, targeting its leadership and infrastructure in Libya, and in other actions worldwide. We’ll keep adapting, with our growing network and our strengthening network of coalition partners.  Because the enemy frequently takes the form of a network itself, it must be fought in that way.  An important step I’m taking with Chairman Dunford is to develop a transregional networked approach to counterterrorism generally. This approach leverages infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Levant, East Africa, and Southern Europe.  These so-called regional nodes – from Morón, Spain to Jalalabad, Afghanistan – will provide forward presence to respond to a range of contingencies, terrorist and other kinds…enabling unilateral crisis response, counter-terror operations, or strikes on high-value targets. Those forward nodes will also allow us to enable and network partners to respond to a range of challenges.  They’ll help us pre-position equipment for ourselves and our partners.  And they’ll provide important opportunities to innovate – to develop new command-and-control structure, test new ways to manage our forces, prototype new capabilities, and try out new operational concepts, networked and otherwise. To take full advantage of these nodes and the network they comprise, we have to change how the Defense Department works, and is structured, to ensure better transregional and transfunctional integration and advice.  Right now, the responsibility for integration among the combatant commanders and combatant commands reposed in the Secretary of Defense is inadequately supported by the formal authority of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  That’s why, in some of our proposed improvements to the 30-year-old Goldwater-Nichols Act, we want to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman to, among other things, help the Secretary of Defense synchronize resources globally for daily operations around the world, enhancing the Department’s flexibility and ability to move forces rapidly across the seams between our combatant commands.  And I want to commend Chairman Dunford – who has been leading these critically important efforts. Now, the third, and last region I’ll discuss today, is Europe, where I was last week for the NATO Defense Ministerial.  And of course, NATO has for over 67 years been the quintessential example of nations working together, and networking together, to respond to security challenges. But today, the Transatlantic Community faces new challenges very different from the Cold War – in the East, where Russia is acting aggressively and advancing new forms of hybrid warfare; and on the Southern Flank, with refugees and foreign fighters; and further abroad, in Afghanistan and with ISIL and other terror groups. And in the face of these challenges, the Defense Department is helping NATO adapt and network so it can meet and overcome this era’s challenges to the interests and values of this family of nations. Now, we haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on NATO’s eastern flank for 25 years.  While we all wish it were otherwise, now we do.  Despite the progress that we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent – with its violation of Ukrainian, Georgian, and Moldovan territorial integrity, with its unprofessional behavior in the air, in space, and in cyber-space, as well as with its nuclear saber-rattling – on eroding the principled international order that has served the United States, our allies and partners, the international community and Russia itself so well for so long. In response, as I detailed a year ago in Berlin, the United States is taking a strong and balanced approach to address Russia.  We’re strengthening our capabilities, our posture, our investments, our plans and our allies and partners, all while still keeping the door open to working with Russia where our interests align.  And we will continue to make clear that Russia’s aggressive actions only serve to further its isolation, and further unite the NATO Alliance. Throughout… although the 20th century NATO playbook helped counter the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and ultimately helped win the Cold War, it’s not a perfect match for the 21st century challenges the Transatlantic Community faces.  That’s why NATO’s adapting and writing a new playbook.  That playbook takes the lessons of history and leverages our alliance’s strengths in new, networked ways to counter new challenges, like cyber and hybrid warfare; to integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence; and to adjust our posture and presence so we can be more agile and responsive. Of course, as the alliance’s defense ministers discussed last week when I was in Brussels – and those conversations will continue by the way next month when I accompany President Obama to the NATO Summit in Warsaw, we all need to do more to deter and defend against Russian aggression and to meet the challenges to NATO’s South and further abroad. The United States and the Defense Department are already doing more than our fair share.  We’ve increased funding for our European Reassurance Initiative – more than quadrupling what we requested last year – to bolster our bilateral military engagement in Europe and to strengthen our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression.  Among other things, this funding will allow us to rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team on a heel-to-toe basis into Northern Europe as well as preposition equipment and warfighting gear for another Armored Brigade Combat Team ready to be used by American troops flown into Europe.  This, of course, is in addition to the two brigades we already maintain there, and the… [rotational] combat aviation brigade that’s also been sent to Europe. We’re encouraging our fellow allies to do more as well.  We’ve seen some progress from NATO allies on spending – since the 2 percent pledge made at the 2014 Wales Summit, the vast majority of allies have stopped making cuts, and most allies have also committed to at least small increases in defense budgets – but there’s still more to do.  And that will certainly be discussed in Warsaw as well. Meanwhile, we’re also working within the NATO alliance to develop networked responses to Russian aggression.  For example, the United States has helped develop NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which can deploy allied forces on 48-hours’ notice from multiple locations in Europe to any crisis on NATO territory.  This is a real innovation: one that uses commitments from many members of the alliance to provide a networked response to crises.  And the United States is providing the unique enabling capabilities – airlift and many others – that will make the networked VJTF work. Additionally, and most recently, NATO has also agreed to a persistent Enhanced Forward Presence of four NATO battalions on its eastern flank – one each in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  In Brussels last week, it became clear that the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom will make key contributions – and we won’t be the only ones – though the final details will be determined next month in Warsaw.  This forward presence too will be networked as the rotational forces will be fielded from many NATO countries.  And the resulting combined presence will be an additional deterrent to Russian aggression. Given the many challenges to European security, NATO and its member countries are also networking with non-NATO partners and even non-European partners to ensure the security of the Transatlantic Community and the world.  For example, in Afghanistan, NATO’s Resolute Support Mission continues to help strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.  Recently the President authorized us to use American forces to strategic effect in support of Afghan forces during this fighting season.  And we’re very pleased that other NATO nations have committed not only to provide forces to that mission beyond this year, but also to provide funding to sustain the Afghan forces through 2020, as the United States has also done. Meanwhile, NATO is also providing support to partners like Ukraine and Georgia, helping build the capacity of these former Soviet states and strengthen their capabilities and defense institutions…something that’s particularly important in the face of Russian aggression. To help address the migrant and refugee crisis, NATO is complementing the EU’s work in the Mediterranean Sea, with its own NATO activity in the Aegean Sea.  And the United States is sending the USNS GRAPPLE to support that. And NATO will soon play a more direct role as an alliance in the counter-ISIL campaign – first by contributing AWACS and conducting training and defense capacity building for Iraqi forces inside Iraq rather than in Jordan.  Hopefully that will be the start of more to come. In conclusion, all of this networking demonstrates that whether in Europe, around the Middle East, or across the Asia-Pacific, these inclusive, principled security networks will continue to contribute to national, regional, and global security and help uphold the principled international order. And because of the investments, reforms, and changes we’re making at the Defense Department, the United States will not only remain the most powerful military and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe – we’ll also continue to be the leader and enabler of these networks for decades to come. As a result, we will do more than meet the five challenges of this new strategic era… we will ensure that this time of historic change is also one of historic progress. To ensure it is, we may further change how we invest, how we operate, how we fight, and how we network.  But we will never change why we’re networking with friends and allies and what we’re networking – and willing to fight – for: for our security and interests…for the principles that have benefited so many for so long. That’s what many of you in this room have spent your careers working for.  I thank you for that dedication.  But we’re not finished yet.  We still have work to do.  And, as we continue to pursue that mission, I look forward to collaborating, and networking, with each of you at CNAS Thank you.

"Feb. 3, 2017"," Well, good morning everyone. And thank you, Minister Han, for your warm welcome.  I first visited your valiant country as a 21-year-old lieutenant many years ago and it's good to be back. I appreciate you hosting me and sharing your assessments of the situation we face today.  As you noted, Minister Han, this is my first overseas trip as secretary of defense and I'm here to underscore America's priority commitment to our bilateral alliance and to make clear the administration's full commitment to the United Nations mission in defense of your democracy.  I look forward to working closely together with you and sharing our perspectives is essential to strengthening our already strong teamwork. Yesterday and this morning, I met with acting President Hwang, National Security Adviser Kim and Foreign Minister Yun. From those meetings, I gained a deeper sense of the trusted bonds between our countries built on shared interests and values.  The United States stands by its commitments and we stand with our ally, the South Korean people. Our alliance is a testament to mutual commitment and respect and it is a linchpin of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.  In cooperation with all our allies and partners, the United States seeks to ensure a peaceful, secure and free Asia-Pacific region. Our warm, respectful and mutual supporting relationship shows what democracies can accomplish when guided by a spirit of collaboration in defense of peace and prosperity.  North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior. We stand with our peace-loving Republic of Korea ally to maintain stability on the peninsula and in the region. America's commitments to defending our allies and to upholding our extended deterrence guarantees remain ironclad. Any attack on the United States or on our allies will be defeated and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with the response that would be effective and overwhelming.  Due to North Korea's threatening rhetoric and destabilizing behavior, we are taking defensive steps, like deploying the highly effective THAAD antimissile unit to the Republic of Korea, to protect its people and our troops that stand beside our ally. We are also committed to expanding trilateral venues of cooperation with Japan where the mutual defense of our nations is best served through teamwork.  Today, Minister Han and I will discuss other ways to make certain our militaries are always ready to protect this republic.  Minister Han, it is a privilege to meet with you today. I look forward to our partnership as we work to find common ground for deeper collaboration and to strengthen our strategic alliance. Together, and with a spirit of collaboration, I'm confident we'll continue to provide for the security and prosperity of our nations and the region.  (UNTRANSLATED) and thank you.

"Jan. 4, 2017","Thank you, Chairman Dunford, for that tribute to the President and the First Lady’s commitment to our troops and their families. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Department of Defense leadership, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen – welcome, as the Department honors our Commander-in-Chief of eight critical years one last time.  This afternoon, I’d like to do so by speaking of those aspects of his service and commitment to our national defense that have been so striking and that will be so memorable, each one a constant throughout his tenure as our President:  his focused strategic leadership around the world; his steps to strengthen our force, both in its people as well as its capabilities; and his decision-making.  Through it all, President Obama has led our military with an appreciation that America’s defense is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must ensure its continuity and excellence across the years and across the domains of armed conflict – not just air, land, and sea, but also space, and cyberspace – across parties, across government agencies, from strategic era to strategic era, and from presidential administration to presidential administration.  And he’s done so not only for the last eight years; even today, as we prepare for a new administration, we’re following the President’s leadership and ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. Our military is a global force, one that President Obama has steadfastly and strategically led in every region of the world to ensure the men and women of the strongest and most principled fighting force in history effectively defend our country, deter our adversaries, bolster our alliances and partnerships, and make a better world for our children. In the Asia-Pacific, President Obama has sustained a comprehensive rebalance of military power to that region, the single most consequential for America’s future.  There, we’re repositioning 60 percent of our naval forces and overseas air assets, including some of our most advanced new systems.  And we’re strengthening and modernizing key alliances and partnerships – with Japan, with South Korea, India, Vietnam, Australia, and many others. In Europe, following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and use of hybrid warfare techniques, President Obama has stood strong with our NATO allies and led a united response to deter Russian aggression, enhancing U.S. force presence and implementing a new playbook so NATO can adapt against 21st century threats. In the Middle East, President Obama secured an accord that’s verifiably preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon – removing a key source of danger in the region.  But as we continue to counter Iran’s other destabilizing activities, he’s also strengthened defense relationships with all our key regional partners – for example, providing our ally Israel unprecedented security assistance and advanced capabilities across domains. And around the world, in the face of terrorist threats from al-Qaeda to al-Shabab to ISIL, President Obama has led the most robust and sustained counter-terrorism fight in American history. In the counter-ISIL campaign, the President consistently supported the development and acceleration of our coalition military campaign plan – focused on destroying the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on this evil ideology in Iraq and Syria; countering the ISIL cancer’s metastases everywhere they emerge; and, most important, protecting our homeland and our people.  In addition to countering ISIL, he’s taken action to ensure Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for terrorists to threaten America.  He’s directed eight years of unrelenting strikes on al-Qaeda to devastate that terrorist organization – both before and after bringing Osama Bin Laden to justice.  He’s built a counterterrorism apparatus that has thwarted countless plots against our homeland.  And he did all this – all of it – consistent with our values, because our President knows, as he’s put it, that “we lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend.” At the same time, President Obama made sure our military stayed strong and grew stronger – in our people, and our capabilities – to meet those ambitious but necessary commitments. Indeed, our President knows very well that the single factor above all others that makes the U.S. military the finest is its people – some represented here today, far more around the world. President Obama has been dedicated to improving the quality of life of our force, making sure our servicemembers get what they need – not only when it comes to training and equipment, but also important benefits critical to recruitment and retention, like maternity and paternity leave. He’s helped keep sacred commitments to wounded warriors, to families of the fallen, to military families, and to veterans. He’s helped keep sacred the commitment to wounded warriors, the commitment to the memories of the fallen, to military families, and to veterans. He’s made sure our people are treated with the dignity and honor befitting the profession of arms – from supporting DoD’s efforts to rid our ranks of sexual assault, to improving our suicide prevention efforts. He’s helped ensure the long-term viability of what is, after all, an all-volunteer force recruited in comparatively small numbers from the entire American population, recognizing we have to compete for top talent, and that to have the best we must select the best based solely on their qualifications to meet our high standards – not race, gender, identity, or sexual orientation – rather, focusing only on whether someone can meet our standards. And he’s also supported veterans in their transition to whatever’s next for them in life – whether it’s earning a degree, finding a job, or starting a business.  I know how much that matters, because I’m old enough to remember a shameful time when veterans were treated very differently. After our people, it’s America’s capabilities that make our military edge second-to-none – and President Obama has sharpened that as well.  He always asks, “Are we looking around the corner?” – to ensure we not only anticipate the changing nature of warfare and future threats, but also stay ahead of them, and take full advantage of new technology. Under his leadership, DoD began returning to full-spectrum capability in the Army and Marine Corps after many years of skillful but all-absorbing focus on large counterinsurgency deployments.  We grew the size and lethality of our Navy, and drove forward development and production of new fighters, bombers, and tankers for the Air Force.  We increased funding for innovative technologies and R&D – notably in critical domains like space, cyber, and electronic warfare – all this amidst persistent budget turbulence and uncertainty.  And even as President Obama has worked toward a world without nuclear weapons, he’s also ensured the United States maintains a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent for as long as these weapons exist. And finally, finally, from the vantage of someone who has worked for 11 defense secretaries over the last 35 years, under both Democratic and Republican presidents, and now being Secretary myself, I want to offer some perspective on the nature and quality of President Obama’s leadership and decision-making as our Commander-in-Chief.  Because it’s often most appreciated by those who’ve had to sign deployment orders, who’ve been to Dover, Bethesda, Walter Reed – who know the decisions he makes have consequences. Most Americans don’t get the chance to see how President Obama makes decisions about our national security.  So let me give you a window into what it’s like when we meet in the Situation Room or the Oval Office. To begin with, he’s steady, and deliberate, and rigorous, and demanding – of himself and of us – always reflecting the seriousness with which he approaches the grave responsibilities of the presidency.  He makes us think through the consequences of a proposed course of action as thoroughly as they can be foreseen.  And he always focuses first and fixedly – soberly actually – on our North Star:  America’s national interests. I’ve been grateful that I always got a full hearing for my views and recommendations.  And in my observation, Chairman Dunford always did as well – for President Obama valued not only my strategic advice and his other advisors, but also candid professional military advice.  And he was always willing to listen to what we had to say, even if I knew it wasn’t something he wanted to hear. President Obama also knows it’s not only whether the decisions made are good that matters, but also whether they are implemented with excellence.  Now, that’s a management style that’s actually rare among policymakers in Washington.  Whether it was accelerating the counter-ISIL campaign, stopping the spread of Ebola, or rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific, President Obama has always insisted on seeing the job done right to the end.  He never hesitates to ask hard questions, and keep asking until there’s an answer.  That’s not only because he wanted his decision met and our objective achieved – though both are important – but because he was committed to making sure all our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines had what they needed to do their job. As you heard from Chairman Dunford, that kind of commitment means a lot to our troops.  I’ve seen that up close as well.  Many times I’ve visited servicemembers on bases after the President had stopped by, or wounded warriors and their families at military hospitals after he’s visited with them.  And no matter how much time had passed – whether he’d visited the week before, the month before, or the year before – they remember the genuineness of President Obama.  They can feel, as only young troops can, the unending concern he has for our men and women in uniform and their families, and the boundless care with which he makes decisions that put them in harm’s way. Over the course of eight years, President Obama’s level of dedication and mastery of his responsibilities has been remarkable.  It’s difficult for anyone to imagine the toll of never being able to unplug from their duties and their stakes for that long, all the while being a gracious and inspiring example – and all the while also helping raise two daughters.  It’s impossible to imagine a man carrying more – although possibly two sons! Mr. President, for all this and more, I have been proud to serve as your Secretary of Defense.  And from me and the entire Defense Department, thank you in full measure for your leadership, your support, and your devotion to our country and its defense.  May you begin to feel the great weight shift from your shoulders.  May you feel the warm wind of a nation’s gratitude at your back.  May God bless you and your family.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Barack Obama.

"March 17, 2016","Chairman McCain, Senator Reed, all Members of the Committee: Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here, from me, the Chairman [of the Joint Chiefs of Staff], and from our Under Secretary [for Comptroller], and above all, for your steadfast support to our, DoD’s, men and women all over the world, military and civilian alike, who serve and defend us.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford, and we will be discussing the President’s 2017 defense budget, and other matters – a budget which marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense. In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, and 20, and 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much-needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to help pass it.  That budget set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future. Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world, as we’ve been since the end of World War II.  That’s thanks in large part to the unequivocal strength of the United States military.  And as we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era, as has been noted.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget. I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL – which we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing.  We’re doing that in Africa and elsewhere, and also in Afghanistan, where we continue to stand with the Afghan government and people.  And all the while, we’re continuing to help protect our homeland.  As we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding this year – requesting 50 percent more than last year. We’ve gained momentum against ISIL since the Chairman and I last appeared before this committee.  Notably, the Iraqis retook Ramadi, and are now reclaiming further ground in Anbar Province.  In Syria, capable and motivated local forces supported by the United States  and our global coalition have retaken the east Syrian town of Shaddadi, severing the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq.  Meanwhile, 90 percent of our military coalition partners have committed to increase their contributions to help defeat ISIL.  We’ve increased strikes on ISIL-held cash depots and oil revenues.  We’ve conducted targeted strikes against ISIL in Libya.  And we’ve also recently killed ISIL’s Minister of War, the Chechen fighter Omar al-Shishani. Now, before I continue, I want to say a few words about Russia’s role. Russia said it was coming into Syria to fight ISIL, but that’s not what it did.  Instead, their military has only prolonged the civil war, propped up Assad, and as of now, we haven’t seen whether Russia has retained the leverage to find a diplomatic way forward, which is what the Syrian people need. One thing is clear, though.  Russia’s entry into Syria didn’t impact our campaign against ISIL.  Along with our coalition partners, we’re intensifying our campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, and we’ll continue to do so until ISIL is dealt a lasting defeat. Two of the other four challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great power competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance to the region to maintain the stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, in other respects our concerns with Iran persist.  And while I’m on the subject of Iran, and given this committee’s particular interest in this matter, I want to say a few words about Iran’s treatment of our sailors on Farsi Island back in January.  As I’ve made clear, Iran’s actions were outrageous, unprofessional, and inconsistent with international law, and nothing we’ve learned about the circumstances of this incident since then changes that fact. And it’s because of Iran’s reckless and destabilizing behavior in that part of the world that DoD remains full speed ahead – in our investments, our planning, and our posture – to ensure we deter Iran’s aggression, counter its malign influence, and uphold our ironclad commitments to our regional friends and allies, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Now, addressing all of these five challenges requires new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, we know we must deal with all of these five challenges across all domains –  not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also especially in cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also led to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit. Key to our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to ensure that anyone who starts a conflict with us will regret doing so.  In our budget, our capabilities, our readiness, and our actions, we must and will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We see it in the South China Sea, and in Crimea and Syria as well.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting. In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us address better these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces, as has been noted, and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts.  In our Navy, we’re emphasizing not just increasing the number of ships, which we’re doing, but especially their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships, and extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017 to, among other things, help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will keep ensuring our dominance in all domains. As we do this, our budget also seizes opportunities for the future.  That’s a responsibility I have to all my successors, to ensure the military and the Defense Department they inherit is just as strong, if not stronger, than the one I have the privilege of leading today. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, innovating operationally, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – as we always have, to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we need to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent.  Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise – from continuously improving acquisitions, to further reducing overhead, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization. I know Goldwater-Nichols reform is a focus of this committee, and Chairman, I appreciate that.  Goldwater-Nichols was important and had deeply positive results, but after 30 years, as you’ve said, it needs updates.  There are some areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, like not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability.  And there are areas, as you’ve noted, where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, like taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to help address transregional threats, threats in multiple domains, and multiple threats within overlapping time frames. As you know, last fall we began a comprehensive, department-wide review of organizational issues like these to identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of improvement to help formulate DoD’s recommendations to you.  I expect its internal findings by the end of March. This work is important.  Though much is within our existing authority to do so, we look forward to working closely with Congress to implement needed reforms.  And as we discussed over breakfast last week, Chairman and Senator Reed, I look forward to working with you personally on this important matter. Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  The Defense Department doesn’t have, as I’ve said, the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both.  That’s what this budget is designed to do.  And we need your help to succeed. I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, making changes that are necessary and consequential.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what the budget deal gave us – a net total of about $11 billion less is provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act out of a total of almost $600 billion – but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal; it gave us stability.  We’re grateful for that.  DoD’s greatest risk is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester return in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest budget priority for us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration – to prevent $100 billion in automatic cuts that are looming – so we can maintain stability and sustain all these critical investments over time. We’ve done this before, and that same support is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

"Dec. 4, 2014","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Last December, President Obama directed DoD to report back to him within a year with a full-scale review of DoD’s progress in the fight against sexual assault in the military. Chairman Dempsey, General Snow, and I briefed the President earlier this week on that report and the results, and today I’m announcing the review’s findings, as well as the latest actions we’re taking to continue to improve DoD’s prevention and response efforts. I want to thank everyone – and there were many, many involved in this – but I want to thank everyone who was involved in this comprehensive review, which was organized and directed by our Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office and supported by the Defense Manpower Data Center. I want to thank, in particular, our Undersecretary for Personnel and Readiness, Undersecretary Jess Wright. As I think you all know, she has announced her retirement after 40 distinguished years of service to this country. I asked Secretary Wright if she would stay on the job until this mission was complete. She did, and I appreciate that. I know our Defense Department and men and women of this department appreciate it, as well. And thank you, Jess, for your service to this country, many, many long – and, as I said, distinguished – years that you’ve given to this country. Also, General Jeff Snow, to you, thank you. As you all know, General Snow heads up our SAPRO office. To your team, Jeff, thank you – for what you’ve done, your direction, your leadership, your commitment. And to all who work with you, we appreciate it. I think you all know that General Snow is going to stay after my remarks. I’ll take a couple of questions, and then he can take you down into the depth of the review and the results and go as far as you want to go with this. We’ve, incidentally, briefed members of Congress on this over the last 24 hours, as well. As I said, General Dempsey and General Snow and I briefed the President on this two days ago. And the White House has all been briefed. The review both was about qualitative and quantitative measures. We needed and used both to evaluate our progress here at DoD. We asked the RAND Corporation to independently administer a department-wide survey, which was the largest ever of its kind. It received over 145,000 voluntary responses, which is the highest response rate we’ve ever seen. We conducted focus groups that gave us not only direct feedback from our own people, but also recommendations – important recommendations – many of which have been incorporated into the directives that I’m issuing today. And, for the first time ever, we talked to survivors of sexual assault in the military to learn where they have seen progress and where we need to do better. Overall, the data shows that while there have been indications of real progress, measurable progress over the last two years – with improvement in 10 of the 12 specific measures, including reduced prevalence and increased reporting – we still have a long way to go. Sexual assault threatens the lives and well-being of both the women and the men who serve our country in uniform. It destroys the bonds of trust and confidence which [are] at the heart of our military. Eradicating sexual assault from our ranks is not only essential to the long-term health and readiness of the force; it is also about honoring our highest commitments to protect our fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. The Department of Defense has been taking aggressive action over the past year-and-a-half to stop sexual assault. I made this – and I think as you all know – one of my highest priorities as Secretary of Defense. And as I think you all know, I’ve directed over 28 new initiatives over the last [18 months] to strengthen how we prevent and respond to sexual assault in the military; how we support the survivors of this despicable crime; how we screen, educate and train our people; and how we hold accountable not only offenders, but also DoD as an institution, and all of our leaders. We recommended significant military justice systems reforms that have since been codified into law – with the help of Congress, with the help of the White House, and outside groups that have given us much counsel on this and support and help – we improved victims’ rights and privacy, and we implemented a groundbreaking Special Victims’ Counsel program across DoD, giving survivors for the first time a voice in the military justice process. We believe that our efforts to prevent sexual assault are beginning to have an impact. Compared to 2012, the DoD-wide survey we are releasing today shows that the prevalence of sexual assault in the military over the past year has decreased by about 25 percent. We also found that most servicemembers highly rated their commander’s efforts to promote a healthy climate of dignity and respect and discourage inappropriate behavior. And nearly 90 percent reported taking action to prevent an assault when they saw the risk of one occurring. We also believe that survivors are becoming more confident in the military’s response to sexual assault. Compared to 2010, because more survivors participated in the justice system than ever before, we’ve been able to hold more perpetrators accountable. We now have over 1,000 full-time certified response coordinators and victim advocates, and over 17,000 volunteer personnel ready to assist survivors. And after last year’s unprecedented 50 percent increase in reporting, the rate has continued to go up. That’s actually good news. Two years ago, we estimated about 1 in 10 sexual assaults were being reported. Today, it’s 1 in 4. These crimes, however, are still heavily underreported… both nationally, and in the military. So we must maintain our focus throughout the ranks and continue to earn the confidence of survivors. One of the most important ways of earning that confidence is to reduce retaliation against people who report sexual assault. This is a challenge we are very aware of and have been addressing. We now have better data to help us to keep working to be more effective in stopping this retaliation. In 2014, over 60 percent of women who reported a sexual assault perceived some kind of retaliation, often in the form of social retaliation by co-workers or peers. We must tackle this difficult problem head on, because, like sexual assault itself, reprisal directly contradicts one of the highest values our military – that we protect our brothers and our sisters in uniform. When someone reports a sexual assault, they need to be embraced and helped, not ostracized or punished with retribution. Today, I am issuing four new directives to help close these gaps and build on what we’ve already done. We are developing new procedures to engage commanders to prevent professional and social retaliation. We’re also revamping training for junior officers, junior enlisted supervisors, and civilian supervisors, so that they are better prepared to both prevent and respond to sexual assault within their units, and also to reduce the potential for retaliation. While these initiatives will take time to have an impact, they are critical for lasting change. Additionally, to better understand how local environments influence the risk of sexual assault, we are undertaking a wide-ranging study of prevention efforts at a variety of military installations nationwide. There’s much more to be done. For example, RAND’s data showed we have a long way to go in fighting the cultural stigmas that discourage reporting among men, and in addressing assaults that hide under the veneers of hazing or practical jokes. And we must continually reinforce accountability up and down the chain of command. Based on the many conversations I’ve had with servicemembers all over this country, and around the world, I’m also concerned that there may be an increasing use of social media for sexual harassment. Like sexual assault, this problem is not new or unique to the military, but DoD holds its people to a higher standard. If you want to wear the uniform, understanding our core values is not enough. On-duty or off-duty, we must live these ideals and enforce our values every day. DoD will continue its strong and committed efforts to pursue comprehensive and dynamic approaches to fighting sexual assault in the military. President Obama and all of DoD’s leaders – both military and civilian – are committed to doing whatever it takes to stamp out this scourge. In May, I told you about my visit to the DoD Safe Helpline for survivors of sexual assault. I told you about the wall I saw that was covered in anonymous Post-It notes – notes that contained inspiring words of thanks spoken by individuals who called into the hotline. I thought about those notes, as I know all our leaders have, over the months. We ultimately want a military with no more victims, no more calls, no more Post-It notes, no more needed help, and no more efforts to stop it. Because it will be stopped. We’re not there yet, but we will get there. Until then, we will continue working relentlessly to prevent sexual assault. And we will give survivors the help and support they need. I want to thank you all for your coverage of this issue, your continued coverage. And before I take a couple of questions, I want to acknowledge our Vice Chiefs of our services, some Chiefs here, who are with us this afternoon. Their efforts, their leadership, their commitment at stamping out sexual assault would not have come as far as we have come – thank you – without your help and all of your people, and I’m glad you’re here today. It’s been a privilege to work with you on this and many other issues. Thank you very much for what you do. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

"April 1, 2016","Thanks so much, President Rief, my old friend for that introduction.  And to Governor Baker, Governor Wolf, Senator Markey, Congressman Kennedy, DoD family – I see here many friends and partners of long standing – public servants, scientists, entrepreneurs, and more – thank you for being here today. It’s a pleasure to be back in Cambridge to continue advancing what’s been one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense and that’s  building, and in some ways rebuilding, the bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon, and the wonderful, innovative, open technology community of companies and universities that make up one of America’s great strengths. We’ve had a long history of partnership, benefitting both our security and our society, and MIT is proof of that.  From the Rad Lab’s pioneering work on radar during the Second World War; to developing computer navigation systems that not only guided ballistic missiles, but also landed men on the moon; to the groundbreaking work that continues today at Lincoln Labs; this has always been a place where great minds and great ideas come together to help defend our country and build a better world. That is, in fact, the mission of the Defense Department.  That’s why we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And that’s what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines do every day, all over the world.  They’re working right now with our coalition partners in more ways – in more ways every day – to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will do.  They’re training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific, ensuring that the most consequential single region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard on the Korean Peninsula, and countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies.  And all the while, they’re helping protect our homeland. Our men and women in uniform do this in an increasingly competitive and changing world – particularly when it comes to technology.  When I began my career, in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  Today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  And the technology base is global.  Indeed, technologies once long possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors.  Meanwhile, nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap. So to stay ahead of those challenges, and stay the best, we’re investing aggressively in innovation. We’re pushing the envelope with research into new technologies – robotics, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, and hypersonic engines that can fly at five times the speed of sound, and many, many others. We’re building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions – so more of America’s brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or a project, and so our military and civilian technologists, and the innovative defense industry that supports us already, can interact in new ways with the entire innovative ecosystem. And we’re developing new partnerships with our nation’s innovative private-sector and technology communities – in places like Boston, and Silicon Valley, and Austin, Seattle, and America’s many other great hubs of unrivaled innovation. As I often say, we in the Pentagon need to think outside our five-sided box, and formulate new ways to keep that enduring American technological edge, and it is, after all, a new technological and competitive landscape.  That’s why we’ve established an innovation hub in Silicon Valley and plan similar steps in other tech hubs – more on that later.  That’s why we created the Defense Digital Service – Is Chris here? Our director of our Defense Digital Service? There’s Chris; by the way, if you want to get in and do something that really matters and you’re a technologist, see Chris. – the Defense Innovation Board, which I just established, which Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and now Alphabet, is now chairing; new internships and externships for technologists uniform and civilian, new ways of accessing the American population, including women, for what is after all an all-volunteer force.  And why we’re investing nearly $72 billion in R&D in the budget I just submitted to the Congress – more than double, by the way, what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D last year combined. And right here, right now, we’re taking another step forward. Today I’m announcing that the Department of Defense is partnering with Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, which Rief has already described – a competitively-selected consortium of 89 companies, universities, non-profits, research organizations, and startup incubators across the country – to establish a new manufacturing innovation institute focused on revolutionary fibers and textiles.  This is a pioneering field, combining fibers and yarns with things like flexible integrated circuits, LEDs, solar cells, electronic sensors, and other capabilities to create fabrics and cloths that can see, hear, sense, communicate, store energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, change color, and much more. The Defense Department is making a $75 million-dollar investment, which has already been matched more than three times over, with more than $240 million in contributions from our public- and private-sector partners.  And like the seven other manufacturing innovation institutes established by the President over the last four years – five of which DoD has helped lead, I should mention, in the areas of 3D printing, lightweight metals, integrated photonics, digital manufacturing and design, and flexible hybrid electronics – this will ensure that the innovations needed to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these cutting-edge materials will happen right here in America.  The President takes a personal interest in these institutes, I should tell you, asks about them, and I’ve spoken with him about all of them a number of times.  So I know how important it is to him that America keeps leading in manufacturing innovation and continues to bring great manufacturing jobs back home.  Because a strong U.S. economy, I know, is the bedrock of American security. With the range of innovators involved in technical textiles here in New England and the greater Northeast – including companies like Bose, and New Balance, and DuPont, and others – this institute will be headquartered here at MIT.  It will be strengthened by a robust network of research partners and manufacturers all across the country – from Oregon to Ohio to South Carolina to Georgia to Pennsylvania. Revolutionary fibers and textiles have enormous potential for our defense mission.  For example, lightweight sensors, woven into the nylon of parachutes, will be able to catch small tears that might otherwise expand in midair, risking paratroopers’ lives.  Uniforms with electronics embedded in their fibers will be able to detect potential chemical and radiological agents, help power the various networked devices that our troops carry into the field, and know when a wounded servicemember might need an anti-bacterial bandage.  And with tents whose very fabrics can generate and store their own power, and even regulate the temperature inside, we’ll be able to reduce fuel consumption on the battlefield – which is critically important when you consider, and I remember this very well, that in the middle of the war in Afghanistan, some years ago, four or five years or so ago, the Army would lose an average of two soldiers for every 50 fuel supply convoys. The reality is that as I stand here, we don’t know all the advances this new technology is going to make possible – that’s the remarkable thing about innovation – and it’s another reason why America, and America’s military, must get there first. The commercial applications of technical textiles will be just as transformative, if not more so, given the drive toward wearables and the Internet of Things.  For example, running shoes as lightweight as socks will be able to sense impact load for every step, so athletes can better understand their physiological condition.  New fibers will strengthen walls and floors in buildings and other structures, reducing construction costs while also providing improved protection from the elements.  First responders will benefit from firefighting gear that’s not much heavier than which exists today, if at all, but yet is vastly more protective against even the hottest of flames.  And instead of tracking physical performance with straps on our wrists, we’ll have the same capability embedded in our clothing thanks to washable, featherweight sensors – providing an even clearer picture of our health and fitness. Now, this is an exciting time – it reminds me of the collaboration between companies, universities, and government that built the Internet and GPS, and before that communications satellites and the jet engine. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on.  And that’s also true for those interested in technology.  But the intersection of the two is truly an opportunity-rich environment. These issues matter.  They have to do with our protection and our security, and creating a world where our fellow citizens can go to school, and live their lives, and dream their dreams, and one day give their children a better future. Helping defend your country and making a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, a technologist, an entrepreneur, or young person can do.  And we’re all grateful to all of you for doing that with us. Thank you.

"Feb. 25, 2016","Thank you, Chairman [Frelinghuysen]; Chairman [Rogers], thank you; Mr. Visclosky, thank you – and all of you, thanks for what you said about the troops.  That means it all.  That’s what I wake up for every morning.  I’m sure that’s true of the Chairman [Dunford] as well.  They are the best of America and we’re very proud to be associated with them, and I’m very pleased to hear you say the same things.  Good for them to hear that too, so thank you, thank you all very much.  And thanks for hosting me today, and in general for your steadfast support to the men and women of the Department of Defense – military and civilian alike – who serve and defend our country all over the world. I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s 2017 defense budget, which marks, as was indicated, a major inflection point for this department.  I’m also pleased to be discussing the budget first before this committee, which has been a leader in securing the resources the department needs. In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal gave us some much-needed, and much-appreciated stability.  I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to pass that agreement.  The Bipartisan Budget Act set the size of our budget, which is why our budget submission, and my testimony, focus on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future. Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe – as we have been since the end of World War II.  I was in Brussels the week before last, meeting with NATO defense ministers as well as defense ministers of the counter-ISIL military coalition – and I can tell you they all appreciate leadership from the Department of Defense of America. As we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and new ways of operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – five – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget. I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, especially ISIL – which we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing in the world.  We’re doing that in Africa; we’re also doing that in Afghanistan, where we continue to stand with the Afghan government and people to counter al-Qaeda, and now ISIL, while at the same time all the while we protect our homeland.  As we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding in 2017 in our request – requesting $7.5 billion, which is 50 percent more than last year. Just this week, following the progress we’ve made in Iraq by retaking Ramadi, we’ve also made operationally significant strides in our campaign to dismantle ISIL in Syria.  There, capable and motivated local forces supported by the U.S. and our global coalition have reclaimed territory surrounding the east Syrian town of Shaddadi, which is a critical ISIL base for command and control, logistics, training, and oil revenues.  More importantly, by encircling and taking this town, we are seeking to sever the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and ultimately dissect the parent tumor into two parts – one in Iraq and the other in Syria.  This is just the most recent example of how we’re effectively enabling and partnering with local forces to help deal ISIL a lasting defeat. Next, two of the other four challenges reflect a recognition of – a return to, in some ways – great power competition.  One challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. DoD must and will address all five of those challenges as part of its mission to defend our country.  Doing so requires new investments on our part, new postures in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, in confronting these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also led to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit. Key to our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to ensure that anyone who starts a conflict with us will regret doing so.  To be clear, the U.S. military would fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will, and must be, prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call “full-spectrum.”  In our budget, our capabilities, our readiness, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we have the capability to win.  Because a force meant to deter conflict must show that it can dominate a conflict. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems – including anti-access systems – that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We saw it last week in the South China Sea, and we see it in Crimea and Syria as well.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Now, we don’t desire conflict with either country.  And while I need to say that they pose some similar challenges militarily, they are very different nations and very different situations, and our preference is to work together with important nations.  But we also cannot blind ourselves to their apparent goals and actions.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting. In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us better address these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces, and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like swarming 3D-printed microdrones, the long-range strike bomber, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions like the maritime-strike Tomahawk, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, and the newly-anti-ship-capable SM-6 missile – in which we’re investing nearly $3 billion to maximize production over the next five years.  We’re emphasizing lethality in our Navy with new weapons and high-end ships, and by extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40 Tomahawks.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017 to, among other things, help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will continue to ensure our dominance in all domains. As we do this, our budget also seizes opportunities for the future.  That’s a responsibility I have to all my successors – to ensure the military and the Defense Department they inherit is just as strong, just as fine, if not more so, than the one I have the privilege of leading today. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re also innovating operationally, making our contingency plans and operations more flexible and dynamic in every region.  It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future  we need to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent from future generations.  That’s also why we’re opening all combat positions to women, as well as doing more to support military families – to improve retention and also to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force.  And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise – from continuously improving acquisitions, to further reducing overhead, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization. Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  We in the Defense Department don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both.  That’s what this budget is designed to do – and we need your help to succeed. I thank this committee again for overwhelmingly supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  That budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest risk we face in the Department of Defense, DoD, is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester and caps in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time. We’ve done this before.  If we think back to historic defense investments that made our military more effective – and not only in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like especially the All-Volunteer Force – they were able to yield tremendous benefits because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations. That same support is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

"June 20, 2017","Just think what happens to you when you say the words “John Glenn.”  Just think of what comes to mind when you hear those words, a gentleman whose name alone was his passport to the trust of the American people. Let me just say that here in D.C., I was talking to some of the young students earlier and a town that sometimes has a wonderfully rambunctious partisan air, but Republican or Democrat it would make no difference when you say those two words, “John Glenn.” The trust is there, and we look upon someone like that with such awe today.  But we never thought, even when we were around him, to take him for granted because it was just a power to John Glenn and what he represented.  I will tell you right up front, ladies and gentlemen -- I do not have the words to fully express my admiration and respect for Lyn's father, for Annie's husband, for a man who did what he did. You know, we all need role models in this world.  We all need them because they inspire us to listen to our better angels.  They remind us, if we look at someone like this, that we can always be better the next day. And the role models we choose to remind us of what we can be in this country that gives us so many beautiful opportunities, among mine as I look at the world that I was so fortunate to live in, John Glenn shone very brightly.  And for you students here tonight, you're going to have to look long and hard to find a more decent role model, one who lived by virtue, a word that is often not used in today's America.  But in fact, if you go back to McGuffey's Reader, or if you go back to the 1800's, if you go back to Abraham Lincoln, you find that much more common as we look at how do we evaluate not others, but ourselves -- how you evaluate yourself. And I remember a Marine barracks parade one night, Lyn, with your father -- I was the hosting officer there.  And as it gets toward evening, everybody goes and sits in the bleachers.  The Marines are lined up in the dark. And there I was with Senator Glenn, standing there together in the shadows waiting to go out front and act important.  And as we stood there, John Glenn was reminiscing -- Dean, it won't surprise you -- he was looking back on his time as a Marine.  He said, ""You know Jim, I was a Marine for 23 years.  Wasn't nearly long enough."" Interesting comment for a man who rose to the heights he did in the space program, in the Senate, and certainly in the hearts of us all.  And you think of a man who fought in World War II, became an ace during Korea, the first man to orbit the Earth, his time in the Senate for a quarter of a century, and he exemplified I think the expression, which is so dear to the American Marines of Semper Fi. Semper Fidelis, ""always faithful,"" because he was always faithful to his country, to his Marines, and certainly to his family, and to his childhood sweetheart, Annie. I got to know him and Annie, thanks to my former boss Deputy Secretary of Defense Rudy deLeon, who joins us here this evening.  I was Rudy's senior military assistant, and he was quite aware that I swore I would never set foot in the Pentagon again when I left your duty.  Be very careful what you proclaim to yourself or the world, I will warn you. He was also spent many years with Senator Glenn on the Hill, and is a noted public servant in his own right.  And I would tell you, too, that he taught me a bit about Senator Glenn, and then I was, of course, exposed to the senator.  And I would get him talking on many occasions, on the phone or in person.  And when you think of a man born in 1921, and human-kind had barely really gotten its aviator wings in the air at that time.  And eventually, he would actually take us into outer space. And I think that he always excelled.  He didn't just dabble in things.  For you young folks, again, to pick out something that you really love, that you really want to throw yourself into and excel, is a part of having meaning in life.  So pick wisely and work hard. He was always faithful to his fellow Marines.  And in that war in Korea, a Marine reservist who was making a lot of money, the finest baseball player of his era, one of the finest-ever, Ted Williams, came back on active duty when his country called.  He didn't try to get out of it.  Came back on active duty, and guess who his wing-man was?  None other than John Glenn.  What an all-American story that is when you think of these two fly-boys up there together. He was granted in his later years some of Ted Williams's language that was somewhat uncouth, but Annie could walk into his house with the senator, and as soon as she heard the first bad word, she's say, ""Now, Theodore, stop that.""  And the finest baseball player in the world immediately kowtowed to Miss Annie, and carried on listening to his better angels. One time Ted Williams was hit by enemy fire, and his plane was on fire.  You know, he's coming in, and everyone is telling him to punch out.  And of course, in those days, the way you punched out was very injurious.  He knew he'd probably never play baseball again if he survived.  So he rode the plane in.  And all the way in, it was John Glenn coaching him to land a plane on fire without its wheels down.  And you can imagine that that's just one more time that Cool Hand John Glenn was able to be there always faithful alongside others.  And you'll notice a theme here… that he sticks with you.  The tough times to him are just times to get tougher.  You don't fade away. And after serving in Korea, becoming a Navy test pilot, he got interested in space, and you all know what happened.  He excelled once again, strapping himself to the nose-cone of what was then an intercontinental ballistic missile that could launch him into outer space.  And some ladies with slide rules had figured out, ""Yeah, we think we can bring you back, too, if you do this and that."" And wouldn't you know?  Something went wrong.  And for those of you who've been to the third floor there and looked at that little handle, like something out of a 1970s video game or something, you know.  And to think he was able to bring her home like that, and a 14-year-old Lyn watched her father, probably holding her breath, for somewhere around several hours, hoping that dad would get home. So he comes out of NASA.  He becomes this celebrated leader on the Senate floor.  When John Glenn spoke, he was listened to.  It was not just the gravitas.  It was an actual mastery again of what he was doing, and a deep and abiding love for the people he represented and for the Senate itself -- something to remember when we're in a town that sometimes takes cheap shots at an organization that so much is riding on. So you have to say, to The Ohio State University, to Glenn College faculty, to the Buckeye community… I will just tell you right up front I am humbled by this award.  And you can understand why when I think of standing here and being recognized by the words of the dean and the words of Lyn, Senator Glenn’s beloved daughter. I would just tell you that it's about public service.  It's not about me.  And I'm not being falsely modest here.  It's about public service.  We're trying to build a country here, and its noble work.  And the work is never done. About an hour's drive northwest of here there's a battlefield cemetery at a place called Antietam.  And there's a statue of a Union soldier up on a pillar there overlooking his comrades.  That pillar is inscribed with the words, ""Not for themselves, but for their country."" And you think of that long-held tradition and how simply it was portrayed by the man we call Senator John Glenn -- not for himself, but for his country.  It was not even a burden for him.  It was truly a pleasure when you met with him and talked with him. But I would tell you, too, that as we build this country in John Glenn's image, ladies and gentlemen, it's good to remember it doesn't matter where you do it, where your family, your parish, or school district, your county, your state, your country, the military, civil service, the intelligence agencies do it.  Wherever it is, it is a noble mission. And you have to remember that, especially when the going gets rough.  And it has gotten a little rough here in our beautiful country. I would just tell you, too, that we give an awful lot of authority to young officers.  For example, in the military, we don't always give them enough authority.  And we do that on purpose, to remind them when we give them the responsibility and not enough authority, it's going to be your teamwork.  It's working with each other in public service.  It means putting aside petty grievances.  It means accepting the humanity of the people standing and working next to you and not characterizing them by a certain political stripe or another, rather by their humanity, by their being the mother of a girl trying to get into college or the father of a son with M.S. It's by remembering we're more connected than we are separated by those issues that have to do with our vision for this country as we all work together to turn it over in as good of shape or better than we received it.  That's our obligation to the next generation. And I think, too, that when you look at John Glenn's friendship with those of us that he impacted, it always amazed me that he drew no distinction between those of high rank or low.  We were sitting in New York's best deli, and a young girl came up to us.  She's knee-high to a duck, and she's got her napkin and she puts it up and asks, ""John Glenn, can I have your autograph?""  And of course, guess what happened then.  The line formed and more are coming up. Well, we had the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  So, at one point, I asked the senator, ""If you want, we can have the bodyguards take care of this.""  He said, ""No, no.""  He said, ""These people all paid my paycheck for my entire life.  The least I can do is sign a napkin or two."" Modest… humble… everybody counts, doesn't matter where they're from, doesn't matter a bit.  They're human beings.  They have a divine spark, and he's going to connect. And that has got to inspire us to be better ourselves each day and for the rest of our lives.  And so, please make sure, as you work and sometimes you get frustrated because our country is imperfect -- thank God, she's imperfect.  Gives us all something to roll up our sleeves and do. But as you get sometimes worn out a little bit by it all, just remember, John Glenn didn't get worn out by it.  He kept at it… he kept at it… and he kept at it.  He held the line on his honor.  He held the line on treating others with a sense of decency. I'm sure he was as tempted as anyone with the frustrations of the day.  As you go on through your life, as you go on through your career, just remember something that Joshua Chamberlin, a man who had fought in the Civil War, said that “in great deeds, something abides.” And I bring that up because there's greatness in every life.  It's just a matter of you giving it that sort of attention -- the sort of attention that comes from putting others first.  # # # ",John Glenn College of Public Affairs - The Ohio State University (2017 Excellence in Public Service Award),https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1226797/john-glenn-college-of-public-affairs-the-ohio-state-university-2017-excellence/
"June 9, 2016","Good morning, everyone!  Thanks for coming out here today, although it’s not hard to do on a beautiful day like this. I asked you all to join us up here on the stage today to talk about the next two links we’re building to what I call the Force of the Future – our Defense Department’s all-volunteer force, the military and civilians, that will help lead and defend our country in the years and generations to come. All of us who work here at the Pentagon are fortunate to be part of what is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  But as we all know, generations change, and technologies change, and labor markets change.  And that’s why one of my responsibilities now – and a job for all of us in the years ahead – is to make sure that amid all this change, DoD continues to recruit, develop, and retain the most talented men and women America has to offer – men and women like you.  That’s what building the Force of the Future is all about. And it’s something we absolutely have to do.  It’s critical we do so to meet and overcome the five challenges we face today – from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism, especially ISIL – and to be flexible and agile in preparing for the future, for unknown dangers we can’t anticipate today.  And it’s also critical we do so in keeping with the military’s character as a profession of arms, and the distinctive nature of public service – because mission effectiveness and the security of this country always have to be job one, for all of us. Now, as many of you know, these aren’t the first two links we’ve built in recent months – in fact, they’re the third and the fourth. Link number 1, which I announced in November, focused on building and expanding on-ramps and off-ramps for talent to flow between DoD and the technology sector in both directions – such as creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows program, making the Career Intermissions Program permanent, and bringing in Entrepreneurs-in-Residence for a year or two at a time.  It also focused on modernizing our talent management systems – creating an Office of People Analytics, resuming exit surveys, and launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help match servicemembers with their next assignments. And the second link, which I announced in January, focused on family retention for military personnel – promoting that critical objective by helping them balance their commitments to the force and their families by expanding maternity and paternity leave, extending childcare hours on bases, and giving families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional service commitments. We’ve taken other actions too, that will help benefit our future force.  We opened all combat positions to women who meet our standards, to expand our access to what is, after all, half of America’s population for our all-volunteer force.  And we’re working with Congress to improve joint duty requirements under Goldwater-Nichols – making them less rigid, and giving top personnel more flexibility to take on command assignments and other opportunities to broaden and deepen their careers. With every announcement related to the Force of the Future, I’ve said there’d be more to come, because competing for good people – military and civilian – is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. So today I’m pleased to unveil the next two links to the Force of the Future that we’ve been working on.  One is for DoD’s uniformed military side, particularly focused on giving the services room to make commonsense improvements to the officer promotion system.  And the other is for DoD’s civilian workforce.  Both are critical, and I wanted to announce them together – even if it meant giving a longer speech – because, as many of you know, whether you’re military or civilian, here at DoD it’s one team, one fight.  And in the end, the goal is the same: this is about our people, and building an effective force that will continue to defend our country and make a better world for our children. Before I get into the details, I want to thank everyone who contributed to this over the last several months – many of them here today.  There’s DoD’s Personnel & Readiness chief, Peter Levine – Peter, thanks for taking on this new role, and to you and everyone in P&R for helping see these initiatives through.  To the Services’ “Ones” and Manpower & Reserve Affairs offices – thank you, all, for working so closely with Peter and his team on all these initiatives.  And I particularly want to thank the Service Secretaries and Service Chiefs, here today, for their advice – Secretary Fanning, Secretary Mabus, Undersecretary Disbrow; General Milley, Admiral Richardson, General Neller, Lieutenant General Lengyel: thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and for your contributions to building the Force of the Future.  We couldn’t have done it without you. With that, let me start with what we’re doing on the military side, to ensure our services have the tools they need to always ensure we’re promoting, retaining, and bringing in the best possible officers to lead our all-volunteer force. Many of you are familiar with ‘up-or-out,’ the term for our system.  This system serves us very well, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be improved. It’s important to recall how and why this system came about.  After the Revolutionary War, American military officers were promoted based on seniority alone, almost without exception – junior officers would wait for as long as 20 years to fill so-called “dead men’s shoes,” and only then was there possibility for promotion. That began to change 100 years ago this fall, when the Navy, and later the Marine Corps, worked with Congress to completely overhaul its officer promotion system – establishing promotion boards, minimum time-in-grade requirements, and maximum age limits.  This was the genesis of ‘up-or-out’:  an officer had to be good enough to advance, or they had to retire.  And after the Army and Air Force adopted the same system following World War II, it created the professional officer corps that’s led our military for decades since, and made it the envy of the world. All this progress was positive.  It ensured a fresh flow of talent, so that our officer corps would continually revitalize and hone its warfighting effectiveness in an ever-changing world. And that’s exactly what we’re trying to do today.  And this brings me to a key principle:  ‘up-or-out’ isn’t broken – in fact, it’s an essential and highly successful system – but it’s also not perfect.  Most of the time, and for most of our people, it works well.  The problem, however, is that DoD can’t take a one-size-fits-all approach.  And ‘most of the time’ isn’t good enough for the Force of the Future. The ‘up-or-out’ system is currently governed by the 36-year-old Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, or DOPMA, that in some cases proves too rigid.  It can limit the ability of our services to achieve the right force mix they need – especially at a time when we’re seeking to promote a wider range of experience, perspective, and training to strengthen the overall effectiveness of our force.  That’s because sometimes DOPMA forces officers to make tradeoffs between strong but overly-specified paths to promotion, and paths that might offer greater career depth or breadth.  It can offer little incentive for officers to focus, specialize, or try something different from a traditional career path, even if doing so would benefit DoD and make our force more effective.  And for individual officers themselves, at times we’ve seen that people who deviate from such strict career paths may be penalized by not being selected for promotion – that’s not always the case, but it does happen.  This hinders our force’s ability to take advantage of the rich value that a full range of opportunities provides. This rigidity is compounded when promotion eligibility is determined by year group – a management mindset that doesn’t really account for the possibility of an overall stronger force comprised of officers with differing experience and training, or of officers who might gain their experiences and training along slightly different timelines.  In some ways it can seem like a crowded escalator, especially in the junior ranks – with everyone moving up together, and any attempt to get off, even temporarily, can make it really hard to get back on. Such rigidity can be constraining to the military services and the Service Chiefs in their effort to attract and retain the best force possible.  It’s also difficult for those who want to open their aperture for professional growth and thereby help us make a better force. Sometimes this system has led us to lose good people.  People with skills we need, but who see better opportunities elsewhere, in places that are less rigid, slow-moving, and bureaucratic, and more agile, creative, and merit-based.  And as future generations increasingly value merit and flexibility, it’s more than just a matter of retention – it’s going to be a matter of recruitment, too. We can and must fix these problems.  That’s why we’re seeking to make four landmark changes to DOPMA.  Together, these stand to be the most consequential changes to our officer promotion system in over 30 years, if not more.  And they’ll improve that hundred-year-old system and help bring it into the 21st century – all with the clear intent of improving the effectiveness of our force, and maintaining its character as a profession of arms. The first change we’re seeking – and this idea by the way is a credit to Admiral Richardson and his Navy team – is for the services to be able to adjust, based on performance, the so-called lineal numbers of their officer corps.  This will help them better balance merit and seniority in the promotion system. Right now, when a promotion board selects a certain number of officers to be promoted, they don’t all move up at the same time.  DOPMA limits how many personnel are allowed for each rank, so officers selected for promotion have to wait for an opening in the rank above them before they can actually get promoted.  Then, when there is an opening, the order in which they move up is determined by lineal numbers, which are assigned to officers based on seniority – that is, based on the date of commissioning or when they were last promoted.  With naval references to lineal numbers dating back at least to 1800, this is one of the last vestiges of the pre-World War I, promotion-by-seniority system.  And sometimes that’s to our force’s disadvantage. It can lead to a particular assignment going to the most senior person on the list, even when someone a bit lower down would be more effective in the job.  It also means that higher-performing officers who get selected for promotion a year or two ahead of theirs peers often have to wait in line behind everyone else more senior – sometimes for a year or more – which prevents putting their talent to use as soon as it may be needed.  And if they get fed up waiting and decide to leave the military for some other opportunity, that hurts us too – it’s counterproductive. So that’s why we’re seeking to change DOPMA to let the services adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance.  It’s a key part of good talent management.  And it’ll help us recognize and incentivize the very best performers – not to mention make promotion even more merit-based than it already is. The second change we’re seeking, to ensure our force doesn’t lose or penalize talented officers who wish to broaden their careers, is the authority for the services to be able to temporarily defer when those officers are considered for promotion. DOPMA has generated very specific timelines for when officers come up for promotion.  Everyone gets considered when the system says they’ve had their current rank for enough time, and they’re considered alongside and in competition with their chronological peers – usually in groups based on when they were commissioned.  To be competitive, everyone is expected to have gained the requisite experiences and knowledge to advance and succeed in their career field, and in the amount of time when the calendar says it’s time to screen for the next rank.  That means the system can penalize any deviation from the typical career path – even one of significant benefit to a service and an officer. Take Army Lieutenant Joseph Riley, for example, who was a Rhodes Scholar and the nation’s top ROTC cadet in 2013.  Because he spent two years at Oxford instead of holding the typical military jobs expected of the Army’s junior officers, the system almost didn’t promote him, and in fact was on a track to separate him from the military entirely – that is, until General Milley heard about it last fall and intervened, thankfully. We can’t have a system that inadvertently almost kicks out a Rhodes Scholar just because the calendar tells us to.  That’s a disincentive to those who might otherwise take advantage of a broadening opportunity – like earning their doctorate, or pursuing other advanced training, or doing a tour with industry – to gain experiences that will make them a better officer.  We need people who’ve had those kinds of diverse experiences; they help keep us innovative and open to new ideas that can make us better.  A PhD, a Masters, or another experience or form of advanced training doesn’t make for a diverted warrior – it makes for a smarter warrior. And if the services can allow those warriors temporarily to defer their promotion boards, it will help ensure that officers and their personnel managers who pursue less traditional career paths for them won’t be harmed for it, and give them time to meet all of DOPMA’s promotion requirements before they’re considered for promotion. Now, the third change we’re seeking for DOPMA has to do with what’s known as lateral entry.  As many of you know, civilian doctors can join the military at officers’ ranks commensurate with their skill and experience.  But in most other specialized fields, there’s no way for the services to recruit a properly-skilled and experienced civilian who wants to serve in uniform without them having to start at the lowest ranks. That’s mostly intentional.  Growing our own military leaders is part of being a profession of arms, and frankly, no civilian job can prepare a person to lead an infantry or armored brigade in the field, command a fighter squadron or a bomber wing, or skipper a submarine or an aircraft carrier at sea.  Only years of training and experience in the military can do that. However, this can be problematic in some very specific areas, such as cyber and other science – scientific – and technological fields, where jobs are not only high-skill, but also hard-to-fill, rapidly changing, and in high demand by the private sector.  Here, DoD civilians can sometimes help fill gaps in expertise, but not always.  The fact is, some missions have to be done by someone who has the legal protections we afford our military personnel. So in those situations, when perhaps a network defense or encryption expert from a tech company feels a call to serve, and is willing to contribute to our mission as a reservist or on active-duty, we need a way to harness their expertise and put it to use.  We may not be able to offer as much money as the private-sector, but we can offer the noblest of missions.  We can offer the most intriguing of problems.  And we should be able to offer a rank, status, and leadership position commensurate with their abilities. We’ve done this before in similar career fields.  During and in between World War I and World War II, the Army Signal Corps granted mid-grade commissions to early radio communications and broadcast pioneers.  One was Edwin Armstrong, inventor of wideband FM radio.  Another was David Sarnoff, the head of RCA, who served on General Eisenhower’s staff in England before and after D-Day, and after the liberation of Paris helped reestablish its communications links with London and New York. Now, I have to say we can’t do this for every career field – far from it.  It will probably never apply to line officers, as they’ll always need to begin their military careers as second lieutenants and ensigns.  But allowing the military services the flexibility to commission a wider segment of specialized outside talent – talent who can meet our standards, who provide unique skills we need, and who are willing to serve in uniform – will help fill critical gaps in our force.  And it will make us more effective. And this brings me to the fourth and final DOPMA change, which is intended to make room for an uncertain future.  Here, we’re seeking enduring flexibility for future defense secretaries to let the services make needed tweaks to DOPMA-related policies down the line, for purposes of improving the force.  While the other three changes are about providing specific solutions to specific problems, this change will help us be prepared for what we can’t anticipate. We know there may be unforeseen problems that could come up five, 10, or 20 years from now.  We also know we’ve never been perfect at predicting the strategic future.  So under certain conditions, the services need to be able to waive select DOPMA constraints to very quickly build up expertise in a critical career field.  This flexibility will enable the services to respond to an uncertain future, in ways that can be tailored to their unique capability requirements and particular personnel needs, without casting off a system that still largely meets our needs for most officers across the force. Now, for each of these changes, we’ll need Congress’s help to provide the proper authorities, but there’s good news here, because we know some on Capitol Hill already agree with us.  And I greatly appreciate that over the past year, Congressional leaders from both parties have expressed support for reviewing DOPMA and making some commonsense improvements to help strengthen our warfighting effectiveness.  We’ve already been working with Congress very closely on this, and I’m looking forward to partnering with both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to get this done. We’re seeking permanent authorities for all this, not temporary or pilot authorities, because we can’t expect our officers to plan 30-year careers around something temporary.  And once these tools are implemented, we’ll be looking to the Service Chiefs and Service Secretaries to lead the way in putting them to good use to strengthen the warfighting effectiveness of our all-volunteer force. Now in addition to the legislative authorities we’re seeking, I’m also announcing a couple more measures were taking to help our military recruit the best talent America has to offer – officers and enlisted alike. For one, we’re going to modernize our system for recruiting and processing new personnel into the military.  That means no more paper forms.  Plenty of our personnel can tell stories about having to fill out the same packets of paperwork over and over again – not a good sign for a new recruit who’s been hearing that we’re the most technologically advanced military in the world.  Force-wide, enlistment alone requires processing 70 to 80 million pieces of paper every year.  That’s slow, expensive, and it’s inefficient.  So over the next five years, we’re going to move to an all-digital system. We’re also going to expand work being done by DoD’s Joint Advertising, Market Research & Studies program, known as JAMRS, to leverage recent advances in data science and microtargeting to build a precision recruiting database, aimed at making sure we have access to America’s entire population. And this is important, because our military’s geographic pools are shrinking.  Today 40 percent of those who join the military come from just six states.  Most ROTC and academy graduates come from northern states, while the vast majority of our enlisted force hails from states in the southern part of the country.  In some ways that’s not surprising.  Military recruiting tends to be most successful in the South, Southwest, and Big Sky Country, and it tends to be most difficult in the Northeast.  But it’s also paradoxical, since the Northeast is among the regions with the highest percentage of young Americans eligible to serve. If we’re going to ensure we keep recruiting top talent in future generations, we have to fix this.  And we have to start now, because it’ll only get harder as the economy continues to improve, and as fewer and fewer young Americans know people who’ve served.  We can’t keep fishing in the same old ponds.  Instead, we have to fish in more ponds, new ponds, and ponds we haven’t been in in a long time.  We have to draw talent from our country’s entire pool of population for our all-volunteer force. And here’s the new approach we’re going to take.  Rather than identifying geographic and demographic groups that already have a higher propensity to serve, and sending recruiters to find people like them – which is what we do now, and will continue to do – we’re going to also build and use this precision recruiting database to identify those who’d be a great servicemember, but might not know it.  Or maybe they didn’t bother to think about it.  Or maybe there’s some misconception about the military that’s keeping them from doing so.  Or maybe they don’t know a coach, or a teacher, or a principal who’s been in the military, and can point them in that direction.  Either way, we’re going to reach out and make it clear that DoD is a place where they can be part of something bigger than themselves, where they can contribute to helping defend our country and making a better world, where they can improve themselves as they start out in life. So that’s the military side.  Now let me turn to DoD’s civilian workforce, and the new steps we’re taking to continue keeping it great.  And here, I have to say that far too often, our civilian workforce gets treated like a political punching bag.  It doesn’t deserve that.  You – you, the civilians in the audience today – don’t deserve that. When people talk about DoD civilians, they’re talking about over 700,000 patriotic Americans, more than 85 percent of whom live and work outside the D.C. area, serving across the country and all over the world.  And they do critical jobs – helping repair our ships and airplanes; providing logistical support to our troops; designing, developing, and acquiring weapon systems; preventing sexual assault; helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured; and much, much more. There’s no question that what our civilians do is often different from what we expect of our uniformed servicemen and women – that’s because everyone has their role, from military personnel, to civilians, to contractors.  But there’s also no question our civilians are part of the DoD family.  They, too, serve.  They, too, sometimes sacrifice – some supporting troops in harm’s way.  And they’re an equally important part of our Force of the Future. So the goal here is the same as with our military personnel: to make sure our future civilian force is just as great as the one we have today – just as excellent as all of you – by continuing to attract and retain the best talent America has to offer.  And today I’m announcing several new ways we’re going to do that. First, we’re seeking authority from Congress to directly hire civilian employees from college campuses.  And make no mistake: this is going to be huge.  I can’t emphasize that enough. Right now, if a DoD recruiter meets an undergrad student, a grad student, or a recent graduate who’s a perfect candidate for a particular job opening, they have to send them to the USAJOBS website.  For the job-seeker, many of you know what that means: an arduous process of creating an online resume, uploading transcripts and other documents, responding to supplemental questions, having the application processed, and much, much more.  It can take 90 days – and I expect that if you’re lucky – and that’s if you’re lucky, if it’s all moving at lightspeed.  And that’s not even counting the time it takes for a security clearance. Some people are able and willing to wait that long, and we’re lucky for that.  But in today’s job market, if you’re a computer science or other STEM major graduating from Stanford or MIT or the University of Texas, or someone else very qualified with advanced training, you’re not going to wait three more months after you applied for us to make you an offer.  Competing employers aren’t going to do that.  By the time we get around to it, chances are you’ll have gotten another offer already – if not accepted it already, and shown up for your first day of work somewhere else. That’s bad, but it’s also easy to fix.  After all, being able to make a tentative offer to an exceptional candidate coming out of school isn’t unique in government – the intelligence community has been doing it for decades.  It also affords our civilian workforce one of the benefits of our military’s ‘up-or-out’ system, which is the easy infusion of young, fresh talent. This has the potential to be a real game-changer for us.  Our civilian recruiters will be able to go to campus job fair, do some interviews, and if they find someone who’s the right fit, they can make a tentative offer on the spot, pending security clearance – potentially cutting down those 90 days to zero. Second for our civilians is that we’re seeking to create a new two-way talent exchange program with the private sector. Right now we have very few such programs, with very limited scope.  If we want to send a civilian from the Defense Logistics Agency or TRANSCOM to spend six months at a place like Amazon or FedEx to see what we might be able to learn, there’s no formal mechanism for that.  And the same goes for the opposite direction, if we want to host people from those or other companies. So we want to create a program to facilitate that – with all the proper ethical safeguards, of course.  And being able to temporarily exchange civilian employees, talent, and best practices with some of America’s best and most innovative companies will help DoD stay on cutting edge, and be more efficient and effective. And third for the DoD civilians, we’re calling on Congress to make their maternity and paternity leave paid instead of unpaid.  Parental leave is fully paid for military personnel, and the same should be true for their civilian colleagues. This is important for retaining civilian talent, especially since we want to retain people who are experienced, but not at the end of their career – which is exactly the time people are having families. We can’t afford to risk losing civilian talent just because private-sector companies will pay them during their maternity and paternity leave, and we won’t.  So it’s time to get this done. As with the changes to DOPMA, we need Congress’s help on each of these.  But here too, there’s also good news – we’ve been working together already, and we’re pleased with the positive support we’ve seen, particularly for the on-campus hiring authority.  And I’m looking forward to partnering with the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to finish what we’ve started. Finally, in addition to the civilian legislative proposals, I’m also announcing several more initiatives today that we’ll be doing on our own to help build our civilian force of the future.  And let me highlight a few examples, out of many. For one, we’re going to better leverage our existing authorities to directly hire Highly-Qualified Experts into jobs across the department.  Today we only have about 90 such experts across – onboard – across DoD, including some really talented and innovative people like the director of the Defense Digital Service, the head of DoD’s Strategic Capabilities Office, and the Air Force’s Chief Scientist.  And we’re way below the maximum.  Having such experts around is often a force-multiplier, so we’re going to use this authority more often, and increase our number of Highly-Qualified Experts by 10 percent a year over the next five years. We’re also going to increase participation in the dozens of career broadening programs we currently offer for civilians – likewise by 10 percent a year over the next five years. And we’re going to expand DoD’s decade-old scholarship-for-service program, which brings in graduates in mission-critical STEM fields to build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders.  This has helped us attract hundreds of outstanding young civilians graduating from top universities – Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, Cal Poly, and many more.  And the program retains talent too: over 70 percent have stayed beyond their service commitment.  So we plan to increase the number of scholarships we offer – here too, by 10 percent each year over the next five years. And those are only a few of the examples; we’ll be doing even more. Now let me close by saying that while all these efforts represent the capstone of how we’re building the Force of the Future, it’s also not the end.  Because this is an ongoing process – there’s much work to be done with Congress, and as we implement and refine each initiative we’re pursuing, we’ll also continue to look for new ones. I know I’ve announced a lot today, but we’re a big organization.  And every time I walk the halls around the Pentagon, and travel to our installations across the country and around the world, I see example after example of what makes us so great: our people.  I know these changes will help you fully exercise your talents, and ensure that you’ll always have good people to your left and to your right – and in future generations – who are just as excellent as you are. You’re part of how we’ll make that happen, because you’re our best ambassadors.  You know better than anyone why the military, and why public service as a whole, is worthy of consideration as a career – not only for the difference it can make in our own lives, but the difference it lets us make in the lives of others. So I look forward to seeing you in the hallways, and talking with you about all this and how it’s going to make us even greater. Thanks for everything you do.

"July 27, 2016","Good morning, everybody. And Steve, thanks. Thanks for that introduction, for your leadership here of the storied 18th Airborne Corps. And thanks to all of you sitting here, for everything you do, every day for us. I know that for more than year now, as Steve mentioned, you've been training hard to provide us with a global response force. I don't take that for granted, every single day. And your recent air drop in Poland shows how you can accomplish that mission. So, I just want you to know I'm very proud of you for that, what you have been doing. But most of you will deploy soon, and not for the first time. So, you're going a long way from home, long way from Bragg, to confront a dangerous adversary. And as you do, I will do everything I can to support you in that fight, and support your families back here at home. I know they serve, too, and please thank them on my behalf, supporting you as you keep the country safe. You're joining a historic mission, because never before in modern history have so many nations come together to confront an enemy like ISIL. And we're fighting together in different ways, across all domains, to destroy ISIL, not only in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but everywhere it has spread around the world. Today – thanks to a clear and deliberate military campaign plan, the global coalition we've built, strengthening local forces, and above all, the awesome competence and sacrifices of American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines – we now have momentum in this fight and clear results on the ground. And now, just as this corps deployed almost a decade ago to answer the country's call, I'm calling on you, and the president, and the country and the world are counting on you to take the next steps, execute our next plays, so that we can help our partners collapse ISIL's control over Raqqa and Mosul. Last week in Washington, I convened the leaders of our coalition, defense ministers from over two dozen countries to continue our efforts to rigorously evaluate and accelerate our campaign against ISIL. And together, we made the further plans and the further commitments – plans and commitments that you'll work with our partners to carry out with the awesome competence we expect of America's Contingency Corps. It will help ensure we deliver ISIL the lasting defeat it deserves. So, today, as you prepare to depart, I want to talk to you a bit about the overall campaign plan itself, and how you'll be contributing to it. Our coalition's military campaign plan has three objectives. The first objective is to destroy ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria. As recent attacks remind us – and we've seen some just in the last 48 hours – ISIL's safe havens in those countries threaten not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian people, but also the security of our own citizens and those of our friends and allies. That's why the sooner we defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria – the sooner we destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic State based on ISIL's barbaric ideology – the safer America will be. But while defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria is necessary, it's also important to remember that's not sufficient. We know this cancer can metastasize, and in some cases it already has. We see that in multiple countries, like Afghanistan and Libya where we continue to do what we can to support our partners as they take on the ISIL threat in their countries and do our part to take on ISIL wherever it might exist. And we also see it in the intangible geography and terrain of the internet. That's why our second objective is to combat ISIL's metastases everywhere they emerge around the world. And our third objective, a very important one, is to support our law enforcement partners, our intelligence partners, our Homeland Security partners in protecting our people here at home in our homeland. This part January, I visited with your fellow troopers of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. Like you, they were getting ready to deploy and like you, they weren't the first or the only ones in this fight. And so I briefed them then on our comprehensive Coalition Military Campaign Plan recently updated then to meet those three objectives. I was clear with them then about our campaign's strategic approach and I want to reiterate all that for you as well. Our approach is to identify and enable capable, motivated local forces who, with our strong, our mighty support, can deliver ISIL a lasting defeat. And that's because only local forces can ensure the defeat sticks. U.S. and coalition forces can enable them with our vast military power – and that's where you come in – but it's local forces who in the end must seize and hold territory. The Iraqis and Syrians must govern the territory after it's been retaken from ISIL and restore a decent life to the people who live there. So over the last year, we've pursued a number of deliberate decisions and actions to accelerate this military campaign plan, this strategic approach to hasten ISIL's lasting defeat. A year ago, we put our operations in Iraq and Syria under one single command, charging Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland as the overall commander and he's done an exceptional job. Now, Steve Townsend takes over. I want you to know I've known Steve for years. I admire his exceptional talent and I have total confidence in him to lead you. Subsequent to creating the command structure under General MacFarland, last fall, we introduced an initial series of accelerants to help us gather momentum. For example, we deployed additional strike aircraft, supporting an expanded air campaign against new categories of targets, new types of targets illuminated by refined intelligence. We deployed an initial contingent of special operations forces to Syria and expanded equipping of Syrian Arab forces engaged in the fight against ISIL. As well as the training and equipping of the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga. And we introduced an expeditionary targeting force and we started to expand our military campaign to every domain, including cyber and space. While the United States has led the way with these accelerants, we also asked our coalition countries to make additional contributions to the campaign, which they did – contributing strike aircraft, special operations forces, trainers, engineers, logisticians, lift and other critical enablers. Meanwhile, we also set in motion a series of specific and deliberate steps through the winter, the spring and now the summer – the first plays in the game – as President Obama called it. Since then, local forces, our coalition partners, and American servicemembers have executed those plays – and more, actually – with excellence. And as a result, play by play, town after town, from every direction and in every domain, our campaign has accelerated further …squeezing ISIL and rolling it back towards Raqqa and Mosul. By isolating those two cities, we're effectively setting the stage to collapse ISIL's control over them.

You can see this in Iraq, as I saw during my visit there just a couple of weeks ago. After clearing Ramadi and establishing a staging base at Makhmur, Iraq Security Forces moved on to liberate Hit, and Rutbah and Fallujah. Then, two weeks ago, they seized the strategically important airfield in Qayyarah West, which is a critical logistical springboard for the effort to collapse ISIL's control over Mosul.

And we're also seeing results in Syria. After seizing Shaddadi – the crucial junction on the road between Mosul and Raqqa – our partners on the ground have now surrounded Manbij City, one of the last junctions connecting Raqqa to the outside world, and a key transit point for external plotters threatening our homelands. And there, we're already beginning to gain and exploit intelligence at helping us map their network of foreign fighters. We've also been pressuring ISIL by systematically eliminating their key leaders and their financial base. In addition to taking out some of ISIL's key ministers and capturing one of the principles of ISIL's chemical warfare enterprise, we've killed over 20 of ISIL's external operators, who were plotting or seeking to inspire attacks outside of Iraq and Syria. Wherever our local partners have moved – whether in Anbar, Nineveh or Manbij – we've taken out ISIL's field commanders. Meanwhile, we're continuing attacks on ISIL's economic infrastructure, including oil wells, trucks and cash storage sites. And we're taking the fight to ISIL in every domain, as I said, including cyberspace. Those are real results. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of our local partners and our service members, and additional coalition contributions, we've seized opportunities, reinforced success and taken the fight to the enemy. But we're not going to rest – and that's why you're going to build on those results. Continue to take the fight to the enemy, gather more momentum and help deliver ISIL the lasting defeat it deserves – and I have every confidence you will. Last week, with our coalition partners, we developed and agreed on our next set of plays. And while I can't release the details in public yet – you all know them. As you can imagine, we don't want the enemy to know too much about what we're doing, and what we're thinking, and where we're going and when – I want to broadly describe the basic elements to you today, since you'll be helping lead the execution of these plays. In Syria, our actions will focus on shutting down the last remaining paths for ISIL fighters to move into and out of that country, particularly when it comes to their external operators. So, we'll seek to expand on our recent gains of our local, capable partners in Manbij City and along the Mar’a Line to help them broaden their control over that key terrain. And in addition, we will aggressively pursue opportunities to build pressure on ISIL in Syria from the south, complementing our existing robust efforts from northeastern Syria. This, of course, will have the added benefits of helping the security of our Jordanian partners, and further splitting the Syria Theater of operations from the Iraqi theater of operations. In Iraq, we will continue enabling the dedicated Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, led by Prime Minister Abadi and supported by Kurdish Regional President Barzani, working by, with and through the Iraqi government, as we always have. Our actions in western Iraq will focus on enabling the Iraqi security forces under the direction of Prime Minister Abadi to pursue mopping up operations along the Euphrates River Valley – in order to clear the remaining pockets of ISIL presence, push the ISIL threat further away from Baghdad and help the government of Iraq reassert not only full sovereignty over its borders, but also control over some of its main lines of communications. In the north, we will continue to help the Iraqi Security Forces clear the remaining pockets of ISIL control along the Tigris River Valley. Simultaneously, we'll help the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Kurdish Peshmerga – to refit and generate the forces and logistical footprint necessary to isolate and pressure Mosul. Meanwhile, as this isolation and pressure on Raqqah and Mosul builds from the outside in, our partners will continue to reach deep inside those cities to enable pressure on ISIL from the inside out. All these plays, once executed, will culminate in the collapse of ISIL's control over the cities of Mosul and Raqqah. The United States in the 18th Airborne Corps will be critical to all of this, essential to all of this. As Lieutenant General Townsend and all of you take the handoff from Lieutenant General McFarland and his headquarters elements from III Corps, we'll expect from you all the same high degree of initiative and creativity that Sean and his team have shown. But – and I say this once again, having known and admired Steve for many years now – he's more than up to this task. And I know that Command Sergeant Major Jones and all of you are, too. Of course, while we lead a global coalition, your role in the strategy is to enable but not to substitute for local forces in Iraq and Syria. And the good news is they've been doing well, building momentum. So you're going to help them do even better by leveraging all of our awesome capabilities – airstrikes, special forces, intelligence equipment, mobility, logistics, training, advice, assistance from those on the ground – including you, which is our most important asset, you because you'll help make sure that when things don't go to plan that we rapidly adapt, we innovate, we overcome. You'll also be working with a global coalition that's contributing more and more to the fight. Since February, coalition nations – including the United States of course, thanks to President Obama's consistent and timely support – have provided even more support to accelerate the campaign as our local partners have made advances. In fact, two-thirds of coalition members have pledged or already made additional military contributions since then, while many others have contributed vital economic, political and humanitarian support. And we're all going to be doing even more. For the United States part, President Obama decided to deploy an additional 560 troops just a couple weeks ago to support the ISF in their offensive to retake Mosul. And when I was in Iraq earlier this month, I offered to Prime Minister Abadi to share some of our hard-earned expertise in countering improvised explosive devices with the Iraqi Security Forces. These are just some examples. And other nations are following our lead in making additional commitments as well. France is sending back the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle to carry out airstrikes against ISIL. Australia will be expanding their training of Iraqi police and border guards, which are going to be vital to security in Iraq after ISIL's defeat. And the United Kingdom recently announced it would deploy more trainers and engineers to Iraq as well. And now, of course, even when we win this fight – and let there be no doubt, we will – there will still be much more to be done. There will be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish and communities to restore. Such progress is critical to ensuring that ISIL, once defeated, stays defeated, so that our partners' gains are made irreversible. And so, it's vitally important that when that time comes, just as our partners must make the political and economic changes necessary to ensure ISIL's lasting defeat, the international community must ensure that the Iraq and Syrian people have what they need to hold, stabilize and govern their own territory. For that reason, the international coalition stabilization and governance efforts cannot be allowed to lag behind our military progress behind your progress. And I want you to know that Secretary Kerry and I made that point clear to all of our counterparts when we met with them last week. And it's the State Department, USAID and their coalition counterparts that will be working with Iraqis and the Syrians to provide the humanitarian aid, support immediate stabilization and promote longer- term recovery. And – not unlike how our military campaign has relied on contributions from across our coalition – this, too, must continue to be an international effort. Every member of the global coalition to defeat ISIL should be contributing to help the Iraqi and Syrian people stabilize, rebuild and recover from the scourge and the brutalization that is ISIL. Now, as I said earlier, destroying ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria is necessary, and will be done. But it's not sufficient. That's why, as you enable our partners to expel ISIL from more and more territory in those countries, we're going to continue working more and more with our coalition partners to both combat ISIL wherever else it might attempt to terrorize or take hold in the world, and to ensure that our military campaign does everything possible to best support our national governments' efforts to protect our homelands and our people. Destroying the fact and the idea of an Islamic State based on ISIL's barbaric ideology will not be easy. The more ground ISIL loses in Iraq and Syria, the more they'll do whatever it takes to cling to their perverse veil of legitimacy and power. We and our partners cannot and will not let them. We must deny them the satisfaction of being able to advance their twisted goals. We must keep systematically eliminating every key leader we find, and we must deny them safe haven wherever they may seek it – from physical terrain to cyber space, because that's what's necessary to keep our country safe. And as you, our servicemembers, and our coalition and local partners pursue our next plays, your commanders and I will continue to look at what more we can do in every domain – from every direction, day in and day out – to create and seize opportunities to further accelerate our campaign and to hasten the lasting defeat that ISIL deserves. As President Obama said, “We constantly examine our strategy to determine when additional steps are needed to get the job done.” And I want to assure you that you will get what you need to succeed. To be sure, there will be tough work and difficult days ahead, but we have the right campaign plan, the most capable commanders, motivated partners who are growing in strength, and –most importantly – we have you. As part of the finest force the world has ever known, you are fighting a truly barbaric enemy in a stark campaign. Generation after generation, the American military an indeed the XVIII Airborne Corps, has met the challenges asked of them. All of you are doing the same. This is a fight that must be won, can be won, and will be won thanks to you and the many American service members like you. So thank you again for what you do. And just as importantly, for how you do it and what you stand for. You're incredibly competent of course, but you also conduct yourselves in a way that makes us proud. You don't intimidate, you don't coerce, you don't exclude, you work with allies and partners to ensure a better world for our children. That's one more reason why we're going win. That's why ISIL and it's barbaric ideology are going to lose. You're example, your service, and your daily sacrifices and those of your families are never lost on me. You will forever have my and our nation's profound gratitude. Good luck to all of you. I will see you over there.

"May 27, 2017","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: What a day. As the chaplain put it, what a happy day for our graduates here this morning; for the families that have nurtured them and raised them to take on these challenges; certainly for these over to your left flank here, the ones who want to be graduating, and for the class of 2018, you’re not getting out a month early. By golly, if this class had to go through the full course of difficulty, so will you. But it’s also a great day for the U.S. Army, Gen. Milley, Secretary, to have this reinforcement. And it is a great honor to be here today at West Point, one of the foundational keystones of our nation, and to join you on behalf of our Commander-in-Chief, President Trump, to pay his respects, and the respects of the American people, to the military academy class of 2017. I would never have imagined, ladies and gentlemen, when I joined the military at age 18, that I’d be standing here, nor can you graduates anticipate where you’ll be many years from now. By the time this class was in first grade classrooms in every state across our union, our country had been thrust into a war by maniacs who thought that by hurting us they could scare us. Well we don’t scare, and nothing better represents America’s awesome determination to defend herself than this graduating class. Every one of you could have opted out. You’d grown up seeing the war on ‘round-the-clock news. There was no draft. Colleges across this land would have moved heaven and earth to recruit you for schools that would never make such demands on you as West Point, starting with Beast Barracks, an aptly named introduction to the Long Gray Line, creating American soldiers who are at their very best when the times are at their very worst… Today in honoring you graduates, in celebrating your achievements and giving thanks for your commitment, we can see clearly your role in our world. You graduate the same week that saw the murder of 22 innocent young lives. Manchester’s tragic loss underscores the purpose for your years of study and training at this elite school. For today, as Gen. Caslen said, you join the ranks of those whose mission is to guard freedom and to protect the innocent from such terror, the innocent noted in your class motto, “so others may dream.” We must never permit murderers to define our time or warp our sense of the normal. This is not normal and each of you cadets graduating today are reinforcing the ranks of our army, bringing fresh vigor, renewing our sense of urgency and enhancing the army’s lethality needed to prove our enemies wrong. You will drive home a salient point:  that free men and women will volunteer to fight, ethically and fiercely, to defend our experiment that you and i call, simply, “America.” You graduates, commissioned today, will carry the hopes of your country on your young shoulders. You will now join the ranks of an army at war. Volunteers all, we are so very proud of you cadets, for taking the place you have earned in the unbroken line of patriots who have come before. Your oath of office connects you to the line of soldiers stretching back to the founding of our country…and in the larger sense, it grows from ancient, even timeless roots, reflecting the tone and commitment of youth long ago who believed freedom is worth defending. In terms of serving something larger than yourself, yours is the same oath that was taken by the young men of ancient Athens. They pledged to “fight for the ideals and sacred things of their city…to revere and obey the city’s laws and do [their] best to incite a like respect” in others, and to pass on their city-state “far greater and more beautiful” than they had received it. In that sense, it is fitting the cadet cover you wear today, for the last time, features the helmet of the Greek goddess Athena, echoing respect of the civic duty that’s found in a democracy, and in a nation, in President Lincoln’s words, of the people, by the people, for the people. After four years at west point, you understand what it means to live up to an oath; you understand the commitment that comes with signing a blank check to the American people, payable with your life. My fine young soldiers, a few miles northwest of Washington, D.C. where I work today, at Antietam Battlefield Cemetery is a statue of a union soldier standing at rest, and overlooking his comrades’ graves. It is inscribed with the words, “Not for themselves, but for their country.” How simple that thought. So long as our nation breeds patriots like you, defenders who look past the hot political rhetoric of our day and rally to our flag, that army tradition of serving our country will never die. To a high and remarkable degree, the American people respect you. We in the Department of Defense recognize that there are a lot of passions running about in our country, as there ought to be in a vibrant republic. But for those privileged to wear the cloth of our nation, to serve in the United States Army, you stand the ramparts, unapologetic, apolitical, defending our experiment in self-governance…and you hold the line. You hold the line…faithful to duty…confronting our nation’s foes with implacable will, knowing that if there’s a hill to climb, waiting will not make it any smaller. You hold the line…true to honor…living by a moral code regardless of who is watching, knowing that honor is what we give ourselves for a life of meaning. You hold the line…loyal to country and defending the constitution, defending our fundamental freedoms, knowing from your challenging years here on the Hudson that loyalty only counts where there are a hundred reasons not to be. Behind me, across Lusk Reservoir, stands a memorial dedicated to the American soldier. On it are inscribed the words:  “The lives and destinies of valiant Americans are entrusted to your care and your leadership.” You have been sharpened through one of the finest educational opportunities in America, given to you by the American people via General Caslen’s superb faculty, who expect admirable leadership by example from you as soldier leaders. My view of a great leader is the player-coach. We need coaches, men and women who know themselves, who take responsibility for themselves, coaching their soldiers to be at the top of their game. Every soldier in your platoon will know your name the day you step in front of them. Your responsibility is to know them. Learn their hopes and dreams. Teach them the difference between a mistake and a lack of discipline. If your troops make mistakes, look in the mirror and figure out how to coach them better. And while we will never tolerate a lack of discipline in the U.S. Army, we must not create a zero-defect environment, because that would suffocate initiative and aggressiveness, the two attributes most vital to battlefield success. In leading soldiers, you will have what F. Scott Fitzgerald called, “riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.” So recognize that you should never let your passion for excellence to neutralize your compassion for the soldiers you serve, and who will follow you into harm’s way. Remember that when the chips are down, it will be the spirits of your often rambunctious soldiers that will provide you the reservoir of courage you will need to draw upon. Rest assured that nothing you will face will be worse than Shiloh. Nothing can faze the U.S. Army when our soldiers believe in themselves. The chips were down in the freezing cold days before Christmas, 1944, when the Nazi Army was on the attack in the Ardennes. A sergeant in a retreating tank spotted a fellow American digging a foxhole. The GI, private first class Martin, looked up and said to the sergeant in the tank, “Are you looking for a safe place?” “Yeah,” answered the tanker. “Well, buddy,” the private said with a drawl, “Just pull your vehicle behind me…I’m the 82nd airborne, and this is as far as the bastards are going.” And that is the army that is being entrusted to your care. On the battlefield, my fine young soldiers, no one wins on their own. Teams win battles, and if you can win the trust and affection of your soldiers, they will win all the battles for you. If you wish to be a credit to our nation and to your family, you must carry West Point’s ethos everywhere you go and practice every day the integrity that builds your character. For when destiny taps you on the shoulder and thrusts you into a situation that’s tough beyond words… …when you’re sick and you’ve been three days without sleep… …when you’ve lost some of your beloved troops and the veneer of civilization wears thin, by having lived a disciplined life, you’ll be able to reach inside and find the strength that your country is counting on. Now you are privileged to be embarking on this journey because you’re going to learn things about yourself that others will never know. And we can all, in this stadium today, see the storm clouds gathering. Our enemies are watching. They are calculating and hoping America’s military will turn cynical. That we will lose our selfless spirit. They hope our country no longer produces young people willing to shoulder the patriot’s burden, to willingly face danger and discomfort. By your commitment you will prove the enemy wrong. Dead wrong. We Americans are not made of cotton candy. You are a U.S. soldier, and you hold the line. The class of 2017 now joins an Army that left bloody footprints at Valley Forge…an army that defeated the Nazis’ last gasp at Bastogne… Your class will certainly be remembered for an army football team that took to the field of friendly strife and beat Navy… but you will also be remembered for the history that you’re about to write, and when you turn over your troops to their next commander, they will be as good or better than you received them. Now, I may not have had the pleasure of knowing each of you personally, but I have very high expectations of you… Your country has very high expectations of you… And we are confident you will not let us down because while we may not know you personally, we do know your character, West Point character. So…fight for our ideals and our sacred things …incite in others respect and love for our country and our fellow Americans…and leave this country greater and more beautiful than you inherited it, for that is the duty of every generation. To the families here today, I can only say:  Thank you. Apples don’t fall far from the tree. Thank you for the men and women you raised to become soldiers. And thank you too, old shipmate, General Caslen and your team, who coached these members of the Long Gray Line. They will write the army’s story, and in so doing, they will carry your spirits into our nation’s history. For duty, for honor, for country…hold the line. Congratulations, Class of 2017, and may God bless America. # # # ",U.S. Military Academy Graduation and Commissioning,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1196942/us-military-academy-graduation-and-commissioning/
"Feb. 2, 2018","Minister Poltorak, Ambassador Chaly, members of the delegation, welcome to the Pentagon. It is a pleasure to host you here after our last meeting together in August. I have fond memories of my time in beautiful and historic Kyiv as you celebrated the anniversary of Ukraine’s independence. Since Ukraine regained its true independence in 1991, our two nations have developed a strong partnership dedicated to realizing a prosperous, secure and democratic Ukraine, free from outside coercion for the Ukrainian people to determine their own path to the future. Today, I reiterate our support for the Ukrainian people in the face of threats to your nation’s sovereignty, as Russia seeks to redraw international borders by force, undermining democracy throughout Europe. Ukraine’s determination to stand steadfast along the line of contact gives credence to the words of your national anthem, “soul and body we will lay down for our freedom,” and we honor the continued sacrifice of your soldiers in this conflict. The United States stands with you in pursuit of freedom in the face of Russian aggression. The U.S. will continue to engage Russia to end its violence in eastern Ukraine, withdraw its forces and weapons, and honor both the letter and spirit of its international commitments. Alongside our democratic allies, the United States will continue supporting international norms and the rule of law. I am confident that you will stay the course in pursuit of your ambitious defense reform goals, including continued progress on anti-corruption reforms, as you modernize in accordance with NATO standards, so the world and the Ukrainian people can admire your military’s ethics and effectiveness. The U.S. remains dedicated to developing your military’s defensive capabilities and NATO interoperability as U.S. and allied soldiers from Canada, Lithuania, Poland, and the U.K. continue to train with your forces in western Ukraine. Today, we look forward to discussing pragmatic steps to strengthen further our military-to-military relationship. Mr. Minister – it’s good to host you here. # # # ",Remarks at Bilateral Meeting with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Poltorak,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1432660/remarks-at-bilateral-meeting-with-ukrainian-minister-of-defense-poltorak/
"April 6, 2015","Well, good morning, and thank you so much, Michael. And, good morning, Arizona State, and thank you for being “all in” to national defense.  We appreciate it – we don’t take it for granted.  And it’s good to be here today with you and the institute – the McCain Institute – as I go out on my first trip to Asia as Secretary of Defense, and that’s the topic about which I want to speak with you this morning. Michael, thanks for the kind words.  I’ve heard so much about what you’ve been doing here at ASU, and it’s so great to now have a chance to take a look at it myself.  You are one of the most innovative educators in America.  In transforming ASU with new schools and new research initiatives, realizing the promise of blended learning programs – combining online with in-person instruction.  Doing things like partnering with Starbucks through the Markle Foundation, whose CEO Zoe Baird is with us today.  You have been a leader in expanding access to education and making the American Dream a little easier to achieve for students from all walks of life.  Thank you, Michael. And just as ASU has to simultaneously deliver an excellent education to its current students while pivoting toward – and innovating for – the future of learning, I am also charged with assuring our national security in the here and now – which alone is a consuming job – while ensuring that we also lift our heads up and think about the places and events that will reshape and influence America’s security well into the future. When I wake up every day, first on my mind are the men and women in uniform, deployed all over the world.  I think of course about the very real dangers, current challenges they face – in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, Russian provocation, cyberspace.  And I also think about our budget challenges and our nation’s fiscal health. But I also think about the defining region for our nation’s future – the Asia-Pacific.  I think about this region for so many reasons, but here are a few data points:  And we are seeing very real and astonishing evidence today not just of economic progress, but true social advancement in so many areas in the Asia-Pacific. What many people do not see at first, however, is that all this growth – all this progress – has been the result of a peaceful security environment.  And this peace – unlike in other areas of the world – has not been provided by multilateral alliances like NATO has in Europe.  This miracle of rapid progress, against a backdrop of peace and prosperity, has in fact been enabled by the enduring presence and relationships of the United States – itself an Asia-Pacific nation.  And not just in defense, but in diplomacy, economic policy, commerce, and trade. And as countries across the Asia-Pacific grow more powerful, people become more educated, military spending increases, and economies thrive…we expect to see changes in how countries define and pursue their interests and ambitions.  In other words, the regional status quo will change.  So to secure our enduring interests, and our future that is so closely aligned with the region, we’re changing, too, with our so-called rebalance to the Asia-Pacific. And it’s appropriate that I talk about this region at the McCain Institute. Senator John McCain – whom I just met with here in Phoenix – is an American hero.  He’s an American statesman.  He’s a friend of mine, and he’s a staunch supporter when it comes to the welfare of the troops and reform of the Pentagon, which are priorities of mine also. Twenty years ago, President Clinton was looking for Congressional partners to help normalize the relationship with Vietnam.  Senator McCain had plenty of personal reasons to say no – especially after all he had endured there as a prisoner-of-war.  But he had long realized normalization would help our country move beyond a polarizing conflict and develop new ties with an important country in an increasingly important region. Thanks in part to his effort, today, Vietnam and the United States have overcome years of mistrust to build a positive new relationship.  We’ve established, in fact, a defense relationship with Vietnam that would have been impossible ten years ago.  And this week – just this week…in the waters off Da Nang, a U.S. guided missile destroyer and a littoral combat ship are scheduled to engage with Vietnamese Navy vessels – an engagement under the tactical command, on the part of the U.S. Navy, of a Vietnamese-American U.S. Navy captain, whose family fled from the Vietnam War when he was five years old. And I understand today the Vietnamese Ambassador to the United States is here.  Sir – Ambassador Vinh, thank you for being here. That navy activity in Vietnam is just one small example of America’s recent “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific. I was there with President Obama as he announced the strategic shift that was termed the “rebalance” a few years ago.  The thinking behind it – it’s a long word – but the thinking behind it is fairly short and straight-forward: After ten years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president decided to restore strategic balance across our foreign, economic, and military affairs to revitalize our engagement in the Asia-Pacific…to ensure we did not lose ground in this dynamic and important region. Today, I want to paint the full picture of this renewed investment in the Pacific, and explain why the rebalance matters to Americans – and particularly the younger Americans among you in the audience. Over the past seventy years, America has not only helped heal the wounds of World War II.  We’ve helped create the stability that has allowed people, economies, and countries throughout the Asia-Pacific to make incredible progress.  Think about it.  First, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and now, China and India, have risen and prospered.  Millions of Asians have been lifted into the middle class.  The region has been relatively free of state-on-state conflict.  And democracy has taken hold. The rebalance – in a nut shell – is about sustaining this progress and helping the region continue to fulfill its promise. America’s policy of building stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific has succeeded over the years because it’s been a strong, bipartisan priority through both Democratic and Republican administrations.  The rebalance is working because it’s rooted in the lessons of history, our enduring interests, widespread support in our country, and, especially, our strengths. And our strengths start with our principles, which, as history has shown, are not just principles we hold dear, but they have broad and attractive appeal.  Since 1946, there has been a four-fold increase in the number of democracies in the region.  Following our lead, countries across the Asia-Pacific have also embraced free and open commerce; fidelity to the rule of law; and a rules-based international order. America’s strength is built on our economy, and following one of the hardest recessions in recent memory, the U.S. economy has made great gains – in jobs and in GDP.  And we’re going to continue to make progress because of our dynamic and innovative businesses, our world-leading universities, and the energy revolution underway in our country right now.  And when you combine America’s economy with just those of our Asia-Pacific allies, together we represent $25 trillion of economic might – we and our allies.  That’s a third of the global economy.  And as I will emphasize to you a little later, one critical initiative is before us that would reinforce our economic power.  I’ll come back to that. But America’s strength is also manifest in our military…the finest fighting force the world – and the region – has ever known…because of the unmatched strength of our capabilities, experience, and, above all, our people.  People like the ROTC students you sit next to in class, those who ring the Victory Bell after football games, and the many Sun Devils today, sailing, flying, and serving in the Asia-Pacific right now. Our military maintains world-leading capabilities because we have made incomparable investments over the years.  Since the end of the Cold War, the United States and our allies in the region have invested over $16 trillion in defense.  That’s almost as much as the rest of the world combined spent since 1990, and about ten times more than the next highest spending country, which is China.  The United States spent nearly $4 trillion since 1990 just on research and procurement alone, developing thereby an unmatched capital stock.  And while we face challenges to our technological superiority, it will takes decades – and let me repeat that: decades – for anyone to build the kind of military capability the United States possesses today. This strength is not simply about dollar figures and, above all, about people – it’s also about innovation and the drive to develop revolutionary technologies.  America is unparalleled in our ability to create and innovate, across both the military and commercial sectors.  And we recently launched a major effort, which is one of my top priorities, to develop and field technological breakthroughs that will protect our military’s edge long into the future. The American military has also developed unrivaled – and this is important – operational experience, and honed an unparalleled ability to work with interagency and international partners to fuse intelligence and operate jointly among services and support forces with logistics…all skills forged in the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sharpened in our counter-terror efforts around the world…and also in our humanitarian response to a nuclear meltdown in Japan and a typhoon in the Philippines.  No other military possesses this kind of skill and agility backed by experience. And finally, all these strengths are multiplied by America’s unrivaled network of allies and partners – nations both in the region and around the world who seek our friendship not because of our power alone, or through coercion, but because of the gravitational pull of our ideals, values, and goodwill.  These ties, tended to with careful diplomacy, are what make America’s global strength so unique throughout history and today. The Defense Department will continue to leverage all these strengths in our engagement across the Asia-Pacific because, as one of my good friends and one of our nation’s wisest public servants, Joe Nye, has said, security – security is like oxygen.  When you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  But when you don't have enough, you can think of nothing else.  So, in a region where we’ve enjoyed decades of stability and prosperity, it’s human nature for some in the region to take security for granted.  But we cannot…afford to – and will not – make that mistake. So as Secretary of Defense, I am personally committed to overseeing the next phase of our rebalance, which will deepen and diversify our engagement in the region. First, we will continue to invest in future capabilities that will be especially relevant to the Asia-Pacific’s complex and dynamic security environment.  These include high-end capabilities, such as a new, long-range stealth bomber and a new, long-range anti-ship cruise missile – just to name two…and areas like rapid runway repair, which may seem mundane, but will help ensure that U.S. forces in the region can survive in a crisis.  We’re also working on new weapons like a railgun, which uses electromagnetic forces rather than high explosives to fire rounds at much higher speeds, lower cost, and with greater effectiveness.  And we’re developing new space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities, including some surprising ones. Next, we are now fielding in numbers key capabilities we have developed over the past decade – capabilities that are suited for the Asia-Pacific now and for years to come.  We’ve sent the latest Virginia-class submarine and the Navy’s P-8 surveillance aircraft.  We’re deploying our most advanced fighters in the region – the F-22 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter – as well as our long-range B-2 and B-52 bombers.  And given the region’s growing missile threat, we’re forward deploying two additional Aegis missile defense-equipped ships. We’ll also continue to push our most advanced technology to the Pacific, including, for example, our newest stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt. And we’re finding new ways to use existing weapons systems.  For example, we’ve adapted the Tomahawk missile, best known for use against fixed land-based targets back in the 1991 Gulf War, so it can be used against moving targets in a maritime environment – which is something we think about a lot in the Asia-Pacific. Third, we’re adapting our overall defense posture in the region to be geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.  There is no more concrete example than some of our construction underway around the Asia-Pacific.  For example, in Japan, Korea, and Guam, we’re in the middle of four of the largest military construction projects since the end of the Cold War… and, by the way, our allies in Japan and Korea are stepping up to pay their fair share of the bill for that construction. We’re also being smarter about how we manage our personnel and platforms in the region.  We’re shifting Marines from a concentrated presence on Okinawa to Australia, Hawaii, Guam, and mainland Japan.  We’ve established new agreements to rotate forces to the Philippines and Australia, where our Marines’ fourth rotation is about to begin. And in June, the Army will deploy an Army Brigade Combat Team on its first rotation to Korea – where I’ll be in just a few days…providing a higher readiness force on the Korean peninsula.  We’re also rotating air and naval assets throughout the region. In addition, we’ve maintained out there an increased tempo of training and exercises.  For example, the Army’s Pacific Pathways program has enhanced its training with a number of partners in the region.  And, as we speak, Operation Foal Eagle is underway in Korea, which includes thousands of U.S. and Korean personnel. Everything I just discussed – the investments, the capabilities, and the posture – helps us with our fourth line of effort: which is reinforcing the partnerships and alliances that are the bedrock of everything we do in the Asia-Pacific. That begins with constantly refreshing our long-standing alliances – as we have done since their origin back in the Cold War – to reflect the new strategic environment.  When I get to Japan later this week, we will be working to complete a new set of Guidelines on Defense Cooperation – which is the foundational guidance for this important alliance – to allow us to take our cooperation to a whole new level and into new areas like space and cyberspace.  In Korea, I’ll be working with my counterpart to reinforce deterrence and improve capabilities on the Peninsula to counteract an increasingly dangerous and provocative North Korea. To expand the reach of our alliances, we are building unprecedented “trilateral” cooperation – in other words, we’re networking our relationships.  With Japan and Australia, for example, we’re cooperating to strengthen maritime security in Southeast Asia and explore defense technology cooperation.  And with Japan and Korea, we’re building on a first-of-its-kind information-sharing arrangement that will help us collectively deter and respond to crises. We’re also establishing new partnerships – brand new partnerships – while deepening others…especially in South and Southeast Asia.  I mentioned our growing relationship with Vietnam earlier, but this June I will also return to Singapore for the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, and travel on to Southeast Asia and India. The U.S.-India relationship is one of our most exciting and dynamic partnerships.  In January, we agreed to an update of our bilateral Defense Framework…which is the first update in ten years with this country of growing importance.  It will open up new ways to expand the U.S.-India relationship, such as maritime security, and new opportunities to cooperate on high-end technologies, for example, jet engines and aircraft carrier design. In Southeast Asia, we are enhancing the capabilities of our partners as they step up and play leading roles on a range of challenges.  That’s why we are partnering with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia to provide them with additional assets for maritime security and disaster relief operations.  And why we’re helping Singapore develop a regional information sharing and disaster relief hub. Okay, so what about China?  How does it fit into this strategy?  Some people would have you believe that China will displace America in the Asia-Pacific or that its economic growth will somehow squeeze out opportunities for young people like you.  But I reject the zero-sum thinking that China’s gain is our loss because there is another scenario in which everyone wins…and it is a continuation of the decades of peace and stability anchored by a strong American role, in which all Asia-Pacific countries continue to rise and prosper, including China.  This is the scenario we seek in the ongoing rebalance. That said, we and many other countries are deeply concerned about some of the activities China is undertaking.   Its opaque defense budget…its actions in cyberspace…and its behavior in places like the South and East China Seas raise a number of serious questions.   These are concerns we raise with our Chinese counterparts on a regular basis. The U.S. and China are not allies, but we don’t have to be adversaries.  A strong, constructive U.S.-China relationship is essential for global security and prosperity.   Our relationship will be complex as we continue to both compete and cooperate.  But we also believe there are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China, which is why President Obama and President Xi announced two historic confidence-building agreements this past fall.  We’re working to complete another measure this year that aims to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters, and there are a wide range of other possible confidence-building measures that I will be strongly working on. Assuring peace, prosperity, and progress as countries across the Asia-Pacific continue to rise will be your generation’s central strategic challenge.  The rebalance is helping create the right incentives and conditions to encourage China to play by the rules of a principled international order…one that has helped China – as much as any other nation – rise and prosper. But look, I’m sure that as some of you approach graduation, your own prosperity is foremost on your minds – and probably your parents’ too.  Know this: a growing Asia-Pacific is an enormous opportunity for you and for the country. Whether you are a doctor or an engineer, an entrepreneur or an artist, a software designer or, like me, a physics major and medieval history major, the arithmetic is straightforward: 95 percent of the world’s customers – for the cures you discover, the software you develop, and the articles you write – live beyond our borders.  There are already more than 525 million middle class consumers in Asia, and we expect there to be 3.2 billion in the region by 2030. President Obama and I want to ensure that you and the rest of America’s workers and businesses can successfully compete for all these potential customers.  That is why we need Congress to pass bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority for the President – so that he can ensure America gets the best deal in a historic, new trade agreement with eleven other Asia-Pacific countries, which is called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As Secretary of Defense, I never forget that our military strength ultimately rests on the foundation of our vibrant, unmatched, and growing economy.  TPP is so important because of its enormous promise for jobs and growth across our nation’s economy.  It is expected to increase U.S. exports by $125 billion in the next decade, supporting high quality jobs.  TPP also, by the way, makes economic sense here in Arizona because exports already support almost 100,000 Arizona jobs. TPP would provide these businesses – and all of us – a more level playing field and more opportunities to succeed.  It would do so by requiring these other countries to adopt the standards that we hold ourselves to here in the United States, such as: government transparency, intellectual property laws, a free and open internet, environmental protections, and workers’ rights.  TPP would also lower barriers to American goods and services in the Asia-Pacific’s fastest growing markets. But TPP also makes strong strategic sense, and it is probably one of the most important parts of the rebalance, and that’s why it has won such bipartisan support.  In fact, you may not expect to hear this from a Secretary of Defense, but in terms of our rebalance in the broadest sense, passing TPP is as important to me as another aircraft carrier.  It would deepen our alliances and partnerships abroad and underscore our lasting commitment to the Asia-Pacific.  And it would help us promote a global order that reflects both our interests and our values. Time’s running out: we already see countries in the region trying to carve up these markets…forging many separate trade agreements in recent years, some based on pressure and special arrangements rather than openness and principle.  Agreements that don’t incorporate our high standards and leave us on the sidelines.  That risks America’s access to these growing markets, and it risks regional instability. We must all decide if we are going to let that happen.  If we’re going to help boost our exports and our economy, support higher-paying jobs across America, and cement our influence and leadership in the fastest-growing region in the world; or if, instead, we’re going to take ourselves out of the game. As Secretary of Defense, I see our military personnel demonstrate every day that American men and women, American innovation, and American hard work do not just compete, they outpace every other country in the world.  By passing Trade Promotion Authority and finalizing a strong TPP, we’ll allow American workers to do the same. At the end of this trip, I hope to see one of those service members … your fellow Sun Devil Air Force Captain Cody Chiles.  Cody, after graduating from ASU in 2007, went on to serve in, among other places, Korea and Japan, before his current assignment in Hawaii, where I hope to meet him at the end of my trip.  In every assignment he’s had throughout the region, he believes that he and his fellow service members have been America’s “statesmen” in the Asia- Pacific. Over the next century, no region will matter more for American security and also for American prosperity.   That’s the world we will be living in.  And, thanks to President Obama’s leadership, the United States is poised economically, diplomatically, and militarily to embrace all of its opportunities. But we need people like you and Cody to represent us in the region.  While you may not serve in the military, you can be Sun Devil-Statesmen just like him. You and your generation are our best representatives, and that is why I’ve been honored to speak to you today.  You will have an amazing education thanks to ASU and to your hard work.  And you’re the reason I feel so hopeful about America’s future – at home, in the Asia-Pacific, and around the world. Thank you.

"Feb. 13, 2015","To the men and women of the Department of Defense: When I joined the United States Army 48 years ago, I could not have imagined one day serving as secretary of Defense. It has been a tremendous privilege to serve with you. As I leave office, I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished together over the past two years. We have responsibly ended our combat operations in Afghanistan and begun the follow-on mission to preserve our achievements there. We have bolstered enduring alliances and strengthened emerging partnerships, while successfully responding to crises around the world. We have launched vital reforms that will prepare this institution for the challenges of the future. We have fought hard - and made real progress - against the scourge of sexual assault in our ranks. And after 13 years of war, we have worked to restore our military readiness and ease the burdens on our people and their families. Through it all, many of you, and your families, coped with shutdowns and furloughs; weathered hiring and pay freezes; and endured long hours and longer deployments. You did so because we each took an oath to defend our nation, our fellow citizens, and our way of life. And you have lived up to your word. But as you know well, the world is still too dangerous, and threats too numerous. I know you will remain vigilant, continuing your important work under the leadership of Ash Carter. A special note to our men and women in uniform: of all the many opportunities my life has given me, I am most proud of having once been a soldier. The lessons from my time in uniform about trust, responsibility, duty, judgment, and loyalty - I have carried these with me throughout my life. As your secretary of Defense, I have seen those same traits in each of you. Whether you serve in uniform or as a civilian, you are the reason why our military is the finest in the world and the most admired and most trusted institution in America. Nothing has clarified my thinking, nothing has renewed my hope, and nothing has made me prouder than getting to know, work, and serve with so many of you who have put the nation's interest above your own. If I had any parting guidance, it would be the same reminder that my drill sergeant, Sgt. 1st Class William Joyce, gave to me after I finished basic training in 1967: ""People depend on you. They'll always depend on you."" That was true for me then, and it is true for all of you today. People depend on you - America depends on you - to live up to your oath, to conduct yourselves in keeping with our highest standards, and to perform as the greatest military the world has ever known. After two years serving with you, I am confident you will continue to do so. You and your families have my deepest gratitude and admiration. Thank you for your unflagging service and your commitment to this country. May God bless America and each and every one of you. ",Farewell Message to the Department of Defense From Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606644/farewell-message-to-the-department-of-defense-from-secretary-of-defense-chuck-h/
"July 20, 2016","Good morning, my friends.  It’s very good to see you.  We have here represented all – every single member – of the international coalition to combat ISIL – almost all of them represented at the ministerial level, the defense minister level.  And I’m very grateful for each and every one of you for taking the time to be here, and travel the distance that you did.  It’s good to see so many friends around this table.  And this is a time – this is a very important time for us to meet, and it’s an important time to show our solidarity as friends. Thanks to this global coalition, our clear and deliberate military campaign plan, our dedicated local partner forces, and the sacrifices of our militaries’ members, we now have momentum in this fight and we have clear results on the ground.  And today, we’ll make the plans and commitments that will help us deliver ISIL a lasting defeat – the defeat it deserves.  We’re going to destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology. Our coalition’s military campaign plan, as you all know, has three objectives.  The first is to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  That’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient.  As recent attacks in our homelands remind us, ISIL’s safe havens threaten not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian people, but also the security of our citizens in other countries.  And the sooner we defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria, the safer our countries will be. So we have a second objective also, which is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around the world.  And we have a third and very important mission, which is to help protect our homeland, along with law enforcement and intelligence officials. Now, in January of this year, we all – those of us at this table – updated our comprehensive Coalition Military Campaign Plan to meet those three objectives.  Our campaign’s strategic approach is to identify and enable capable and motivated local forces who can deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  Only local forces can deliver and sustain such a defeat, by holding and governing territory after it has been retaken from ISIL. And we’ve pursued a number of deliberate decisions and actions to accelerate this plan and hasten ISIL’s defeat. This time last year, we put our coalition military campaign plan for Iraq and Syria under one single command, charging Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland as the overall operational commander.  Then we introduced a series of initial accelerants to help us gather momentum.  And of course, we asked all our coalition countries to make additional contributions to the campaign, and you did. As we did so, we also set in motion a series of specific and deliberate steps through the winter, the spring, and now in the summer – the first plays in the game, as President Obama called them – that we would accomplish as soon as possible to put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  And since then – play by play, town after town, from every direction, and in every domain – our campaign has accelerated further, squeezing ISIL and rolling it back towards Raqqa and Mosul.  We’re isolating those two cities and effectively setting the stage to collapse ISIL’s control over them. We see that on the ground.  In Iraq, as I saw firsthand last week during my most recent visit there, we’re enabling the dedicated Iraqi Security Forces and the Peshmerga led by Prime Minister Abadi and supported by Kurdish Regional President Barzani.  And after clearing Ramadi and establishing a staging base in Makhmur, the Iraqi Security Forces moved on to liberate Hit, Rutbah, and Fallujah.  Then early last week, they seized the strategically important Qayyarah West airfield, which is a critical logistical springboard for the effort to collapse ISIL’s control of Mosul. And in Syria, we’re also seeing results.  After seizing Shaddadi – a crucial junction on the road between Mosul and Raqqa – our partners on the ground have now surrounded Manbij City, which is one of the last junctions connecting Raqqa to the outside world and a key transit point for external plotters threatening the homelands. We’ve also been pressuring ISIL by systematically eliminating their key leaders and their financial base.  In addition to taking out key ISIL ministers and capturing one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, we’ve killed over 20 of ISIL’s external operators who were actively plotting to attack our homelands and our personnel.  And wherever our local partners have moved – whether in Anbar, Ninewah, or Manbij – we’ve taken out ISIL’s field commanders.  Meanwhile, we’re continuing attacks on ISIL’s economic infrastructure – from oil wells and trucks to cash storage sites.  And we’re taking the fight to ISIL across all domains, including cyber. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of our local partners and our servicemembers, and additional, timely coalition contributions from those gathered here, we’ve seized opportunities, reinforced success, and taken the fight to the enemy. But we must not rest.  We need to make the plans and the commitments to build on our momentum and deliver ISIL’s lasting defeat.   Today, we need to review – and agree on – the next plays in our campaign, which General Votel, who’s doing an extraordinary job on this campaign, will walk us through on a map, and we’ll discuss them in detail.  And then we’ll identify the capabilities and the support required to execute those next plays. Since February, our nations, including the United States, have provided even more support to accelerate the campaign, as our local partners have made advances.  In fact, two-thirds of our coalition members have pledged or already made additional military contributions since then, while many other members and nations have contributed vital economic, political, and humanitarian support. But we’re all going to need to do more.  Today, we’ll identify both our enduring and emerging requirements and review our detailed metrics matrix of national contributions, which you’ve seen before – going through it row by row, column and column, and country by country.  We must ensure that our partners on the ground have what they need to win and fight and then hold, rebuild, and govern their territory. This last point, the need to ensure that our economic and political campaigns do not lag behind our military progress – do not lag behind our military progress – is critical and a significant strategic priority.  We’ll discuss it today, and then again tomorrow at the State Department with our Foreign Minister colleagues. Of course, as I said earlier, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient.  ISIL’s influence and activities continue to pose a threat – in Afghanistan, where I was last week, as well as in Libya, and elsewhere.  Today, we’ll also discuss how we can continue to combat ISIL wherever it might attempt to take hold, and how our military campaign can best support our national governments’ efforts to protect our respective homelands and our people. That’s a full agenda and this is a critical moment, and today is an important opportunity to build on our momentum and deliver ISIL a lasting defeat. Before we begin our discussions, let me ask my friend and colleague, French Minister of Defense Jean-Yves Le Drian, to make a few opening comments as well. Jean-Yves, you have been a great leader, a critical partner, a strong leader, and a staunch ally in this fight.  I want to offer again my condolences to the French people and the French government for your nation’s losses in last week’s attack in Nice, our total solidarity with the French people, and our admiration for your strong personal leadership.  The floor is yours, Jean-Yves. Thank you. ",Opening Remarks at Counter-ISIL Defense Minister Meeting,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/850519/opening-remarks-at-counter-isil-defense-minister-meeting/
"July 4, 2014","As we celebrate Independence Day, I want to express my gratitude to the men and women and their families who serve our nation at home and abroad.  Thank you for all you do to help keep America safe. When the Declaration of Independence was signed 238 years ago, 56 patriots pledged their lives and their sacred honor to defend our inviolable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  They left a legacy that lives on today through generations of Americans who have made that same pledge to boldly stand up against tyranny, oppression, and persecution.  Their devotion to duty is just as strong, as is their willingness to risk their lives for each other and our country. Those who serve in our armed forces, and their families, have given so much to defend the ideals and free institutions we often take for granted.  Their dedication reminds us that preserving America’s liberties comes with a heavy cost.  Today, as we celebrate our nation’s birth, let us honor their service and strive to be worthy of their tremendous sacrifices. God bless you, our great nation, and all who endeavor to defend it.  Happy Fourth of July!

"May 6, 2015","Chairman Cochran, Vice Chairman Durbin, Members of the Committee:  thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget request for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Oversight is key to our system of government.  I not only welcome your wisdom and experience; I also want your partnership, and need your help. I also want to thank Chairman Dempsey for his leadership, as well as Deputy Secretary Work and Vice Chairman Winnefeld, in particular for all their hard work over the past year in helping develop the budget request we will be discussing today.  I. INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY Shortly after I was sworn in 11 weeks ago, I spoke to the people of the Department of Defense – military, civilian, and contractor – and told them I had three commitments as Secretary of Defense. The first is to them and their families – to safeguard them, to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect, and above all to ensure that when they are sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care. The second commitment is to the President – to offer him my best strategic advice as he faces a complex world, to ensure at the same time that he receives candid military advice, and to see that his decisions are carried out with DoD’s expected excellence. And my third commitment is to the future – to ensure our military remains the very best in an ever-changing world, amid fast-moving technological and commercial change, and as we seek to attract new generations to the mission of national security. To meet those commitments, I have since traveled to Afghanistan, Kuwait, Japan, and South Korea to meet with our troops, commanders, and allies in those countries.  I also released DoD’s new cyber strategy, launched the next phase of our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to ridding our ranks of sexual assault, approved new U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, and outlined my vision for how people, technology, and innovation will contribute to our force of the future. Everything I have done since taking office has reaffirmed for me that in every region of the world, in every domain – air, land, sea, space, and in cyberspace – it is America’s leadership, and America’s men and women in uniform, who stand between disorder and order – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing with those who believe in a more secure, just, and prosperous future for all our children. Mr. Chairman, this committee and this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so – whether they can continue to defend our nation’s interests around the world with the readiness, capability, and excellence our nation has grown accustomed to, and sometimes taken for granted. Halting and reversing the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. It would ensure we field a modern, ready force in a balanced way, while also embracing change and reform, because asking for more taxpayer dollars requires we hold up our end of the bargain – by ensuring that every dollar is well-spent. The President is proposing to increase the defense budget in Fiscal Year 2016, but in line with the projection he submitted to Congress last year in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget’s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The department is executing the plan it presented last year.  Accordingly, for Fiscal Year 2016, the President is proposing $534 billion for DoD’s base budget and $51 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), totaling $585 billion to sustain America’s national security and defense strategies. The Defense Department needs your support for this budget, which is driven by strategy, not the other way around.  More specifically, it is driven by the defense strategy identified in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which reflects the longtime, bipartisan consensus that our military must protect the homeland, build security globally, and project power and win decisively.  We do so in line with our longstanding tradition of maintaining a superior force with an unmatched technological edge, working in close partnership with friends and allies, upholding the rules-based international order, and keeping our commitments to the people who make up the all-volunteer force. Our defense budget’s priorities line up with our strategic priorities:  sustaining America’s global leadership by:  This budget ensures we can execute our defense strategy with manageable risk, even as it does require us to accept elevated risk in some areas. But – and I want to be clear about this – parts of our nation’s defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration, which remains the law of the land and is set to return 148 days from today. As I have said before, the prospect of sequestration’s serious damage to our national security and economy is tragically not a result of an economic emergency or recession. It is not because these budget cuts are a mathematical solution to the nation’s overall fiscal challenge – they are not. It is not because paths of curbing nondiscretionary spending and reforming our tax system have been explored and exhausted – they have not. It is not due to a breakthrough in military technology or a new strategic insight that somehow makes continued defense spending unnecessary – there has been no such silver bullet. And it is not because the world has suddenly become more peaceful – for it is abundantly clear that it has not. Instead, sequestration is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.  And friends and potential enemies around the world are watching. We in the Department of Defense are prepared to make difficult strategic and budgetary choices.  We are also committed – more than ever before – to finding new ways to improve the way we do business and be more efficient and accountable in our defense spending. But in order to ensure our military remains the world’s finest fighting force, we need to banish the clouds of fiscal uncertainty that have obscured our plans and forced inefficient choices.  We need a long-term restoration of normal budgeting and a deal that the President can sign, and that lives up to our responsibility of defending this country and the global order.  And that means, among other things, avoiding sequestration. To be sure, even under sequestration, America will remain the world’s strongest military power.  But under sequestration, our military – and our national security – would have to take on irresponsible and unnecessary risk – risk that previous Administrations and Congressional leaders have wisely chosen to avoid. Sequestration would lead over time to a military that looks fundamentally different and performs much differently than what we are used to.  Not only as Secretary of Defense, but simply as an American, I deeply, earnestly hope we can avert that future.  I am committed to working with the members of this committee, and your colleagues throughout the Congress to prevent it. I know how proud you and all Americans are that we field the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  But our military superiority was not built, and will not be sustained, by resting on our laurels.  So instead of resigning ourselves to having the diminished military that sequestration would give us, I propose that we build the force of the future, together.  II. BUILDING THE FORCE OF THE FUTURE Assuming the Congress funds the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget and averts sequestration, we have the opportunity to build the force of the future.  We have inherited a long tradition of military excellence from those who came before us, and we must preserve it for those who will come after. But to do so, DoD must embrace the future – and embrace change – throughout our institution.  We at the Pentagon must, as I say, think outside our five-sided box,and be open to new ideas and new ways of doing business that can help us operate more efficiently and perform more effectively in an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment. As DoD counters the very real dangers we face in the world, we will also grab hold of the bright opportunities before us – opportunities to be more competitive and re-forge our nation’s military and defense establishment into a future force that harnesses and develops the latest, cutting-edge technology, and that remains superior to any potential adversary; one that is efficient and accountable to the taxpayers who support it; and one that competes and succeeds in attracting the next generation of talented Americans to fill its ranks. These are the three main pillars on which DoD will build the force of the future. Competitiveness through Technological and Operational Superiority As other nations pursue comprehensive military modernization programs and develop technologies designed to blunt our military’s traditional advantages, the first pillar of our future force must be ensuring that we maintain – and extend – our technological edge over any potential adversary. The President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget includes targeted investments in modernized space, cyber, and missile defense capabilities geared toward countering emerging threats that could upend our technological superiority and our ability to project power.  DoD would look forward to providing a full account of our proposed modernization investments, and the threats that compel them, in a classified setting. The budget also supports the Defense Innovation Initiative, which will help ensure the military continues to ride the leading edge of innovation, and makes deferred modernization investments that will ensure America’s nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective.  Across all these efforts, we must be open to global, commercial technology as well, and learn from advances in the private sector.  That’s why, less than two weeks ago at Stanford University, I outlined some first steps we are taking to be more open, rebuild bridges, and renew trust between the Pentagon and the tech community – such as establishing a DoD branch of the U.S. Digital Service, creating a new Defense Innovation Unit (Experimental) to be located in Silicon Valley, expanding and improving the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and developing a pilot project with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel to provide innovative solutions to our most challenging problems. Because we know that technology alone – however advanced – cannot sustain our military’s superiority, just as important is a ruthless focus on operational excellence.  This means using our existing forces and capabilities in new, creative, and fiscally prudent ways to achieve our objectives.  This also means working to develop more innovative and effective strategic and military options for the President, introducing a new and more rapidly responsive global force management model, developing new operational concepts, and reforming and updating all our operational plans. Competitiveness through Accountability & Efficiency The second pillar of building the force of the future requires redoubling our efforts to make DoD more accountable and efficient.  We live in a competitive world and need to be a competitive organization.  If we don’t lean ourselves out and maintain our fighting weight, we have no business asking our fellow citizens for more resources. As I made clear in my confirmation hearing, I cannot suggest greater support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is always spent as well as it should be. American taxpayers rightly have trouble comprehending – let alone supporting – the defense budget when they read of cost overruns, insufficient accounting and accountability, needless overhead, and the like. If we’re asking taxpayers to not only give us half a trillion of their hard-earned dollars, but also give us more than we got last year, we have to demonstrate that we can be responsible with it.  We must do all we can to spend their money more wisely and more responsibly.  We must reduce overhead, and we must curb wasteful spending practices wherever they are. DoD has sought to continuously improve our acquisition processes over the past five years, and I am proud myself to have been a part of that effort.  Today, I am recommitting the Defense Department to working both with Congress, and on our own, to find new and more creative ways of stretching our defense dollars to give our troops the weapons and equipment they need. The department’s Better Buying Power initiative is now on its third iteration since I established it in 2010, with Better Buying Power 3.0 focused on achieving dominant capabilities through technical excellence.  I know well and very much appreciate the strong support for acquisition reform demonstrated by members of both the Senate and House, and I share their deep desire to achieve real, lasting results that benefit both America’s security and taxpayers. DoD is working closely with Senate and House Armed Services committee members and staff on ways to eliminate some of the burdensome and duplicative administrative requirements levied on our program managers.  To that end, the President’s FY 2016 budget submission includes a number of legislative proposals designed to help streamline the program oversight process.  We look forward to continuing our close partnership with Congress to see these measures implemented. As we sustain our focus on acquisition reform, I believe that DoD must concurrently undertake a wholesale review of our business practices and management systems. Our goal is to identify where we can further reduce the cost of doing business to free up funding for readiness and modernization – ensuring that our energy, focus, and resources are devoted to supporting our frontline operations as much as possible. We intend to work closely with industry partners – who execute or enable many of our programs, logistics, training, administrative, and other functions – throughout this process, both to explore how they could help us accomplish our missions at reduced cost, and because they may have new and innovative ideas worth considering. Additionally, the Defense Department is pursuing creative force structure changes to be more agile and efficient – such as how we’re modernizing our cruisers and restructuring Army aviation.  We’ve established a new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.  And four previous rounds of efficiency and budget reduction initiatives have yielded approximately $78 billion in projected and actual savings in FY 2016, helping to cushion our defense programs from successive years of budget cuts. We’re also working hard to cut unnecessary overhead: from reducing management headquarters budgets by 20 percent across the department, to divesting excess bases and infrastructure. When DoD recently requested a round of domestic Base Realignment and Closure, Congress asked that we first pursue efficiencies in Europe.  We did.  DoD has approved and is pursuing a broad European Infrastructure Consolidation – which will result in some $500 million in annual recurring savings.  We now need a round of domestic BRAC beginning in Fiscal Year 2017 to address excess infrastructure here at home. Simply put, we have more bases in more places than we need.  We estimate DoD has about 25 percent more infrastructure capacity than necessary.  We must be permitted to divest surplus infrastructure as we reduce and renew force structure.  With projected recurring savings from a new BRAC round totaling some $2 billion a year, it would be irresponsible to cut tooth without also cutting tail. For base communities in question, it’s important to remember that BRAC is often an opportunity to be seized.  Communities have shown that BRAC is ultimately what you make of it, and there are plenty of places that have emerged from it stronger than they were before. Consider Lawrence, Indiana, which took advantage of Fort Harrison’s closure in 1996 to create an enterprise zone, community college, recreational facilities, and commercial sites that in just 7 years not only replaced 100 percent of the jobs lost when the base closed, but created even more. Charleston, South Carolina stepped up when the Charleston Naval Complex closed in 1993, and now is home to more than 80 new industrial and federal agency tenants.  The former naval base is now producing millions of dollars’ worth of goods that are exported to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. And at former Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, the local redevelopment effort has invested $400 million and created more than 6,500 jobs – over six times the number of jobs lost when the base closed in 1993.  It’s now home to scores of businesses, a mixture of private companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. These are just a few examples of what can happen when local leaders, communities, and businesses work together and take advantage of the opportunities for new jobs and new growth after BRAC. One more point on accountability:  Whether we’re improving acquisition or closing bases, it is not enough to simply tell taxpayers that we’re spending their dollars responsibly.  We have to also show them, which is why good cost accounting and financial auditability is so important to me. DoD has made significant progress over the past five years in adding more discipline to our business environment, but there is much work left to be done, and we remain fully committed to our audit goals. Today, over 90 percent of DoD’s current year, general fund budgetary resources are under some form of financial audit, with the Army, Navy, and Air Force now under audit and following the model employed by the Marine Corps. We plan to submit every corner of DoD to this kind of audit regimen beginning in FY 2016.  With this foundation, the department will progressively expand the scope of these audits until all our organizations, funds, and financial statements will be under audit in FY 2018.  I intend to do everything I can – including holding people to account – to get this done. Competitiveness through Attracting Future Talent Third, but no less important, DoD must be competitive when it comes to attracting new generations of talented and dedicated Americans to our calling of defending the nation. We know how the attacks of September 11th, 2001 motivated so many Americans to want to be part of this noble endeavor.  Going forward, we must ensure our future force can continue to recruit the finest young men and women our country has to offer – military and civilian – like those who serve today. As we do this, we must be mindful that the next generation expects jobs that give them purpose, meaning, and dignity.  They want to be able to make real contributions, have their voices heard, and gain valuable and transferable experience.  We must shape the kind of force they want to be in.  The battle for talent will demand enlightened and agile leaders, new training schemes, new educational opportunities, and new compensation approaches. DoD is already pursuing several initiatives that will help ensure the military is a compelling career option and improve how we recruit, retain, and transition both current and future generations of talented Americans.  In recent years, we’ve been expanding pilot programs that facilitate breaks in service that let our people gain diverse work experience.  We’ve tailored our transition assistance program, Transition GPS, to better prepare servicemembers to enter the civilian workforce – providing different tracks for those who want to go to college, those who want skills training, and those who want to be entrepreneurs.  And we’ve put a renewed focus on military ethics and professionalism, as well as making sure our military health system is held to the same high-quality standards we expect from the servicemembers and military family members under its care. And we’re going to keep doing more, because we have to compete if we’re going to succeed. As I recently told students at my former high school in Abington, Pennsylvania, today’s young Americans are a great fit for the U.S. military and a great fit for what we do, but because our mission is so important and since our people are at the heart of it, we’re exploring new ideas that will make us an even better fit for new generations like theirs.  For example, we’re looking at ways to increase the permeability of the wall between the government and young people working in the private sector, so we can bring in more highly-skilled people in areas like cyber.  We’re looking at how we can provide personnel with more flexibility and choice in their careers, and improve how we evaluate and promote people based on performance and merit.  And we’re making sure that we prepare our people to think through their next steps after military service from the day they arrive here, so that they’re all primed for success in whatever they decide to do next. Because we know how important it is – both for today’s servicemembers and the generation that will follow them – we’re also deeply committed to creating an environment and culture where we live the values we defend and every servicemember is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. That’s why we’re continuing to expand combat positions available to women – because everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country should have full and equal opportunity to do so. It’s why we’re striving to eliminate sexual assault from the military – because as I recently told local ROTC cadets and midshipmen at Georgetown University and some of our sexual assault first responders at Fort Myer, no man or woman who serves in the United States military should ever be sexually assaulted. And it’s why we’ve been making sure gay and lesbian servicemembers can serve openly, and that their families receive the benefits their loved ones have earned. But for everything we’re doing, DoD cannot build the force of the future by ourselves.  We need Congress’s help. What We Need Congress To Do Since our current defense budget drawdown began several years ago, I’ve observed something of a phenomenon here in Washington. Along with our troops, their families, and our defense civilians, I thank our supporters on Capitol Hill, including most members of this committee, who have joined with us in trying to do everything possible to get Congress to prevent more mindless cuts to our defense budget. Unfortunately, these combined efforts have been unsuccessful in actually restoring adequate and predictable resources for DoD.  We have had to endure deep cuts to readiness, weather pay freezes and civilian furloughs, and cut badly needed investments in modernization and critical technologies.  At the same time, Congress has sometimes sought to protect programs that DoD has argued are no longer needed, or require significant reform. We have had the worst of both worlds – a double whammy of mindless sequestration coupled with inability to reform. As many of you know, it wasn’t always this way. During the defense drawdown after the Cold War, DoD had much more flexibility thanks to the help of Congress.  For example, we were able to resize the Army, retire the A-6 Intruder and many other weapons systems, and implement multiple BRAC rounds, which freed up dollars we re-allocated to keep our force structure ready, capable, and deployable around the world. I know some of the changes and reforms we’re proposing may feel like a significant change from how we currently do business.  But if anyone can understand how the dots connect and how we need Congress’s help to be able to defend our country, our allies, and our interests in an increasingly dangerous world, it’s you – the members of this committee. The fact is, if we’re not able to implement the changes and reforms we need, we will be forced to make painful tradeoffs, even at the higher topline the President is requesting.  We will lose further ground on modernization and readiness – leaving tomorrow’s force less capable and leaving our nation less secure.  And we will face significant hurdles to executing our nation’s defense strategy.  That’s why we need your help.  III. THE PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET As we do every year when formulating our budget, this budget seeks to balance readiness, capability, and size – because we must ensure that, whatever the size of our force, we have the resources to provide every servicemember with the right training, the right equipment, the right compensation, and the right quality of fellow troops.  That is the only way we can ensure our military is fully prepared to accomplish its missions. Almost two-thirds of DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 base budget – $348.4 billion – funds our day-to-day expenses, similar to what a business would call its operating budget.  This covers, among other expenses, the cost of fuel, spare parts, logistics support, maintenance, service contracts, and administration.  It also includes pay and benefits for military and civilian personnel, which by themselves comprise nearly half of our total budget. The remaining third of our base budget – $185.9 billion – comprises investments in future defense needs, much like a business’ capital improvement budget.  It pays for the research, development, testing, evaluation, and ultimately acquisition of the weapons, equipment, and facilities that our servicemembers need. Broken down differently, our base budget includes the following categories:  Modernization What makes this budget different is the focus it puts, more so than any other over the last decade, on new funding for modernization.  After years of war, which required the deferral of longer-term modernization investments, this budget puts renewed emphasis on preparing for future threats – especially threats that challenge our military’s power projection capabilities. Threats to Power Projection and our Technological Edge Being able to project power anywhere across the globe by rapidly surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies lies at the core of our defense strategy and what the American people have come to expect of their military.  It guarantees that when an acute crisis erupts anywhere in the world, America can provide aid when disaster strikes, reinforce our allies when they are threatened, and protect our citizens and interests globally.  It also assures freedom of navigation and overflight, and allows global commerce to flow freely. For decades, U.S. global power projection has relied on the ships, planes, submarines, bases, aircraft carriers, satellites, networks, and other advanced capabilities that comprise our military’s unrivaled technological edge.  But today that superiority is being challenged in unprecedented ways. Advanced military technologies, from rockets and drones to chemical and biological capabilities, have found their way into the arsenals of both non-state actors as well as previously less capable militaries.  And other nations – among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea – have been pursuing long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap that has long existed between them and the United States. These modernization programs are developing and fielding advanced aircraft, submarines, and both longer-range and more accurate ballistic and cruise missiles.  They’re developing new and advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles, as well as new counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities.  In some areas, we see levels of new weapons development that we haven’t seen since the mid-1980s, near the peak of the Soviet Union’s surge in Cold War defense spending. Targeted Investments in the President’s Budget One of the reasons we are asking for more money this year than last year is to reverse recent under-investment in new weapons systems by making targeted investments to help us stay ahead of emerging threats – adding substantial funding for space control and launch capabilities, missile defense, cyber, and advanced sensors, communications, and munitions – all of which are critical for power projection in contested environments.  The $70 billion we’re requesting for research and development is essential to help build the world’s most advanced fighters and bombers, develop new phased arrays for radar, and produce the satellites, missiles, and ships that let us strike terrorists in the Middle East and underwrite stability in the Asia-Pacific. The budget also makes significant investments in the resilience and survivability of our infrastructure and forces, particularly in the western Pacific, with improved active defenses such as our Patriot and AEGIS systems, as well as selective hardening of key installations and facilities. DoD is also addressing the erosion of U.S. technological superiority with the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII).  The DII is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century. The DII will identify, develop, and field breakthrough technologies and systems through a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program, and the President’s budget supports this effort through specific investments in promising new technologies and capabilities such as high-speed strike weapons, advanced aeronautics, rail guns, and high energy lasers.  The DII also involves the development of innovative operational concepts that would help us use our current capabilities in new and creative ways – like adapting our Tomahawk missiles to be used against moving targets in a maritime environment, or using smart projectiles that can be fired from many of our existing land- and ship-based artillery guns to defeat incoming missiles at much lower cost per round.  The ultimate aim is to help craft ‘offset strategies’ that maximize our strengths and exploit the weaknesses of potential adversaries. Our budget is also making focused and sustained investments in modernization and manning across the nuclear enterprise, even as we reduce the roles and numbers of nuclear weapons in the U.S. nuclear posture.  These investments are critical for ensuring the continued safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, as well as the long-term health of the force that supports our nuclear triad, particularly after recent troubling lapses in parts of DoD’s nuclear enterprise.  To help fund improvements across the nuclear enterprise, we are requesting an increase of approximately $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016, and about $8 billion over the FYDP. Readiness DoD must rebuild and recover after more than 13 years of uninterrupted war.  But our effort to do so has been frustrated by two variables, both of which are out of our hands – one, the continued high operational tempo and high demand for our forces, and two, the uncertainty surrounding annual appropriations. Only over the last couple of years has readiness begun to recover from the strains of over a decade of war, exacerbated by sequestration in 2013.  Nevertheless, readiness remains at troubling levels across the force. While our forward-deployed forces remain ready, our surge forces at home are not as ready as they need to be.  The President’s budget therefore invests in near-term unit readiness by adjusting service end-strength ramps to reduce personnel turbulence and stress on the force, while increasing funding to improve home station training and training-related infrastructure. This past year has demonstrated that our military must be ready to fight more than just the last war.  We have to be prepared across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and in cyberspace – to engage in both low- and high-end missions and conflicts, as well as in the shadowy, so-called ‘hybrid warfare’ space in between. While this budget submission’s requested and projected funding levels will enable the military to continue making steady progress toward full-spectrum combat readiness, the gains we’ve recently made are fragile.  Sustaining them to provide for ready and capable forces will require both time and a stable flow of resources, which is why, even under the budget we’re requesting, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps won’t all reach their readiness goals until 2020, and the Air Force won’t do so until 2023. Army: For Fiscal Year 2016, the Army’s base budget of $126.5 billion supports an end-strength of 1,015,000 soldiers – 475,000 soldiers on active duty, 342,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 198,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 57 total force brigade combat teams and associated enablers.  The budget also supports 19 brigade-level training rotations at the Army’s Combat Training Centers, which are critical to the Army’s efforts to reach full-spectrum combat readiness. While the Army’s postwar end-strength target remains a force of approximately 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers and 195,000 Army Reserve soldiers, this year’s budget slows the drawdown rate.  Rather than planning to reduce the active-duty force by 20,000 soldiers and the National Guard by 14,000 soldiers in Fiscal Year 2016, the Army will instead plan to reduce by 15,000 active-duty soldiers and 8,000 Guardsmen, while still maintaining its schedule for reducing unit structure.  This will help mitigate personnel turbulence and stress, while also improving unit manning as the Army approaches its target size. The Army’s budget for Fiscal Year 2016 also includes $4.5 billion for Army helicopter modernization.  Specifically:  These investments require difficult trade-offs given today’s constrained fiscal environment.  That is why the Army is resubmitting the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative, which makes the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars by retiring outdated airframes and streamlining the Army’s helicopter fleet so that platforms can be modernized and allocated where they are needed most. As you know, I am committed to reviewing the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative.  However, the Army believes that fully implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which includes shifting National Guard Apaches to active-duty units while providing Guard units with Black Hawks, is prudent for several reasons. For one, Apaches are in high demand at high levels of readiness that would require Guard units manning them to mobilize at unprecedentedly high rates; or alternatively, for the Army to spend a total of approximately $4.4 billion to fully equip the Guard’s Apache battalions, and then $350 million per year to maintain them at those high levels of readiness.  Meanwhile, Black Hawks are more suitable for Guard missions here at home.  Whether homeland defense, disaster relief, support to civil authorities, or complementing our active-duty military, these missions tend to demand transport and medical capabilities more than the attack capabilities of Apaches.  In sum, the initiative avoids approximately $12 billion in costs through Fiscal Year 2035 and saves over $1 billion annually starting in Fiscal Year 2020.  Considering these figures, implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative is not only in the best warfighting interest of the Army, but also in the interest of the taxpayers who fund it. I know this is a contentious issue.  However, we believe the ARI is the least cost, best solution for the Army’s aviation enterprise.  DoD looks forward to making its case to the National Commission on the Future of the Army established by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Navy & Marine Corps: The Navy and Marine Corps are allocated $161 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a 282-ship fleet in 2016 and a 304-ship fleet by Fiscal Year 2020 with a return to 11 aircraft carriers, 386,600 active-duty and Reserve sailors, and 222,900 active-duty and Reserve Marines. The President’s budget invests $16.6 billion in shipbuilding for Fiscal Year 2016, and $95.9 billion over the FYDP.  The budget protects critical Navy and Marine Corps investments in undersea, surface, amphibious, and airborne capabilities – all of which are critical for addressing emerging threats.  Specifically:  Making these investments while also abiding by fiscal prudence, we had to make more difficult trade-offs.  For that reason, we are resubmitting our request to place some of the Navy’s cruisers and an amphibious landing ship – 12 ships in total, including 11 cruisers – into a phased modernization program that will provide them with enhanced capability and a longer lifespan.  Given that our cruisers are the most capable ships for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and in light of anti-ship missile capabilities being pursued by other nations, this modernization program will, over the next decade and a half, be a baseline requirement for sustaining both our cruiser fleet and 11 carrier strike groups through 2045. I acknowledge and appreciate the plan put forward in the omnibus Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, which helps us get to our goal, and which we have begun to implement.  However, this plan is more expensive, and results in shorter ship life.  Considering that our plan is critical for our power projection capabilities, we believe it should be implemented in full, and look forward to working with the Congress as we move forward. Air Force: The Air Force is allocated a base budget of $152.9 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a force of 491,700 active-duty, Guard, and Reserve airmen, 49 tactical fighter squadrons, 96 operational bombers out of a total 154-aircraft bomber fleet, and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that includes 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Air Force’s budget reflects DoD’s decision to protect modernization funding for advanced capabilities and platforms most relevant to both present and emerging threats – in this case, fifth-generation fighters, long-range bombers, and mid-air refueling aircraft to assure our air superiority and global reach; both manned and remotely-piloted aircraft to help meet Combatant Commanders’ needs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and research and development to ensure continued and competitive space launch capabilities.  Specifically:  In light of high demand coupled with Congressional consultations, the Air Force budget reflects DoD’s decision to slow the retirement timelines for three key ISR and battle management platforms. We chose to defer the retirement of the U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft until Fiscal Year 2019, when planned sensor upgrades to the RQ-4 Global Hawk will combine with other capabilities to mitigate the loss of the U-2.  We chose to delay the previously planned retirement of seven E-3 Sentry AWACS until Fiscal Year 2019, so they can support air operations over Iraq and Syria.  And we chose to delay retirement of any E-8 JSTARS through Fiscal Year 2020, pending final approval of the Air Force’s acquisition strategy for its replacement. The Air Force budget also supports a timeline that would phase out and retire the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2019.  With the gradual retirement of the A-10 that we’re proposing, the Air Force will better support legacy fleet readiness and the planned schedule for standing up the F-35A by filling in some of the overall fighter maintenance personnel shortfalls with trained and qualified personnel from the retiring A-10 squadrons. As you know, F-35 maintainer demand has already required the Air Force to use the authority Congress provided last year to move some A-10s into back-up aircraft inventory status.  I should note that the Air Force is doing so only to the extent that it absolutely must, and so far intends to move fewer A-10s into this status than what Congress has authorized.  I know this is an important issue, and DoD looks forward to working with you on it. Defense-Wide: The remaining share of our base budget – about $94 billion – is allocated across the Department of Defense.  This includes funding for cyber, U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Health Agency, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and missile defense. For Fiscal Year 2016, a $9.6 billion total investment in missile defense helps protect the U.S. homeland, deployed forces, and our allies and partners.  This includes $8.1 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, $1.6 billion of which will help ensure the reliability of U.S. ground-based interceptors, which are currently sited at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  The budget also continues to support the President’s timeline for implementing the European Phased Adaptive Approach. Overseas Contingency Operations: Separate from DoD’s base budget, we are also requesting $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Fiscal Year 2016.  This represents a 21 percent decrease from last year’s $64.2 billion in OCO funding, continuing OCO’s decline since 2010, while also reflecting continued operational demands on U.S. forces around the world.  OCO comprises funding for:  The conclusion of major combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has resulted in a 73 percent drop in DoD’s OCO costs from their $187-billion peak in Fiscal Year 2008. We are continuing to use OCO as appropriate to finance our military’s response to unforeseen crises, but we must also account for those enduring priorities that we do not envision going away – such as supporting our Afghan partners, countering terrorism, maintaining a strong forward presence in the Middle East, and ensuring our military is ready to respond to a wide range of potential crises. The Administration intends to transition OCO’s enduring costs to the base budget between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2020.  We will do this over time, and in a way that protects our defense strategy – including DoD’s abilities to deter aggression, maintain crisis-ready forces, and project power across the globe.  This transition, however, will not be possible unless the threat of sequestration has been removed. Having financed the costs of key military activities – such as counterterrorism operations and our Middle East posture – outside the base budget for 14 years, and knowing that the security situation in the Middle East remains volatile, it will take time to determine which OCO costs are most likely to be enduring, and which are not.  But we will release a plan later this year, which will also address how we will budget for uncertainty surrounding unforeseen future crises, and implications for DoD’s budget.  IV. COMPENSATION The choices we face about military compensation are vexing, critically important, and closely followed, so I want to be direct and upfront with you. When our troops go into battle – risking their lives – we owe to them, and their families, not only adequate pay and compensation, but also the right investments – in the right people, the right training, and the right weapons and equipment – so that they can accomplish their missions and come home safely. To meet all ofthese obligations at once, we have to balance how we allocate our dollars.  It would be irresponsible to prioritize compensation, force size, equipment, or training in isolation, only to put our servicemembers’ lives at unacceptable risk in battle. For the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget, the Defense Department considered its compensation proposals very carefully, as well as those approved by Congress in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.  Accordingly, this budget again proposes modest adjustments to shift funds from compensation into readiness, capability, and force structure, so that our people can continue executing their missions with continued excellence. As you know, last week President Obama informed the Congress of his Administration’s positions on the recommendations released by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.  The Department of Defense commends the commission for its 18-month independent review of the military retirement and compensation programs administered both inside and outside DoD.  Their work confirmed many positive changes that we’re making to uphold our commitments to our people, and also pointed out areas where we can do better. As I testified before Congress in March, many of the commission’s proposals would significantly affect our servicemembers and their families, and DoD owes them, President Obama, and the country our utmost diligence and most rigorous analysis.  And over the past three months, DoD has conducted a rapid yet comprehensive review of the commission’s recommendations, working closely with both the commission and our interagency partners to adopt or refine the specific proposals where possible. We are now prepared to support specific proposals for 10 of the commission’s 15 recommendations, and, given the complexities of four others, we will continue to conduct analysis and work with the commission over the next few months.  In some instances, the Defense Department is already taking steps to implement these first 10 recommendations, but in areas that will require legislative changes to do so, we will work quickly to submit proposed legislative language to Congress as soon as possible. However, while we agree with the commission that reforms to the military health care system are needed, we also believe that the TRICARE proposals in President Obama’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget serve as a good first step by offering servicemembers, military families, and retirees greater choice and control over their health care decisions.  DoD looks forward to working with the commission, our interagency partners, and interested members of Congress over the course of this year as we develop additional reform proposals to be considered for the President’s Fiscal Year 2017 budget. DoD will continue to work closely with the Congress and the commission to achieve the goals we share: ensuring the long-term strength and vitality of our all-volunteer force, and honoring all our servicemembers – past, present, and future.  V. IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION At the end of 2013, policymakers came together on a bipartisan basis to partially reverse sequestration and pay for higher discretionary funding levels with long-term reforms.  We’ve seen how that bipartisan agreement has allowed us to invest in areas ranging from research and manufacturing to strengthening our military.  We’ve also seen the positive impact on our economy, with a more responsible and orderly budget process helping contribute to the fastest job growth since the late 1990s. The President’s budget builds on this progress by reversing sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closures, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy.  The President has also made clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. As the Joint Chiefs and others have outlined, and as I will detail in this testimony, sequestration would damage our national security, ultimately resulting in a military that is too small and insufficiently equipped to fully implement our defense strategy.  This would reflect poorly on America’s global leadership, which has been the one critical but defining constant in a turbulent and dangerous world.  In fact, even the threat of sequestration has had real effects. You don’t need me to tell you that the President has said he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security.  Why?  Because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military depends on a strong educational system, thriving private-sector businesses, and innovative research.  And because that principle – matching defense increases with non-defense increases dollar-for-dollar – was a basic condition of the bipartisan agreement we got in 2013, the President sees no reason why we shouldn’t uphold those same principles in any agreement now. In recent weeks, some in Congress have tried to provide DoD with its full budget request for Fiscal Year 2016 by transferring funds from the base budget into our accounts for Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO.  While this approach clearly recognizes that the budget total we’ve requested is needed, the avenue it takes is just as clearly a road to nowhere.  I say this because President Obama has already made clear that he won’t accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward, and he won’t accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and economic security.  Legislation that implements this budget framework will therefore be subject to veto.  So if we don’t come together and find a different path by fall when a new budget is needed, it would put our department and our troops in a very difficult position.  We will yet again have to make some very hasty and drastic decisions – decisions that none of us want to be made.  The Joint Chiefs and I are concerned that if our Congressional committees continue to advance this idea and don’t explore alternatives, then we’ll all be left holding the bag. That’s not where I want to be in six months, but since the OCO funding approach is not the kind of widely-shared agreement needed, we can see now that it won’t succeed. Moreover, the one-year OCO approach does nothing to reduce the deficit.  It risks undermining support for a mechanism – OCO – meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere.  Most importantly, because it doesn’t provide a stable, multi-year budget horizon, it is managerially unsound, and also unfairly dispiriting to our force.  Our military personnel and their families deserve to know their future more than just one year at a time.  And not just them.  Our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans – not end-of-year crises or short-term fixes – to be efficient and cutting-edge.  As a nation, we need to base our defense budgeting on our long-term military strategy, and that’s not a one-year project. This funding approach also reflects a narrow way of looking at our national security – one that ignores the vital contributions made by the State, Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security Departments, and disregards the enduring long-term connection between our nation’s security and many other factors.  Factors like scientific R&D; to keep our technological edge, education of a future all-volunteer military force, and the general economic strength of our country. Finally, I’m also concerned that how we deal with the budget is being watched by the rest of the world – by our friends and potential foes alike.  It could give a misleadingly diminished picture of America’s great strength and resolve. The only way we’re going to get out of the wilderness of sequestration is if we work together.  I therefore appeal to members of Congress, from both parties, to start looking for ways to find a truly bipartisan compromise.  I hope they can make clear to their colleagues that sequestration would also damage America’s long-term strength, preventing our country from making pro-growth investments in areas ranging from basic research to early childhood education – investments that, in the past, have helped make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Sequestration is set to return in just under 150 days.  Letting that happen would be unwise and unsafe for our national defense, over both the short and long term. Short-Term Impact DoD has had to live with uncertain budgets for the last three years, continuous and sudden downward revisions of our budget plans, and even a government closure.  To continue meeting all of our mission requirements, we’ve done our best to manage through these circumstances, underfunding significant parts of our force and its support systems.  Put bluntly, we have survived, but not thrived.  Our military has made painful choices and tradeoffs among the size, capabilities, and readiness of our joint force, and we’ve amassed a number of bills that are now coming due. That’s why the department has been counting on and planning for a budget increase of roughly $35 billion above sequestration-level caps in Fiscal Year 2016.  If it looks like DoD will be operating at sequestration levels in 2016, on October 1 we will have to swiftly begin making cuts so that we don’t end up $35 billion short as we approach year’s end. A return to sequestration in Fiscal Year 2016 would affect all aspects of the department, but not all equally. More than one-third of the Fiscal Year 2016 cuts would come have to come from Operations and Maintenance accounts, with unavoidable reductions in readiness and our ability to shape world events in America’s interest.  Let me put this more plainly:  allowing sequestration to return would deprive our troops of what they need to accomplish their missions. Approximately half of the cuts would have to come from the department’s modernization accounts, undermining our efforts to secure technological superiority for U.S. forces in future conflicts.  Because there are bills that DoD absolutely must pay – such as the salaries of our troops – many capabilities being developed to counter known threats from highly capable adversaries would be delayed or cancelled, deepening our nation’s vulnerabilities at a time when the world is growing more dangerous, not less.  Sequestration would put a hold on critical programs like our Aerospace Innovation Initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Engine, the Ground-Based Interceptor missile defense kill vehicle redesign, and several space control efforts. Deferring these investments is bad policy and makes the Defense Department less competitive for the future.  What’s more, it breaks faith with the troops of today and the troops of tomorrow.  And it undermines the defense industrial base that is a critical foundation for our national security. Long-Term Impact If sequestration were to persist over time, the long-term consequences would be harder hitting.  We would ultimately have a military that looks fundamentally different, and that performs much differently, from what our nation is accustomed to. If we are forced to sequestration-level budgets, I do not believe that we can continue to make incremental cuts and maintain the same general set of objectives as we’ve had in our defense strategy.  I will insist that new cuts be accompanied by a frank reassessment of our strategic approach to addressing the threats we face around the world – what we are asking the Armed Forces to do and to be prepared to do. I cannot tell you right now exactly what that means – DoD is not resigned to the return of sequestration – but I can tell you that I will direct the department to look at all aspects of the defense budget to determine how best to absorb these cuts.  No portion of our budget can remain inviolate. What I will not do is let DoD continue mortgaging our future readiness and capability.  I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, and ineffective doctrine. Everything else is on the table. What does that mean?  We could be forced to consider pay cuts, not just cuts in the growth of compensation.  We could be forced to consider all means of shedding excess infrastructure, not just working within the Congressional BRAC process.  We could be forced to look at significant force structure cuts, not just trimming around the edges.  We could be forced to ask our military to do – and be prepared to do – significantly less than what we have traditionally expected, and required of it. I am not afraid to ask these difficult questions, but if we are stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. A prolonged period of depressed defense budgets will almost certainly mean a smaller, less capable, and less ready military.  No one can fully predict the impact on the future.  But it could translate into future conflicts that last longer, and are more costly in both lives and dollars. That may sound severe to some, but it is a fact, and history should be our guide when we think about the true cost of sequestration. The Case for Repealing Sequestration I know I’m preaching to the choir here.  If sequestration could have been reversed by just this committee and its counterpart in the House, it probably would have happened years ago.  So I offer the following to Members of the Committee about what you can remind your colleagues when you ask for their vote to repeal sequestration: Remind them that even after the increase we’re asking for, DoD’s budget as a share of total federal spending will still be at a near-historic low – a quarter of what it was during the Korean War, a third of what it was during the Vietnam War, and half of what it was during the Reagan buildup. Remind them that the increased funding is for modernization that’s critical to keeping our military’s technological edge and staying ahead of potential adversaries. Remind them that DoD has hands-on leadership from the very top – me – devoted to using taxpayer dollars better than they’ve been used in the past.  You have my personal commitment to greater accountability, greater efficiency, and running this department better and leaner than before. Remind them that sequestration’s cuts to long-term investments will likely make those investments more costly down the line.  All who bemoan unnecessary Pentagon program delays and the associated cost overruns should know that sequestration will only make these problems worse.  I can easily sympathize with my non-defense counterparts in this regard; knowing how wasteful and inefficient sequestration would be at DoD, I have no doubt the same is true at other departments and agencies as well. Remind them that sequestration’s impact on our domestic budget will cause further long-term damage to our defense – because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military needs strong schools to provide the best people, strong businesses to provide the best weapons and equipment, and strong science and research sectors to provide the best new innovations and technologies. Remind them that we can’t keep kicking this can down the road.  The more we prolong tough decisions, the more difficult and more costly they will be later on.  VI. CONCLUSION The men and women of the Department of Defense are counting on Congress to help assure the strength of our military and American global leadership at a time of great change in the world. We must reverse the decline in defense budgets to execute our strategy and fund a modern, ready, leaner force in a balanced way.  We must seize the opportunity to enact necessary reforms in how we do business.  And we must bring an end to the threat sequestration poses to the future of our force and American credibility around the world. As you evaluate the President’s budget submission, I encourage you and your colleagues to keep it in perspective. In the years since the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 budget request – the benchmark for cuts prescribed under the 2011 Budget Control Act – DoD’s 10-year budget projections have absorbed more than $750 billion in cuts, or more than three-quarters of the trillion-dollar cuts that would be required should sequestration be allowed to run its course.  And while some claim this is our biggest budget ever, the fact is, as a share of total federal spending, DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget is at a near-historic low – representing about 14 percent of total federal discretionary and non-discretionary outlays.  DoD’s total budget remains more than $100 billion below what it was at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was even more complicated than we could have foreseen.  Given today’s security environment – which has over 200,000 American servicemembers stationed in over 130 countries conducting nearly 60 named operations – our proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is a responsible, prudent approach. Some of you may recall how, in 1991, after America’s Cold War victory and amid doubts about America’s engagement with the world and calls for a bigger domestic peace dividend, a bipartisan group in Congress stepped forward to help shape America’ global leadership and make long-term decisions from which we continue to benefit. Senators Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar helped craft, pass, and pay for the small Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that allowed the United States and DoD to provide the funding and expertise to help former Soviet states decommission their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles. The Nunn-Lugar program was initially opposed abroad, and there were also doubts at the Pentagon about whether we could implement it without losing track of funding.  I know.  I helped lead the program in its early years.  But with slow and diligent effort by American defense officials, the Congress, and our foreign partners, it worked. It helped prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands.  It helped establish a pattern of international cooperation and global norms in the post-Cold War international order.  And, in the light of the current instability in Ukraine, it might have staved off several variants of nuclear disaster. But it also set an important precedent for our work on this budget and in the years ahead.  It shows what Congressional conviction – especially when it is bipartisan – can accomplish in foreign policy.  It shows the value of foresight and planning for an uncertain future.  And it shows how spending a relatively few dollars today can generate huge value down the line. As the new Secretary of Defense, I hope it will be possible to again unite behind what our great nation should do to protect our people and make a better world, and provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they deserve. Thank you.

"March 3, 2015","Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee:  thank you for confirming me as Secretary of Defense, and for inviting me here today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget request for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Oversight is key to our system of government.  I not only welcome your wisdom and experience; I also want your partnership, and need your help. I also want to thank Chairman Dempsey for his leadership, as well as Deputy Secretary Work and Vice Chairman Winnefeld, in particular for all their hard work over the past year in helping develop the budget request we will be discussing today.  I. INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY Since I last appeared before this committee, I had the opportunity to see our troops in Afghanistan and Kuwait.  Hearing from them was one of my highest priorities upon taking office. In Afghanistan, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are helping cement progress made toward a more secure, stable, and prosperous future, by training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and continuing their counter-terrorism mission.  They are working to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our homeland, or on our partners and allies. In Kuwait, our men and women in uniform are contributing to our counter-ISIL coalition in Iraq and Syria.  They are working closely with Iraq and our global coalition partners to ensure that local forces can deliver lasting defeat to a vile enemy that has barbarically murdered American citizens, Iraqis, Syrians, and so many others, and that seeks to export its hateful and twisted ideology across the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. No doubt the challenges and opportunities we face extend well beyond the Middle East. In Europe, our troops are helping reinforce and reassure our allies in Eastern Europe as we confront a reversion to archaic security thinking. In the Asia-Pacific – home to half the world’s population and economy – they are working to modernize our alliances, build new partnerships, and helping the United States continue to underwrite stability, peace, and prosperity in the region – as we have for decades. And as we still meet longtime challenges, such as the continuing imperative to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction, our armed forces are also addressing new dangers, such as in cyberspace. Across the world, it is America’s leadership, and America’s men and women in uniform, who often stand between disorder and order – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing behind those who believe in a more secure, just, and prosperous future. Mr. Chairman, this committee and this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so – whether they can continue to defend our nation’s interests around the world with the readiness, capability, and excellence our nation has grown accustomed to, and sometimes taken for granted. Halting and reversing the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. It would ensure we field a modern, ready force in a balanced way, while also embracing change and reform, because asking for more taxpayer dollars requires we hold up our end of the bargain – by ensuring that every dollar is well-spent. The President is proposing to increase the defense budget in Fiscal Year 2016, but in line with the projection he submitted to Congress last year in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget’s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The department is executing the plan it presented last year.  Accordingly, for Fiscal Year 2016, the President is proposing $534 billion for DoD’s base budget and $51 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), totaling $585 billion to sustain America’s national security and defense strategies. The Defense Department needs your support for this budget, which is driven by strategy, not the other way around.  More specifically, it is driven by the defense strategy identified in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which reflects the longtime, bipartisan consensus that our military must protect the homeland, build security globally, and project power and win decisively.  We do so in line with our longstanding tradition of maintaining a superior force with an unmatched technological edge, working in close partnership with friends and allies, upholding the rules-based international order, and keeping our commitments to the people who make up the all-volunteer force. Our defense budget’s priorities line up with our strategic priorities:  sustaining America’s global leadership by:  This budget ensures we can execute our defense strategy with manageable risk, even as it does require us to accept elevated risk in some areas. But – and I want to be clear about this – parts of our nation’s defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration, which remains the law of the land and is set to return 212 days from today. As I have said before, the prospect of sequestration’s serious damage to our national security and economy is tragically not a result of an economic emergency or recession. It is not because these budget cuts are a mathematical solution to the nation’s overall fiscal challenge – they are not. It is not because paths of curbing nondiscretionary spending and reforming our tax system have been explored and exhausted – they have not. It is not due to a breakthrough in military technology or a new strategic insight that somehow makes continued defense spending unnecessary – there has been no such silver bullet. And it is not because the world has suddenly become more peaceful – for it is abundantly clear that it has not. Instead, sequestration is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.  And friends and potential enemies around the world are watching. We in the Department of Defense are prepared to make difficult strategic and budgetary choices.  We are also committed – more than ever before – to finding new ways to improve the way we do business and be more efficient and accountable in our defense spending. But in order to ensure our military remains the world’s finest fighting force, we need to banish the clouds of fiscal uncertainty that have obscured our plans and forced inefficient choices.  We need a long-term restoration of normal budgeting and a deal that the President can sign, and that lives up to our responsibility of defending this country and the global order.  And that means, among other things, avoiding sequestration. To be sure, even under sequestration, America will remain the world’s strongest military power.  But under sequestration, our military – and our national security – would have to take on irresponsible and unnecessary risk – risk that previous Administrations and Congressional leaders have wisely chosen to avoid. Sequestration would lead over time to a military that looks fundamentally different and performs much differently than what we are used to.  Not only as Secretary of Defense, but simply as an American, I deeply, earnestly hope we can avert that future.  I am committed to working with the members of this committee, and your colleagues throughout the Congress to prevent it. I know how proud you and all Americans are that we field the finest fighting force in the world.  But our military superiority was not built, and will not be sustained, by resting on our laurels.  So instead of resigning ourselves to having the diminished military that sequestration would give us, I propose that we build the force of the future, together.  II. BUILDING THE FORCE OF THE FUTURE Assuming the Congress funds the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget and averts sequestration, we have the opportunity to build the force of the future.  We have inherited a long tradition of military excellence from those who came before us, and we must preserve it for those who will come after. But to do so, DoD must embrace the future – and embrace change – throughout our institution.  We must be open to new ideas and new ways of doing business that can help us operate more efficiently and perform more effectively in an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment. As DoD counters the very real dangers we face in the world, we will also grab hold of the bright opportunities before us – opportunities to be more competitive and re-forge our nation’s military and defense establishment into a future force that harnesses and develops the latest, cutting-edge technology, and that remains superior to any potential adversary; one that is efficient and accountable to the taxpayers who support it; and one that competes and succeeds in attracting the next generation of talented Americans to fill its ranks. These are the three main pillars on which DoD will build the force of the future. Competitiveness through Technological and Operational Superiority As other nations pursue comprehensive military modernization programs and develop technologies designed to blunt our military’s traditional advantages, the first pillar of our future force must be ensuring that we maintain – and extend – our technological edge over any potential adversary. The President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget includes targeted investments in modernized space, cyber, and missile defense capabilities geared toward countering emerging threats that could upend our technological superiority and our ability to project power.  DoD would look forward to providing a full account of our proposed modernization investments, and the threats that compel them, in a classified setting. The budget also supports the Defense Innovation Initiative, which will help ensure the military continues to ride the leading edge of innovation, and makes deferred modernization investments that will ensure America’s nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective.  Across all these efforts, we must be open to global, commercial technology as well, and learn from advances in the private sector. Because we know that technology alone – however advanced – cannot sustain our military’s superiority, just as important is a ruthless focus on operational excellence.  This means using our existing forces and capabilities in new, creative, and fiscally prudent ways to achieve our objectives.  This also means working to develop more innovative and effective strategic and military options for the President, introducing a new and more rapidly responsive global force management model, developing new operational concepts, and reforming and updating all our operational plans. Competitiveness through Accountability & Efficiency The second pillar of building the force of the future requires redoubling our efforts to make DoD more accountable and efficient.  We live in a competitive world and need to be a competitive organization.  If we don’t lean ourselves out and maintain our fighting weight, we have no business asking our fellow citizens for more resources. As I made clear in my confirmation hearing, I cannot suggest greater support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is always spent as well as it should be. American taxpayers rightly have trouble comprehending – let alone supporting – the defense budget when they read of cost overruns, lack of accounting and accountability, needless overhead, and the like. If we’re asking taxpayers to not only give us half a trillion of their hard-earned dollars, but also give us more than we got last year, we have to demonstrate that we can be responsible with it. We must do all we can to spend their money more wisely and more responsibly.  We must reduce overhead, and we must curb wasteful spending practices wherever they are. DoD has sought to continuously improve our acquisition processes over the past five years, and I am proud myself to have been a part of that effort.  Today, I am recommitting the Defense Department to working both with Congress, and on our own, to find new and more creative ways of stretching our defense dollars to give our troops the weapons and equipment they need. The department’s Better Buying Power initiative is now on its third iteration since I established it in 2010, with Better Buying Power 3.0 focused on achieving dominant capabilities through technical excellence.  I know well and very much appreciate the strong support for acquisition reform demonstrated by the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, and their Chairmen, and I share their deep desire to achieve real, lasting results that benefit both America’s security and taxpayers. DoD is working closely with committee Members and staff on ways to eliminate some of the burdensome and duplicative administrative requirements levied on our program managers.  To that end, the President’s FY 2016 budget submission includes a number of legislative proposals designed to help streamline the program oversight process.  We look forward to continuing our close partnership with Congress to see these measures implemented. As we sustain our focus on acquisition reform, I believe that DoD must concurrently undertake a wholesale review of our business practices and management systems. Our goal is to identify where we can further reduce the cost of doing business to free up funding for readiness and modernization – ensuring that our energy, focus, and resources are devoted to supporting our frontline operations as much as possible. We intend to work closely with industry partners – who execute or enable many of our programs, logistics, training, administrative, and other functions – throughout this process, both to explore how they could help us accomplish our missions at reduced cost, and because they may have new and innovative ideas worth considering. Additionally, the Defense Department is pursuing creative force structure changes to be more agile and efficient – such as how we’re modernizing our cruisers and restructuring Army aviation.  We’ve established a new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.  And four previous rounds of efficiency and budget reduction initiatives have yielded approximately $78 billion in projected and actual savings in FY 2016, helping to cushion our defense programs from successive years of budget cuts. We’re also working hard to cut unnecessary overhead: from reducing management headquarters budgets by 20 percent across the department, to divesting excess bases and infrastructure. When DoD recently requested a round of domestic Base Realignment and Closure, Congress asked that we first pursue efficiencies in Europe.  We did.  DoD has approved and is pursuing a broad European Infrastructure Consolidation – which will result in some $500 million in annual recurring savings.  We now need a round of domestic BRAC beginning in Fiscal Year 2017 to address excess infrastructure here at home. Simply put, we have more bases in more places than we need.  We estimate DoD has about 25 percent more infrastructure capacity than necessary.  We must be permitted to divest surplus infrastructure as we reduce and renew force structure.  With projected recurring savings from a new BRAC round totaling some $2 billion a year, it would be irresponsible to cut tooth without also cutting tail. For base communities in question, it’s important to remember that BRAC is often an opportunity to be seized.  Communities have shown that BRAC is ultimately what you make of it, and there are plenty of places that have emerged from it stronger than they were before. Consider Lawrence, Indiana, which took advantage of Fort Harrison’s closure in 1996 to create an enterprise zone, community college, recreational facilities, and commercial sites that in just 7 years not only replaced 100 percent of the jobs lost when the base closed, but created even more. Charleston, South Carolina stepped up when the Charleston Naval Complex closed in 1993, and now is home to more than 80 new industrial and federal agency tenants.  The former naval base is now producing millions of dollars’ worth of goods that are exported to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. And at former Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, the local redevelopment effort has invested $400 million and created more than 6,500 jobs – over six times the number of jobs lost when the base closed in 1993.  It’s now home to scores of businesses, a mixture of private companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. These are just a few examples of what can happen when local leaders, communities, and businesses work together and take advantage of the opportunities for new jobs and new growth after BRAC. One more point on accountability:  Whether we’re improving acquisition or closing bases, it is not enough to simply tell taxpayers that we’re spending their dollars responsibly.  We have to also show them, which is why good cost accounting and financial auditability is so important to me. DoD has made significant progress over the past five years in adding more discipline to our business environment, but there is much work left to be done, and we remain fully committed to our current audit goals. Today, over 90 percent of DoD’s current year, general fund budgetary resources are under some form of financial audit, with the military services all involved and following the model employed by the Marine Corps. We plan to submit every corner of DoD to this kind of audit regimen beginning in FY 2016.  With this foundation, the department will progressively expand the scope of these audits until all our organizations, funds, and financial statements will be under audit in FY 2018, complying with Congress’s statutory direction to be audit ready by the end of FY 2017. There’s a reason why auditing is a basic practice as ancient as the Domesday Book, and it is time that DoD finally lives up to its moral and legal obligation to be accountable to those who pay its bills.  I intend to do everything we can – including holding people to account – to get this done. Competitiveness through Attracting Future Talent Third, but no less important, DoD must be competitive when it comes to attracting new generations of talented and dedicated Americans to our calling of defending the nation. We know how the attacks of September 11th, 2001 motivated so many Americans to want to be part of this noble endeavor.  Going forward, we must ensure our future force can continue to recruit the finest young men and women our country has to offer – military and civilian – like those who serve today. As we do this, we must be mindful that the next generation expects jobs that give them purpose, meaning, and dignity.  They want to be able to make real contributions, have their voices heard, and gain valuable and transferable experience.  We must shape the kind of force they want to be in.  The battle for talent will demand enlightened and agile leaders, new training schemes, new educational opportunities, and new compensation approaches. DoD is already pursuing several initiatives that will help ensure the military is a compelling career option.  In recent years, we’ve been expanding pilot programs that facilitate breaks in service that let our people gain diverse work experience.  We’ve tailored our transition assistance program, Transition GPS, to better prepare servicemembers to enter the civilian workforce – providing different tracks for those who want to go to college, those who want skills training, and those who want to be entrepreneurs.  And we’ve put a renewed focus on military ethics and professionalism, as well as making sure our military health system is held to the same high-quality standards we expect from the servicemembers and military family members under its care. Because we know how important it is – both for today’s servicemembers and the generation that will follow them – we’re also deeply committed to creating an environment and culture where we live the values we defend and every servicemember is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. That’s why we’re continuing to expand combat positions available to women – because everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country should have full and equal opportunity to do so. It’s why we’re striving to eliminate sexual assault from the military. And it’s why we’ve been making sure gay and lesbian servicemembers can serve openly, and that their families receive the benefits their loved ones have earned. But for everything we’re doing, DoD cannot build the force of the future by ourselves.  We need Congress’s help. What We Need Congress To Do Since our current defense budget drawdown began several years ago, I’ve observed something of a phenomenon here in Washington. Along with our troops, their families, and our defense civilians, I thank our supporters on Capitol Hill, including most members of this committee, who have joined with us in trying to do everything possible to get Congress to prevent more mindless cuts to our defense budget. Unfortunately, these combined efforts have been unsuccessful in actually restoring adequate and predictable resources for DoD.  We have had to endure deep cuts to readiness, weather pay freezes and civilian furloughs, and cut badly needed investments in modernization and critical technologies.  At the same time, Congress has sometimes sought to protect programs that DoD has argued are no longer needed, or require significant reform. We have had the worst of both worlds – a double whammy of mindless sequestration coupled with inability to reform. As many of you know, it wasn’t always this way. During the defense drawdown after the Cold War, DoD had much more flexibility thanks to the help of Congress.  For example, we were able to resize the Army, retire the A-6 Intruder and many other weapons systems, and implement multiple BRAC rounds, which freed up dollars we re-allocated to keep our force structure ready, capable, and deployable around the world. I know some of the changes and reforms we’re proposing may feel like a significant change from how we currently do business.  But if anyone can understand how the dots connect and how we need Congress’s help to be able to defend our country, our allies, and our interests in an increasingly dangerous world, it’s you – the members of this committee. The fact is, if we’re not able to implement the changes and reforms we need, we will be forced to make painful tradeoffs, even at the higher topline the President is requesting.  We will lose further ground on modernization and readiness – leaving tomorrow’s force less capable and leaving our nation less secure.  And we will face significant hurdles to executing our nation’s defense strategy.  That’s why we need your help.  III. THE PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET As we do every year when formulating our budget, this budget seeks to balance readiness, capability, and size – because we must ensure that, whatever the size of our force, we have the resources to provide every servicemember with the right training, the right equipment, the right compensation, and the right quality of fellow troops.  That is the only way we can ensure our military is fully prepared to accomplish its missions. Almost two-thirds of DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 base budget – $348.4 billion – funds our day-to-day expenses, similar to what a business would call its operating budget.  This covers, among other expenses, the cost of fuel, spare parts, logistics support, maintenance, service contracts, and administration.  It also includes pay and benefits for military and civilian personnel, which by themselves comprise nearly half of our total budget. The remaining third of our base budget – $185.9 billion – comprises investments in future defense needs, much like a business’ capital improvement budget.  It pays for the research, development, testing, evaluation, and ultimately acquisition of the weapons, equipment, and facilities that our servicemembers need. Broken down differently, our base budget includes the following categories:  Modernization What makes this budget different is the focus it puts, more so than any other over the last decade, on new funding for modernization.  After years of war, which required the deferral of longer-term modernization investments, this budget puts renewed emphasis on preparing for future threats – especially threats that challenge our military’s power projection capabilities. Threats to Power Projection and our Technological Edge Being able to project power anywhere across the globe by rapidly surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies lies at the core of our defense strategy and what the American people have come to expect of their military.  It guarantees that when an acute crisis erupts anywhere in the world, America can provide aid when disaster strikes, reinforce our allies when they are threatened, and protect our citizens and interests globally.  It also assures freedom of navigation and overflight, and allows global commerce to flow freely. For decades, U.S. global power projection has relied on the ships, planes, submarines, bases, aircraft carriers, satellites, networks, and other advanced capabilities that comprise our military’s unrivaled technological edge.  But today that superiority is being challenged in unprecedented ways. Advanced military technologies, from rockets and drones to chemical and biological capabilities, have found their way into the arsenals of both non-state actors as well as previously less capable militaries.  And other nations – among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea – have been pursuing long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap that has long existed between them and the United States. These modernization programs are developing and fielding advanced aircraft, submarines, and both longer-range and more accurate ballistic and cruise missiles.  They’re developing new and advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles, as well as new counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities.  In some areas, we see levels of new weapons development that we haven’t seen since the mid-1980s, near the peak of the Soviet Union’s surge in Cold War defense spending. Targeted Investments in the President’s Budget One of the reasons we are asking for more money this year than last year is to reverse recent under-investment in new weapons systems by making targeted investments to help us stay ahead of emerging threats – adding substantial funding for space control and launch capabilities, missile defense, cyber, and advanced sensors, communications, and munitions – all of which are critical for power projection in contested environments. The budget also makes significant investments in the resilience and survivability of our infrastructure and forces, particularly in the western Pacific, with improved active defenses such as our Patriot and AEGIS systems, as well as selective hardening of key installations and facilities. DoD is also addressing the erosion of U.S. technological superiority with the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII).  The DII is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century. The DII will identify, develop, and field breakthrough technologies and systems through a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program, and the President’s budget supports this effort through specific investments in promising new technologies and capabilities such as high-speed strike weapons, advanced aeronautics, rail guns, and high energy lasers.  The DII also involves the development of innovative operational concepts that would help us use our current capabilities in new and creative ways.  The ultimate aim is to help craft ‘offset strategies’ that maximize our strengths and exploit the weaknesses of potential adversaries. Our budget is also making focused and sustained investments in modernization and manning across the nuclear enterprise, even as we reduce the roles and numbers of nuclear weapons in the U.S. nuclear posture.  These investments are critical for ensuring the continued safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, as well as the long-term health of the force that supports our nuclear triad, particularly after recent troubling lapses in parts of DoD’s nuclear enterprise.  To help fund improvements across the nuclear enterprise, we are requesting an increase of approximately $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016, and about $8 billion over the FYDP. Readiness DoD must rebuild and recover after more than 13 years of uninterrupted war.  But our effort to do so has been frustrated by two variables, both of which are out of our hands – one, the continued high operational tempo and high demand for our forces, and two, the uncertainty surrounding annual appropriations. Only over the last couple of years has readiness begun to recover from the strains of over a decade of war, exacerbated by sequestration in 2013.  Nevertheless, readiness remains at troubling levels across the force. While our forward-deployed forces remain ready, our surge forces at home are not as ready as they need to be.  The President’s budget therefore invests in near-term unit readiness by adjusting service end-strength ramps to reduce personnel turbulence and stress on the force, while increasing funding to improve home station training and training-related infrastructure. This past year has demonstrated that our military must be ready to fight more than just the last war.  We have to be prepared across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and in cyberspace – to engage in both low- and high-end missions and conflicts, as well as in the shadowy, so-called ‘hybrid warfare’ space in between. While this budget submission’s requested and projected funding levels will enable the military to continue making steady progress toward full-spectrum combat readiness, the gains we’ve recently made are fragile.  Sustaining them to provide for ready and capable forces will require both time and a stable flow of resources, which is why, even under the budget we’re requesting, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps won’t all reach their readiness goals until 2020, and the Air Force won’t do so until 2023. Army: For Fiscal Year 2016, the Army’s base budget of $126.5 billion supports an end-strength of 1,015,000 soldiers – 475,000 soldiers on active duty, 342,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 198,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 57 total force brigade combat teams and associated enablers.  The budget also supports 19 brigade-level training rotations at the Army’s Combat Training Centers, which are critical to the Army’s efforts to reach full-spectrum combat readiness. While the Army’s postwar end-strength target remains a force of approximately 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers and 195,000 Army Reserve soldiers, this year’s budget slows the drawdown rate.  Rather than planning to reduce the active-duty force by 20,000 soldiers and the National Guard by 14,000 soldiers in Fiscal Year 2016, the Army will instead plan to reduce by 15,000 active-duty soldiers and 8,000 Guardsmen, while still maintaining its schedule for reducing unit structure.  This will help mitigate personnel turbulence and stress, while also improving unit manning as the Army approaches its target size. The Army’s budget for Fiscal Year 2016 also includes $4.5 billion for Army helicopter modernization.  Specifically:  These investments require difficult trade-offs given today’s constrained fiscal environment.  That is why the Army is resubmitting the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative, which makes the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars by retiring outdated airframes and streamlining the Army’s helicopter fleet so that platforms can be modernized and allocated where they are needed most. As you know, I am committed to reviewing the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative.  However, the Army believes that fully implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which includes shifting National Guard Apaches to active-duty units while providing Guard units with Black Hawks, is prudent for several reasons. For one, Apaches are in high demand at high levels of readiness that would require Guard units manning them to mobilize at unprecedentedly high rates; or alternatively, for the Army to spend a total of approximately $4.4 billion to fully equip the Guard’s Apache battalions, and then $350 million per year to maintain them at those high levels of readiness.  Meanwhile, Black Hawks are more suitable for Guard missions here at home.  Whether homeland defense, disaster relief, support to civil authorities, or complementing our active-duty military, these missions tend to demand transport and medical capabilities more than the attack capabilities of Apaches.  In sum, the initiative avoids approximately $12 billion in costs through Fiscal Year 2035 and saves over $1 billion annually starting in Fiscal Year 2020.  Considering these figures, implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative is not only in the best warfighting interest of the Army, but also in the interest of the taxpayers who fund it. I know this is a contentious issue.  However, we believe the ARI is the least cost, best solution for the Army’s aviation enterprise.  DoD looks forward to making its case to the National Commission on the Future of the Army established by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Navy & Marine Corps: The Navy and Marine Corps are allocated $161 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a 282-ship fleet in 2016 and a 304-ship fleet by Fiscal Year 2020 with a return to 11 aircraft carriers, 386,600 active-duty and Reserve sailors, and 222,900 active-duty and Reserve Marines. The President’s budget invests $16.6 billion in shipbuilding for Fiscal Year 2016, and $95.9 billion over the FYDP.  The budget protects critical Navy and Marine Corps investments in undersea, surface, amphibious, and airborne capabilities – all of which are critical for addressing emerging threats.  Specifically:  Making these investments while also abiding by fiscal prudence, we had to make more difficult trade-offs.  For that reason, we are resubmitting our request to place some of the Navy’s cruisers and an amphibious landing ship – 12 ships in total, including 11 cruisers – into a phased modernization program that will provide them with enhanced capability and a longer lifespan.  Given that our cruisers are the most capable ships for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and in light of anti-ship missile capabilities being pursued by other nations, this modernization program will, over the next decade and a half, be a baseline requirement for sustaining both our cruiser fleet and 11 carrier strike groups through 2045. I acknowledge and appreciate the plan put forward in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which helps us get to our goal, and which we have begun to implement.  However, this plan is more expensive, and results in shorter ship life.  Considering that our plan is critical for our power projection capabilities, we believe it should be implemented in full, and look forward to working with the Congress as we move forward. Air Force: The Air Force is allocated a base budget of $152.9 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a force of 491,700 active-duty, Guard, and Reserve airmen, 49 tactical fighter squadrons, 96 operational bombers out of a total 154-aircraft bomber fleet, and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that includes 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Air Force’s budget reflects DoD’s decision to protect modernization funding for advanced capabilities and platforms most relevant to both present and emerging threats – in this case, fifth-generation fighters, long-range bombers, and mid-air refueling aircraft to assure our air superiority and global reach; both manned and remotely-piloted aircraft to help meet Combatant Commanders’ needs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and research and development to ensure continued and competitive space launch capabilities.  Specifically:  In light of high demand coupled with Congressional consultations, the Air Force budget reflects DoD’s decision to slow the retirement timelines for three key ISR and battle management platforms. We chose to defer the retirement of the U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft until Fiscal Year 2019, when planned sensor upgrades to the RQ-4 Global Hawk will combine with other capabilities to mitigate the loss of the U-2.  We chose to delay the previously planned retirement of seven E-3 Sentry AWACS until Fiscal Year 2019, so they can support air operations over Iraq and Syria.  And we chose to delay retirement of any E-8 JSTARS through Fiscal Year 2020, pending final approval of the Air Force’s acquisition strategy for its replacement. The Air Force budget also supports a timeline that would phase out and retire the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2019.  With the gradual retirement of the A-10 that we’re proposing, the Air Force will better support legacy fleet readiness and the planned schedule for standing up the F-35A by filling in some of the overall fighter maintenance personnel shortfalls with trained and qualified personnel from the retiring A-10 squadrons. As you know, F-35 maintainer demand has already required the Air Force to use the authority Congress provided last year to move some A-10s into back-up aircraft inventory status.  I should note that the Air Force is doing so only to the extent that it absolutely must, and so far intends to move far fewer A-10s into this status than what Congress has authorized.  I know this is an important issue, and DoD looks forward to working with you on it. Defense-Wide: The remaining share of our base budget – about $94 billion – is allocated across the Department of Defense.  This includes funding for cyber, U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Health Agency, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and missile defense. For Fiscal Year 2016, a $9.6 billion total investment in missile defense helps protect the U.S. homeland, deployed forces, and our allies and partners.  This includes $8.1 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, $1.6 billion of which will help ensure the reliability of U.S. ground-based interceptors, which are currently sited at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  The budget also continues to support the President’s timeline for implementing the European Phased Adaptive Approach. Overseas Contingency Operations: Separate from DoD’s base budget, we are also requesting $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Fiscal Year 2016.  This represents a 21 percent decrease from last year’s $64.2 billion in OCO funding, continuing OCO’s decline since 2010, while also reflecting continued operational demands on U.S. forces around the world.  OCO comprises funding for:  The conclusion of major combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has resulted in a 73 percent drop in DoD’s OCO costs from their $187-billion peak in Fiscal Year 2008. We are continuing to use OCO as appropriate to finance our military’s response to unforeseen crises, but we must also account for those enduring priorities that we do not envision going away – such as supporting our Afghan partners, countering terrorism, maintaining a strong forward presence in the Middle East, and ensuring our military is ready to respond to a wide range of potential crises. The Administration intends to transition OCO’s enduring costs to the base budget between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2020.  We will do this over time, and in a way that protects our defense strategy – including DoD’s abilities to deter aggression, maintain crisis-ready forces, and project power across the globe.  This transition, however, will not be possible unless the threat of sequestration has been removed. Having financed the costs of key military activities – such as counterterrorism operations and our Middle East posture – outside the base budget for 14 years, and knowing that the security situation in the Middle East remains volatile, it will take time to determine which OCO costs are most likely to be enduring, and which are not.  But we will release a plan later this year, which will also address how we will budget for uncertainty surrounding unforeseen future crises, and implications for DoD’s budget.  IV. COMPENSATION The choices we face about military compensation are vexing, critically important, and closely followed, so I want to be direct and upfront with you. When our troops go into battle – risking their lives – we owe to them, and their families, not only adequate pay and compensation, but also the right investments – in the right people, the right training, and the right weapons and equipment – so that they can accomplish their missions and come home safely. To meet all ofthese obligations at once, we have to balance how we allocate our dollars.  It would be irresponsible to prioritize compensation, force size, equipment, or training in isolation, only to put our servicemembers’ lives at unacceptable risk in battle. For the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget, the Defense Department considered its compensation proposals very carefully, as well as those approved by Congress in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.  Accordingly, this budget again proposes modest adjustments to shift funds from compensation into readiness, capability, and force structure, so that our people can continue executing their missions with continued excellence. As you know, the Congressionally-commissioned Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission has recently released its own compensation proposals.  Their work, which DoD is continuing to analyze, shows thoughtfulness and good intent, which we deeply appreciate. Given that this hearing is being held before the department has submitted its recommendations on the commission’s report to President Obama, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss them at this time.  Many of these proposals would significantly affect our servicemembers and their families, and DoD owes them, the President, and the country our utmost diligence and most rigorous analysis. However, I can say that the department agrees with the overarching goals of the commission, especially providing servicemembers and beneficiaries more options – whether in preparing for retirement or in making health care choices. I can also say that the commission’s proposals are complicated, and do not lend themselves to binary answers.  Therefore, when we provide the President with our recommendations on each proposal, DoD will clarify not simply whether we support each proposal, but also where we recommend specific modifications to improve or enable us to fully support a given proposal. We believe there is something positive in almost every one of the commission’s recommendations, and that they present a great opportunity to ensure we honor our servicemembers past, present, and future.  I look forward to Congress’s support and partnership as we work hard to take advantage of it.  V. IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION At the end of 2013, policymakers came together on a bipartisan basis to partially reverse sequestration and pay for higher discretionary funding levels with long-term reforms.  We’ve seen how that bipartisan agreement has allowed us to invest in areas ranging from research and manufacturing to strengthening our military.  We’ve also seen the positive impact on our economy, with a more responsible and orderly budget process helping contribute to the fastest job growth since the late 1990s. The President’s budget builds on this progress by reversing sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closures, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy.  The President has also made clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. As the Joint Chiefs and others have outlined, and as I will detail in this testimony, sequestration would damage our national security, ultimately resulting in a military that is too small and insufficiently equipped to fully implement our defense strategy.  This would reflect poorly on America’s global leadership, which has been the one critical but defining constant in a turbulent and dangerous world.  In fact, even the threat of sequestration has had real effects. You don’t need me to tell you that the President has said he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security.  Why?  Because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military depends on a strong educational system, thriving private-sector businesses, and innovative research.  And because that principle – matching defense increases with non-defense increases dollar-for-dollar – was a basic condition of the bipartisan agreement we got in 2013.  The President sees no reason why we shouldn’t uphold those same principles in any agreement now. The only way we’re going to get out of the wilderness of sequestration is if we work together.  I therefore appeal to members of Congress, from both parties, to start looking for ways to find a truly bipartisan compromise.  I hope they can make clear to their colleagues that sequestration would also damage America’s long-term strength, preventing our country from making pro-growth investments in areas ranging from basic research to early childhood education – investments that, in the past, have helped make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Sequestration is set to return in just over 200 days.  Letting that happen would be unwise and unsafe for our national defense, over both the short and long term. Short-Term Impact DoD has had to live with uncertain budgets for the last three years, continuous and sudden downward revisions of our budget plans, and even a government closure.  To continue meeting all of our mission requirements, we’ve done our best to manage through these circumstances, underfunding significant parts of our force and its support systems.  Put bluntly, we have survived, but not thrived.  Our military has made painful choices and tradeoffs among the size, capabilities, and readiness of our joint force, and we’ve amassed a number of bills that are now coming due. That’s why the department has been counting on and planning for a budget increase of roughly $35 billion above sequestration-level caps in Fiscal Year 2016.  If it looks like DoD will be operating at sequestration levels in 2016, on October 1 we will have to swiftly begin making cuts so that we don’t end up $35 billion short as we approach year’s end. A return to sequestration in Fiscal Year 2016 would affect all aspects of the department, but not all equally. More than one-third of the Fiscal Year 2016 cuts would come have to come from Operations and Maintenance accounts, with unavoidable reductions in readiness and our ability to shape world events in America’s interest.  Let me put this more plainly:  allowing sequestration to return would deprive our troops of what they need to accomplish their missions. Approximately half of the cuts would have to come from the department’s modernization accounts, undermining our efforts to secure technological superiority for U.S. forces in future conflicts.  Because there are bills that DoD absolutely must pay – such as the salaries of our troops – many capabilities being developed to counter known threats from highly capable adversaries would be delayed or cancelled, deepening our nation’s vulnerabilities at a time when the world is growing more dangerous, not less.  Sequestration would put a hold on critical programs like our Aerospace Innovation Initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Engine, the Ground-Based Interceptor missile defense kill vehicle redesign, and several space control efforts. Deferring these investments is bad policy and makes the Defense Department less competitive for the future.  What’s more, it breaks faith with the troops of today and the troops of tomorrow.  And it undermines the defense industrial base that is a critical foundation for our national security. Long-Term Impact If sequestration were to persist over time, the long-term consequences would be harder hitting.  We would ultimately have a military that looks fundamentally different, and that performs much differently, from what our nation is accustomed to. If we are forced to sequestration-level budgets, I do not believe that we can continue to make incremental cuts and maintain the same general set of objectives as we’ve had in our defense strategy.  I will insist that new cuts be accompanied by a frank reassessment of our strategic approach to addressing the threats we face around the world – what we are asking the Armed Forces to do and to be prepared to do. I cannot tell you right now exactly what that means – DoD is not resigned to the return of sequestration – but I can tell you that I will direct the department to look at all aspects of the defense budget to determine how best to absorb these cuts.  No portion of our budget can remain inviolate. What I will not do is let DoD continue mortgaging our future readiness and capability.  I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, and ineffective doctrine. Everything else is on the table. What does that mean?  We could be forced to consider pay cuts, not just cuts in the growth of compensation.  We could be forced to consider all means of shedding excess infrastructure, not just working within the Congressional BRAC process.  We could be forced to look at significant force structure cuts, not just trimming around the edges.  We could be forced to ask our military to do – and be prepared to do – significantly less than what we have traditionally expected, and required of it. I am not afraid to ask these difficult questions, but if we are stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. A prolonged period of depressed defense budgets will almost certainly mean a smaller, less capable, and less ready military.  No one can fully predict the impact on the future.  But it could translate into future conflicts that last longer, and are more costly in both lives and dollars. That may sound severe to some, but it is a fact, and history should be our guide when we think about the true cost of sequestration. The Case for Repealing Sequestration I know I’m preaching to the choir here.  If sequestration could have been reversed by just this committee and its counterpart in the House, it probably would have happened years ago.  So I offer the following to Members of the Committee about what you can remind your colleagues when you ask for their vote to repeal sequestration: Remind them that even after the increase we’re asking for, DoD’s budget as a share of total federal spending will still be at a near-historic low – a quarter of what it was during the Korean War, a third of what it was during the Vietnam War, and half of what it was during the Reagan buildup. Remind them that the increased funding is for modernization that’s critical to keeping our military’s technological edge and staying ahead of potential adversaries. Remind them that DoD has hands-on leadership from the very top – me – devoted to using taxpayer dollars better than they’ve been used in the past.  You have my personal commitment to greater accountability, greater efficiency, and running this department better and leaner than before. Remind them that sequestration’s cuts to long-term investments will likely make those investments more costly down the line.  All who bemoan unnecessary Pentagon program delays and the associated cost overruns should know that sequestration will only make these problems worse.  I can easily sympathize with my non-defense counterparts in this regard; knowing how wasteful and inefficient sequestration would be at DoD, I have no doubt the same is true at other departments and agencies as well. Remind them that sequestration’s impact on our domestic budget will cause further long-term damage to our defense – because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military needs strong schools to provide the best people, strong businesses to provide the best weapons and equipment, and strong science and research sectors to provide the best new innovations and technologies. Remind them that we can’t keep kicking this can down the road.  The more we prolong tough decisions, the more difficult and more costly they will be later on.  VI. CONCLUSION The men and women of the Department of Defense are counting on Congress to help assure the strength of our military and American global leadership at a time of great change in the world. We must reverse the decline in defense budgets to execute our strategy and fund a modern, ready, leaner force in a balanced way.  We must seize the opportunity to enact necessary reforms in how we do business.  And we must bring an end to the threat sequestration poses to the future of our force and American credibility around the world. As you evaluate the President’s budget submission, I encourage you and your colleagues to keep it in perspective. In the years since the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 budget request – the benchmark for cuts prescribed under the 2011 Budget Control Act – DoD’s 10-year budget projections have absorbed more than $750 billion in cuts, or more than three-quarters of the trillion-dollar cuts that would be required should sequestration be allowed to run its course.  And while some claim this is our biggest budget ever, the fact is, as a share of total federal spending, DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget is at a near-historic low – representing about 14 percent of total federal discretionary and non-discretionary outlays.  DoD’s total budget remains more than $100 billion below what it was at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was even more complicated than we could have foreseen.  Given today’s security environment – which has over 200,000 American servicemembers stationed in over 130 countries conducting nearly 60 named operations – our proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is a responsible, prudent approach. Some of you may recall how, in 1991, after America’s Cold War victory and amid doubts about America’s engagement with the world and calls for a bigger domestic peace dividend, a bipartisan group in Congress stepped forward to help shape America’ global leadership and make long-term decisions from which we continue to benefit. Senators Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar helped craft, pass, and pay for the small Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that allowed the United States and DoD to provide the funding and expertise to help former Soviet states decommission their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles. The Nunn-Lugar program was initially opposed abroad, and there were also doubts at the Pentagon about whether we could implement it without losing track of funding.  I know.  I helped lead the program in its early years.  But with slow and diligent effort by American defense officials, the Congress, and our foreign partners, it worked. It helped prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands.  It helped establish a pattern of international cooperation and global norms in the post-Cold War international order.  And, in the light of the current instability in Ukraine, it might have staved off several variants of nuclear disaster. But it also set an important precedent for our work on this budget and in the years ahead.  It shows what Congressional conviction – especially when it is bipartisan – can accomplish in foreign policy.  It shows the value of foresight and planning for an uncertain future.  And it shows how spending a relatively few dollars today can generate huge value down the line. As the new Secretary of Defense, I hope it will be possible to again unite behind what our great nation should do to protect our people and make a better world, and provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they deserve. Thank you. ",Submitted Statement -- Senate Armed Services Committee (Budget Request),https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606647/submitted-statement-senate-armed-services-committee-budget-request/
"April 22, 2015","Good morning, everybody. Thank you, COL [Michael] Donahue – appreciate that – for your kind words, and for your leadership of the Hoya Battalion. This is a great crowd, a big crowd for what’s – for many universities and many subsets of the student body – would probably be an early morning. But not for you all, and certainly not for me.  We have cadets here.  We have midshipmen here from Georgetown, the University of Maryland, Howard University, George Mason, and George Washington University all here today. Wonderful – it's a privilege to be with you. The reason our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known is its people.  And taking care of our people…whether that’s in Afghanistan, on bases around the country, or studying here in the nation’s capital…taking care of them is my highest priority.  And I want to thank you, each and every one of you – you and your families – for your hard work and your service. As you know, there’s a lot going on in the world…and a lot on my plate as Secretary of Defense.  We have challenges in Afghanistan, with ISIL, Russian provocations, cyber attacks.  We’re also working to reform how the Pentagon spends money, recover from 14 years of war, and – at the same time – build the force of the future. All of that is in front of us.  It’s serious business…and I know all of you – and all those American men and women in uniform, all over the world, who will hear this message – take it seriously.  And we can’t let problems, including the scourge of sexual assault in the ranks, undermine that important work and our vital mission.  Instead, we have to confront them. Ending sexual assault in the military won’t be easy.  But none of you signed up for easy...instead, you signed up for ROTC.  And in doing so, you volunteered for early mornings, plenty of runs on the Mall, weekends in the field, and classwork on top of already demanding course loads. Ending sexual assault in the military will require leaders…leaders like you.  You are part of ROTC programs with rich histories of leadership.  Those commissioned out your programs have led troops into battle, become flag officers, served as Army Chief of Staff, and advised presidents and Secretaries of Defense. You made clear you were a leader the moment you chose ROTC, and you’ll be some of our brightest and best-prepared junior officers when you are commissioned.  Because you’re studying in Washington at a time when sexual assault has gotten much deserved attention on campuses, in government, and in military conversations, you will have the understanding and the urgency to be leaders on this issue – as well as leaders in every other way – for years to come. And I am counting on you to become one of those leaders. Now even though sexual assault is a disgrace in any form, it happens too often across the country, including on college campuses…it’s a particular challenge and a particular disgrace to our institution – the military – for a few very important reasons. The first is that our military is based on an ethos of honor, and this is dishonorable.  And second, we’re based on trust.  We have to have trust.  You have to trust in the soldier in the foxhole next to you.  You have to trust in the sailor you’re underway with.  You have to trust in the airmen on your wing.  And you have to trust in the Marine on your flank.  And these violations and these assaults are not just violations of the law, they are violations of that trust, which is essential to our mission. Next, we, of course, have to put people in situations that are unlike any other.  You serve – all serve in a rigid chain of command, and for good reasons.  You’ll likely be separated from your families for extended periods of time.  And you’ll probably, at some point, live and work in austere conditions.  Those types of environments are essential.  But unfortunately, they present opportunities for predators to put our people at risk and compromise our missions and our values.  And so, our institution has a particular reason to combat sexual assault. And last, we need to recruit the force of the future, and sexual assault is an issue for many of our potential recruits.  They care about it.  I was at my old high school a few weeks ago in an auditorium like this, talking to students.  And one of the students asked me about this issue.  She asked whether it was safe for her – she wanted to be in the military – was it safe for her to do?  And I was sorry that she had to ask that question.  But anyway, it’s an issue.  And we can’t let sexual assault make our all-volunteer force a less attractive path for the next generation of talented, dedicated individuals that we need. For all of these reasons and the threat sexual assault poses to the well-being of our men and women, the Department of Defense has been working pretty hard on this issue now for the past several years, implementing over 100 congressionally-mandated provisions and fifty Secretary of Defense directives. We’ve made some progress.  We’ve seemed to have seen some decrease in the estimated number of assaults, and we’ve seemed to have seen an increase in those reporting an assault. But last year, we estimated that at least 18,900 servicemembers – 10,400 men and 8,500 women – experienced unwanted sexual contact.  And two of them – too few of them, excuse me…particularly men, reported these incidents as assaults. So, altogether that's 18,900 too many.  No man or woman who serves in the United States military should ever be sexually assaulted. One reason the military is among the most admired institutions in the United States is because of our code of honor and our code of trust, and also because we’re known as a learning organization…we strive to understand and to correct our flaws.  And, as we have spent more time and resources to better understand sexual assault in the ranks, we’ve learned some lessons. And here are a few of them:  We’ve also learned that in addition to all our institutional efforts, eliminating sexual assault requires individual action.  We need leaders in the ranks with the courage to stand up to behaviors that contribute to sexual assault, the courage to step up – step in and stop assaults, and the courage to act when others try to retaliate against those reporting, responding to, or preventing an assault. One key to prevention is to understand that sexual assaults often occur in environments where crude and offensive behavior, unwanted sexual attention, coercion, and sexual harassment are tolerated, ignored, or condoned.  These behaviors detract from our mission and put our people at risk, and you have to be a part of the solution. Now, it won’t always be easy.  But to learn how, I encourage you to take a look at our Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy we released last May.  It provides ways to create – for you as leaders – an appropriate culture, meet standards of behavior, and uphold our military core values. We have serious work to do.  And I need you to say ‘enough’…enough to dirty jokes, to excessive drinking, to hazing, to sexual advances, and to any suggestion that coercion is appropriate.  I need you to intervene when you think an assault may occur.  And, if for some reason you’re concerned about taking action, I need you to get help… from a friend, law enforcement, a chaplain, or from a more senior officer. Sadly, for too many of those assaulted, the crime is made worse by how he or she is treated after the attack…after they’ve reported it. When victims are most vulnerable, their leadership and their fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines need to stand by them in solidarity, not turn their back or turn away.  We need those assaulted to have people they can count on.  It may not be easy, but I need you to be one of them…in person and also online. I know young people live their lives online, in many ways.  You Snapchat…you tweet your every move, you share the day’s news on Facebook, you Instagram pictures from events like the military ball you had this weekend. And that’s why I need you to be leaders not just in the line of duty, but online also.  I trust most of you would intervene if you saw someone being bullied around the campus.  But too many people let that stuff slide online – we know that – and sometimes offline, too.  We can’t allow those who do the right thing – either in reporting an assault or standing up to stop one – to be belittled on Facebook, ignored at chow hall, passed over at promotion time, or mocked in the officer’s club.  That’s counter to the ethos you signed up for.  And it’s just plain wrong. Now, our nation is looking to the Defense Department to lead boldly on sexual assault because they admire our institution and its values and its culture of learning.  And every one of us has to know and do our part. Stopping sexual assault will be a focus of my time as Secretary of Defense.  But as leaders of the future force, I ask that you too make eradicating these crimes one of your personal missions.  Foster a culture of prevention, response, and accountability…dignity, respect, and integrity.  Communicate clearly about what’s right and what’s wrong in everything you do – not just by your words, but also by your actions.  Aim to make a difference in your units, throughout the force, and around the country. None of this is easy, but you won’t be alone.  You’ve made great friends at ROTC and at your schools.  Each of you will be a leader in this effort and support each other in this fight, as in others.  And I want you to know I’m standing with you and expecting that of you. Courage is infectious.  I’ve been impressed by the courage of those who stepped forward with their stories of assault, and the courage of those who stepped in to protect their fellow servicemembers.  Their examples give us all the courage to do our part.  And when you do…because you do…your courage will, in turn, inspire others. Thank you.  And now let me take some questions. ",Remarks by Secretary Carter on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (Georgetown University),https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606665/remarks-by-secretary-carter-on-sexual-assault-prevention-and-response-georgetow/
"April 16, 2015","Good morning, everyone. What a beautiful morning! As you all know, I like to go out and walk the halls of the Pentagon.  I do it to get exercise, I do it to get out of the office, and I walk around to see how the place is doing – and how you all are doing.  On those walks, I see a lot of portraits.  Every hallway here serves as a reminder of the men and women who have served our great nation.  Some of the faces are well-known…we have, in fact, Mel Laird to thank for the portraits that line the Secretary of Defense’s corridor.  And some of the portraits are of long ago soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. This morning, it’s my honor to help unveil the latest addition: the portrait of Leon Panetta…the 23rd Secretary of Defense.  Mr. Secretary, welcome back to the Pentagon. And I’d like to extend a warm welcome to the many Panetta friends and family and colleagues here today – including Jimmy…Jimmy, thanks for your service to this country.  And thank you for your love and support for your dad. And thank you, distinguished guests and former leaders of the department who have joined us here on this beautiful and festive morning. Leon’s beloved golden retriever Bravo is also here today.  Now much to Secretary Panetta’s dismay, his press secretary once mistakenly told a Washington Post reporter that Bravo is an Irish setter.  Once the staffer was himself out of the doghouse, he gave Leon a shirt for Bravo that read: “Hi, I’m Bravo, and I’m working undercover as an Irish setter.” Bravo, your cover – I fear – is blown for good now, but I’d like to thank you also for your support for Leon. Today, we recognize the affable and able son of Italian immigrants who has done so much to secure the American dream for so many, for so long; an American whose service to this country spanned more than forty years in roles from soldier to statesman; and a Secretary of Defense who led DoD at a time of great change for our military, the United States, and the world. I have worked for eleven secretaries of defense, and each brought his own unique traits to this challenging office.  Secretary Panetta’s unparalleled political acumen served him – and all of DoD – well in that time of change.  His infectious laugh made difficult meetings – even those about sequester – far easier to manage.  And his sense of openness and inclusion, at all levels of DoD, brought out the best of those who work here.  And behind all of that formidable ability, you always knew there was a big heart for the troops – and for the welfare of America. Leon more than met his commitment to protect our servicemembers, and the nation.  During his tenure, he helped bring our combat mission in Iraq to an end, begin the drawdown in Afghanistan, and continue to hand Al-Qaeda debilitating losses, following on his signature achievement at CIA: the raid that brought an end to Osama bin Laden. Recognizing the contributions of gays, lesbians, and women to the nation's security, Leon made sure that the military lived up to the values of our society, making it more respectful and inclusive.  He completed, as he said, the successful repeal of “Don't Ask, Don't Tell,” and was the first Secretary of Defense to speak directly to gay and lesbian service members in public remarks.  And in one of his final acts in office, he lifted DoD's combat ban on women. Recognizing the Asia-Pacific’s growing importance and its dynamic security environment, Leon announced that 60 percent of our Navy would be homeported in the region.  He bolstered relationships with friends and allies.  And he paved the way for Marine Corps rotations to Darwin, Australia. Recognizing the need to adapt our military for future challenges, Leon envisioned ways to confront emerging threats.  He oversaw the development of a new defense strategy that marked, as he said, “an historic shift to the future.”  And he helped DoD take seriously the challenges that both we, and the nation, face in cyberspace. When I served as his deputy, we had the chance to work very closely together – just about as closely as any Secretary and Deputy could.  Leon said that he wanted me to be his “alter-ego,” but I liked to say that while Leon worked the bridge, I manned the engine room. Leon, now that I’m up on that bridge, I value the strong foundation you built on all of these issues – in the past few weeks I have focused on building the force of the future, implementing the next phase of the rebalance, and leading DoD’s approach to cybersecurity – and many others things.  Through all that, I am reminded how well you were served by a robust sense of humor.  And I am beginning to understand – beginning to understand – why your language was so salty…or so frickin’ salty. I often said that having Leon Panetta as Secretary of Defense was like going to a big Italian family dinner and the table stretched on for miles and miles and miles.  And down that table were the millions and millions of men and women who served this great department.  And at the end of that table sat a big, proud, comforting leader and father, Leon Panetta.  All of us – from the senior leaders on the E-Ring to the most junior servicemembers around the world – felt palpably just how much he cared for this Department and the men and women who serve in it.  And we now have the family portrait to remember him by. Leon, we thank you for your service, your vision, and your leadership.  And I look forward to seeing your portrait on my walks – a daily reminder of your friendship and your contributions to the Department of Defense. Thank you. ",Portrait Unveiling for Secretary Leon Panetta,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606663/portrait-unveiling-for-secretary-leon-panetta/
"Aug. 28, 2014","Thank you. Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, we first want to tell you how grateful we are that you are here. We are all here first to thank Bill and Georgeann McRaven for their exceptional leadership and their commitment to this country, to the people they lead, and the values that they care about. Their exceptional leadership for US Special Operations Command is a tribute to all of you who serve this country, and a special tribute to them. We're here also to welcome Michele and Joe Votel and their family. A full account of Admiral McRaven’s military career has yet to be written.  When it is, however, it will have to be heavily redacted.  But his legacy in the special operations community is already pretty secure.  He is a warrior-leader that generations of special operators from across the branches of all of our services will strive to emulate in every way. Bill McRaven’s career has been deeply intertwined with the history of special operations in this country in every way.  He helped establish and was in the first graduating class of the Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict curriculum at the Naval Post Graduate School.  He literally wrote the book on Special Operations – and I’m told that his graduate school thesis, which I've not read, at one point outranked even Clausewitz on Amazon’s list of Military Strategy bestsellers. As the commander for Special Operations in Europe, he was the driving force behind the creation of the NATO Special Operations Forces Coordination Centre.  And under his leadership, the Joint [Special] Operations Command carried out perhaps the most important mission in their history – hunting down and killing Osama bin Laden. As SOCOM Commander, Admiral McRaven has led a community transitioning from its essential role in the post-[9]/11 wars to confronting the next generation of challenges – dynamic, dispersed, and networked, and very dangerous. Special operators have long been the vanguard of our military’s global engagement, representing the kind of far-reaching work that our military will be called upon to do more and more in the future.  Under Admiral McRaven's command, SOCOM personnel have deployed to over 150 countries. What special operators do every day not only helps make America safer, the world better, it also directly contradicts the uninformed and false narrative that somehow the United States is pulling back from the world.  In fact, SOCOM and the entire U.S. military are more engaged internationally than ever before – in more places and with a wider variety of missions. For example, under Admiral McRaven’s leadership, our special operations Forces swiftly provided life-saving relief after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines.  They helped Peruvian forces successfully target two senior members of the Shining Path rebel group.  They’re working with African partners now to help counter the terrorist activities of Boko Haram.  In Iraq, special operators on the ground are helping strengthen Iraqi security forces in their fight against ISIL.  And in Eastern Europe, they are reinforcing NATO allies in light of Russian aggression in Ukraine. For the past three years, Admiral McRaven has organized his forces to be more agile, more flexible, and more responsive.  He has better integrated SOCOM with the geographic Combatant Commands, some as you know are here today, and issued the first-ever Global Campaign Plan for Special Operations.  He has deepened our relationships abroad, in a very positive way, working more closely with allies and partners to better anticipate and counter threats.  As a testament to the growing demand for special operators, SOCOM has grown by almost 8,000 people over the past three years – and its growth will continue even as other parts of our military draw down. The relentless pace of deployments has put a heavy burden on this community, on all of our military communities, and the McRavens, both Georgeann and Bill, have worked tirelessly to help alleviate much of this strain.  Bill established initiatives to address the physical and mental well-being of his force, offer support to family members, and provide more predictability on deployments.  He modified SOCOM’s definition of readiness to include families as a vital part of that equation, something the entire Department of Defense can learn from.  Georgeann, with over three decades as a military spouse, you have been consistent in your advocacy for SOF families and you have personally supported many of these important initiatives.  The McRavens live by the SOF community’s saying, that our people are most important, our people are more important than our hardware. The University of Texas recently announced that Bill will become their next Chancellor.  As a Nebraskan, I'm sorry. Actually, I told the Admiral I'm happy we have now left the Big 12 with Texas, because I know when McRaven shows up, things will change everywhere, as they always do.  UT’s selection of Bill, however, speaks to his ability, clear ability, respected ability, to lead and inspire those around him.  That's been the story of his life, his career. As we bid farewell to Admiral McRaven and Georgeann, we know that we have a most worthy successor in Joe Votel.  General Votel’s quiet, decisive leadership – combining both operational and strategic expertise – is what this command will need as we confront the next generation of very dangerous and complicated threats to our country and our national security. Like Admiral McRaven, General Votel knows that an institution is only as strong as its people. So let me close by paying tribute to all of you who do so much for this country, paying tribute to the exceptional people that Admiral McRaven so brilliantly led, and who General Votel is now charged to lead. To all our special operators, thank you for the sacrifices you make for your country, particularly over the past 13 years of fighting in two grueling, long wars.  Your skill, your agility, and your dedication are what make you so often the choice of our forces for our highest priority missions.  And a special thank-you to your families, who make untold sacrifices and never get the amount of recognition and appreciation they deserve. In a complicated and combustible world, this community is a precious national asset.  All Americans are inspired by your strength, your determination, and your absolute devotion to duty.  Admiral McRaven, General Votel, we are tremendously proud of both you and your families, and your stewardship of this community, and all you have commanded. And to many of our leaders who were announced today at the beginning of this ceremony, I thank you on behalf of President Obama, our country, for your leadership, and for the men and women under your commands and what you do for our country. To members of the Florida congressional delegation and other political leaders here, thank you for your support of our men and women and this institution. We are grateful for that support and we are grateful for your partnership. Thank you all, and God bless you.

"Oct. 11, 2016","Thank you, Minister Sajjan.  And thank you, Minister Dillon, for welcoming us to your country.  To you, and all my fellow ministers:  It’s a pleasure to be here at this year’s Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas. I’m also pleased to be joined by my Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Dr. Rebecca Bill Chavez, and Admiral Kurt Tidd, commander of United States Southern Command.  I know they’ve worked closely, and worked well, with each of you and your militaries.  And I’m grateful to both of them for their hard work. As all of you know, in April 2009, here in Port-of-Spain at the Summit of the Americas, President Obama began a new era of engagement for the United States in the Western Hemisphere.  Because the future of the United States is “inextricably bound” to the future of our entire hemisphere, he committed that going forward, there would be “no senior partner and junior partner in our relations,” instead, “engagement [would be] based on mutual respect” and the interests and principles all our nations share. Over the past seven years, our countries have come together in new ways – economically, politically, and also militarily.  And I’ve come here today to discuss the next steps we can take together, because the partnership we’ve built among our defense establishments continues to be the foundation of our shared security in this hemisphere – our hemisphere. Indeed, since 2009 we’ve entered a new era of increased cooperation.  As part of this new era, nations and militaries across our hemisphere have been doing more, and in more ways, to the benefit of all – contributing unilaterally, and multilaterally, to greater security in the region and beyond. As a hemisphere, we’ve made progress in several important areas.  For example, we’re leaders when it comes to peacekeeping.  Today, Brazil continues to lead the UN stabilization mission in Haiti, and commands the maritime forces for the UN in Lebanon.  Chile, Uruguay, El Salvador, Peru, and others have also emerged as key contributors – increasingly making critical contributions to peacekeeping missions in Haiti and Africa, sometimes supported by U.S. pre-deployment training and equipment. Next, our hemisphere has also improved defense institutions and governance.  Guatemala has been a leader both in strengthening its own defense ministry, and in sharing expertise with its neighbors.  Colombia is also undertaking significant defense reforms, and as Colombians make progress toward ending the longest-running conflict in our hemisphere, we welcome their strong contributions to both regional and global security. And finally, we’ve made progress in how we respond to disasters.  Chile and Mexico, for example, have been working with countries across Central America to build capacity in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  Also, earlier this year, after the devastating earthquake in Ecuador, many countries in our hemisphere, including the United States, stepped up to support civilian agencies – with the U.S. Air Force deploying a mobile air traffic control tower that enabled more food, water, and supplies to reach those in need. And just this past week, when Hurricane Matthew struck parts of the Caribbean, Colombia, and parts of the United States, the region was stepping up again to help.  Last week the U.S. military was quick to support our civilian U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, standing up a joint task force and sending helicopters, engineers, and other assets to help with relief efforts in Haiti.  And other countries are responding as well – Colombia, for example, sent its offshore patrol vessel 7th of August to Haiti to help provide humanitarian assistance. All this represents tremendous progress – we’ve made our hemisphere more secure and grown stronger as partners.  We must now build on that progress together, including in two areas I will mention today:  natural disasters, and the need for institutional reform. First, disasters like Hurricane Matthew underscore that many of the challenges we face, like climate change – which is on the agenda at CDMA again this year – don’t respect national or regional boundaries.  And whether it’s a storm, an earthquake, or rising sea levels, such disasters can create an immense burden on our militaries and security forces, highlighting the need for increased cooperation. We’re all in this hemisphere together, and when we plan and prepare together, we’re better at responding when disaster strikes.  That’s why the United States supports the proposal for CDMA to develop a hemisphere-wide approach on multilateral disaster response.  For its part, the United States will increase its funding to help nations in our hemisphere build their military capacity to support civilian authorities with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and to facilitate even closer cooperation both regionally and sub-regionally. The second area is defense institutional reform, which helps make our militaries more capable in their mission of defending our countries and making a better world for our children.  Here, the United States is committed to sharing lessons we’ve learned in our own reform efforts, and we’re committed to helping countries who also wish to do so to strengthen their defense institutions.  We’re all constantly transforming.  And as I’ve been working hard to improve the U.S. Defense Department, I know we can learn something from your countries as well. To exchange lessons learned, the United States already partners with several countries here on defense reform, and based on increased demand, we intend to broaden these efforts in scale and scope – including through DoD’s Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies. The United States would like to expand this institutional engagement with other nations as well, so we can share best practices and help each other become more capable.  That will enable our militaries to operate together more effectively – making our hemisphere stronger, and more secure. Let me close by saying that the challenges we face in the Western Hemisphere are ones we all must come together to meet.  And we must do so consistent with shared principles – principles our countries agreed to over 20 years ago at the first CDMA in Williamsburg, Virginia. It’s a complex world – in the U.S. Defense Department, for example, we’re addressing five major, very different, and evolving challenges, from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism, and we’re also preparing to contend with an uncertain security future – but this hemisphere is a relative oasis of stability and freedom.  I know that doesn’t come freely, and I don’t take it for granted – it’s a credit to the efforts of the people in this room that our hemisphere is so full of bright opportunity.  Through partnership such as this room represents and what we agree on, let’s keep it that way and seize those wonderful opportunities that lie before all of us in the future. Thanks to the partnership we’ve built among our nations, what we have and will agree to at this conference represents historic promise – the opportunity to shape a future that can be more prosperous and more secure for all our citizens.  Let us now go forward and do so together. Thank you.

"May 18, 2016","What a great honor it is for me to administer the Oath of Office to Eric Fanning, one of our finest and most accomplished public servants as he becomes Secretary of the Army today. Over the course of my career, it has been a privilege to work alongside Eric now -- we were just saying -- many years, and watch him develop into one of our country’s most knowledgeable, dedicated, and experienced civil servants.  And over the past several years I’ve seen firsthand why Eric Fanning is one of this Administration’s most trusted and capable appointees and one of the Pentagon’s most dependable civilian leaders. When Eric served as my chief of staff when I first became Secretary of Defense, I looked to him to help me recruit and attract a talented and innovative team of civilian and military leaders, many of whom are with us today.  Eric also understands the Army well, and having served more over in three senior leadership roles in each of the services, he understands the pivotal connections that bind them all together.  From his service in positions of responsibility on non-proliferation issues and weapon of mass destruction, to his proven leadership in resource management, Eric understands the full spectrum of responsibilities and opportunities that we confront as a 21st century military. As Secretary of the Army, Eric will strengthen the Army’s unparalleled ability, forged over the last 15 years, to seize, hold, and dominate physical and human terrain.  But I know Eric is also a leader who is never satisfied and always innovative.  I know he won’t rest on the current excellence of our Army; he will double down on it, ensuring that our ground forces are agile, unrivaled in posture, full spectrum ready, and always ready to defend America’s interests and values. Eric embodies the kind of strong and steady servant leadership and civilian commitment to our men and women in uniform that have made our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And I look forward to working with him as he strengthens our Army, builds on its best traditions, and prepares our ground forces to confront a new generation of challenges. Of course, the strength of our force is built upon strong civilian-military relations.  And General Milley is no stranger to trusted teamwork, whether playing hockey at Princeton – and I know you and Eric might have a friendly rivalry in a Princeton-Dartmouth way – or commanding a battalion in the regiment made famous by Band of Brothers, Mark has always been, not only a gifted warrior, but a consummate team-player.  I know how pleased he is to have Eric, as I sure am, finally on board and to be part of a now complete team tasked with winning the nation’s wars. Eric, I know it’s been a long time waiting and it’s been a long time coming.  But I think we can all say today: it’s been worth the wait.  By the way, I won’t justify that wait.  By any means it had nothing to do with Eric.  But I’m glad it’s over.  And I want to thank you for your patience and fortitude during this process. And I also want to give my special appreciation to Patrick Murphy, a combat veteran who’s never lost sight of our most important commitment, and that’s to the people of our force.  He has done an excellent job as Acting Secretary over these past months and I look forward to continuing to work with him as Undersecretary of the Army. Patrick, we’re all in your debt. In so many ways the people of the Pentagon have always been innovators, adapting to the next generation of challenges, expanding the opportunity to fight for our country to all Americans who can meet our rigorous standards -- innovating in our operations, in our strategy, in how we manage ourselves, how we manage our people. And so it’s now my great honor to administer the Oath of Office to one of those leaders and innovators, one who will undoubtedly strengthen our force, and, as he becomes Secretary of the Army today, is one more reflection of the founding promise of this great country. Eric, come on up--I will administer the Oath to you:  ",Remarks before Administering the Oath of Office to Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/781251/remarks-before-administering-the-oath-of-office-to-secretary-of-the-army-eric-f/
"July 29, 2015","Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. And with your leave, I think that you preferred, and that’s fine with us, if only I and General Dempsey make opening statements… Thank you, Ranking Member Reed, thank you all of the Members of the Committee for giving me the opportunity to testify this morning on our defense strategy toward this critical region, in the wake, as Senator Reed noted, of my travels to the region last week, the Chairman’s also, and of course very importantly two weeks after the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  I am pleased to be joined by my fellow Cabinet members who can talk in detail about that agreement reached in Vienna. That deal is an important step …one brought about by the leadership of President Obama, the persistent diplomacy of Secretaries Kerry, Moniz and others, crippling sanctions that Secretary Lew led and that Congress helped put in place. It’s a good deal, because it prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon in a comprehensive and verifiable way.  Once implemented, it will therefore remove a critical element of risk and uncertainty – one element of risk and uncertainty, but a critical element of risk and uncertainty – from the region.  For those reasons, and those my colleagues have provided in testimony before other Congressional committees, I urge you to support it.  I also urge you to support the broader elements of the defense strategy in the Middle East I will describe, including and especially by supporting a stable and reformed defense budget to implement it. The successful negotiation of this deal is one part of our broader foreign and defense policy.  As the most influential power in the world, we have responsibilities all over the globe.  The Middle East remains important to America’s national interests.  And, as a result, the Department of Defense is committed to confronting the region’s two principal security challenges: Iran and ISIL. The Department’s strategic approach to protecting our interests and confronting those challenges will remain unchanged. We will continue to maintain a strong military posture to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; to check Iran’s malign influence; and to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.  We're also continuing to advance our military capabilities that provide all options, as the President has directed, should Iran walk away from its commitments under this deal. Last week, I was in the Middle East, and I had the opportunity to visit with some of our men and women in uniform who are carrying out this strategy.  I know how much all of you care for them, and like me, you are proud of their impressive work.  And I’ll tell you this morning what I told them: we’re continuing full speed ahead – standing with our friends, standing up to ISIL, and standing against Iran’s malign activity. On ISIL, as I testified earlier this month, we have the right strategy in place – built on nine, synchronized lines of effort – to achieve ISIL’s lasting defeat.  But we continue to strengthen execution.  Today, in Iraq and other places, we’re working – with partners on the ground and in a global coalition – to enable capable and motivated ground forces to win back Iraq’s sovereignty and peace on its own territory.  I saw several parts of that effort last week and spoke with some of our partners on the ground.  We're headed in the right direction in this counter-ISIL effort: we've made some progress; but we need to make more. On Iran, this new deal – when implemented – will place significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb.  But it is also important to note that it places no limitations – let me repeat that, no limitations – on what the Department of Defense can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance. If Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities, married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports the Assad regime in Syria, backs Hizballah in Lebanon – whose fighting positions, by the way, I observed firsthand during a visit to Israel’s northern border last week with the Israeli Defense Minister – and is contributing to disorder in Yemen.  And Iran still directs hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel. In the face of that malign activity, we will continue to meet our commitments to our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, and continue to build on and enhance our cooperation in meaningful ways.  I made that clear last week in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq.  I also made clear that we will continue to maintain our robust regional force posture ashore and afloat, which includes tens of thousands of American personnel and our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets. Our friends understand, despite our differences with some of them about the merits of this deal, that we have an enduring commitment to deterrence and to regional security.  I’m proud to say that our defense partnerships in the region have never been stronger.  And, as I made clear in Israel and as we agreed at Camp David with our Gulf partners as Senator Reed indicated, we’re committed to making them even stronger and more capable against a range of threats. The United States will maintain its ironclad commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge or QME.  We will keep providing Israel with advanced capabilities – for example, next year, Israel will be our first and only friend in the region flying the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  We continue to work with Israel on ballistic missile defense systems. In fact, three of them: the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and the Arrow system for missiles of progressively increasing range. And we are working multilaterally and bilaterally to improve the capability [and] capacity of our Gulf partners also.  At the GCC Summit at Camp David hosted by the President in May, and last week with Saudi leaders, I stressed a number of functional areas that will be critical to enabling Gulf countries to play a stronger regional role: including maritime forces, ground forces including especially special operations and counterterrorism forces, air and ballistic missile defense forces, and cyber protection.  We also conduct over 50 military exercises a year with our regional partners.  And, we've offered sophisticated defense equipment, including the THAAD ballistic missile defense system and long-range precision strike capabilities, to some of our Gulf partners. In conclusion, this is a good deal because it removes a continued source of threat and uncertainty in a comprehensive and verifiable way by preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  It’s a deal that takes no option away from a future President.  This is an important achievement and a deal that deserves your support. Meanwhile, the United States, the Department of Defense, and the men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known, with your support, will continue to be committed to the defense of America’s interests, friends, and allies, to counter ISIL and Iran’s malign influence, and to uphold the President’s commitment that Iran will not obtain a nuclear weapon should it walk away from this deal. Thank you.

"Oct. 17, 2014","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you and good evening. This is just like the Pentagon. Nothing changes. First, I want to thank this magnificent organization, the USO, which I had an opportunity to be part of many years ago. And I want to thank you all for what you do to support the USO and how important you are to this organization, because it’s so important to our men and women who serve this country and to their families and to the communities, no matter where they are in the world. I want to also thank the senior leadership of our defense enterprise who are with you tonight; thank them for their leadership, their contributions, their sacrifice to this country. This is a special group of men and women. That’s why, of course, the USO was formed many years ago – to not just help them, but to recognize them and to thank them. This time in which we live is as challenging and uncertain and complicated as I suspect any time during our lifetimes. So the strength of the USO – the vibrancy, the character, the values that you bring as you connect and help and bring comfort to our men and women in uniform and their families – is particularly important. Uncertain times always reach out for a certain certainty in our lives, and you represent that. I want to thank the enlisted men and women who are being honored tonight and everyone here who serves his or her country and who has served his or her country. I had an opportunity to meet with your new president, J.D. Crouch, last week. I’ve known J.D. for many years. He will be a terrific leader for this institution. You’ve had many good leaders in this institution. Sloan Gibson went on and continues to make big contributions to his country. And as I said in my opening remarks, I’m very proud that I had a small part to play in helping continue to build this institution many years ago. And I have been a strong supporter since – not just as Secretary of Defense, but as a former soldier, but probably more importantly as an American. All of America recognizes you and what you do and how important you are. And I don’t think we can overstate that. At a time when we question institutions, we question leadership, we question so much about our daily lives, a certain amount of confidence and trust and loyalty in institutions is key to holding a society together. It is the glue. It is the fiber on which societies are built and sustained and improved, to give all our men and women opportunities. And the defense of our country is as high a calling as there is. So to all of you tonight, thank you. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say hello and welcome you. And I, again, want to congratulate those men and women who are being recognized tonight, but all of you sitting out there who do so much for our country every day. And in particular, again, the leadership of the Defense Department, our military services who are represented here tonight. Have a good time. It’s a fun night. It’s a night of celebration. It’s a night of recognition. And it’s a night to say to each other, we appreciate you. And we don’t do that enough. We don’t do that enough in this town. We don’t do it enough, I think, in our country. So it’s a special night for all of you, and thank you. Good night.

"Sept. 8, 2016","Good evening. I want to thank Secretary Fallon for his kind introduction. And I want to thank the United Kingdom for hosting this important – and first of its kind – United Nations Peacekeeping Defense Ministerial. Earlier today at Oxford University, I spoke with students about how, in a changing world, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other like-minded nations must continue to stand together and stand up for the values and the principled international order that have, for decades, helped make a better world. In Prime Minister May and Defense Secretary Fallon, the UK has leaders who are committed to doing so; their hosting this conference is just one example of that commitment. And for all of us, they are good friends and the right partners at a time of great change in the world. I’m pleased to be here this evening with so many of the United States’ – and my own – friends, allies, and partners. Many of us have grown up together over our years in the international defense community…working together to protect our people and make a better world for our children. Of course, it’s a very rare occasion to gather this many Defense Ministers in one room. And there are two important reasons why so many of us are here. First is the United Nations. My friend Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who could not be here this week, Under Secretary Generals Ladsous and Khare, and their teams have worked with each of our nations to increase the potential and the power of UN peace operations. And the second reason we’re here is that we believe in the importance of UN Peacekeeping and the value of peace operations. We do so for humanitarian reasons, but also because, as defense officials, we appreciate that it is more efficient and effective to prevent the development of serious dangers, rather than confronting them later on. We’ve learned that lesson time and again, sometimes the hard way, from the aftermath of World War II right up through to today. And we must remember it at a time of global change and instability, when the need for and importance of peace operations will only grow. Today’s world requires our brave peacekeepers to take real but necessary risks to help end, and, most importantly, prevent conflict. That is why it’s imperative that all our nations and militaries contribute more to these operations, and that we improve how we conduct them. I’d like to speak with you tonight about both those important efforts, and about the contributions the United States is making to UN Peacekeeping. Of course, we’re having this conversation at a time and in a security environment that, like so much else in our lives, is rapidly changing. Indeed, thanks to the work of many of your nations and militaries and your adherence to the principles I mentioned earlier, the people of the world have generally grown healthier, freer, richer, and safer over the past 75 years. And the world has become more prosperous and dynamic as a result. All that change – economic, political, military, social, and technological…personal and national…regional and global – has produced many opportunities for our nations, but it has also created challenges and crises as well. As so, today, the U.S. Defense Department, which I lead and represent here, is focused on five immediate, major, evolving challenges. In Europe, the Defense Department is standing with America’s NATO allies and taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression while also leaving the door open to working with Russia where our shared interests align. In the vital Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. military is a committed partner in building a principled and inclusive security network of nations, many of whom are represented here, to ensure every nation in that dynamic region – every nation – can continue to rise and prosper. Meanwhile, the Defense Department is also strengthening its deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations. The U.S. military is also checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, all while standing with friends and allies in the region. And, the Defense Department is continuing to counter and defeat terrorism – in particular, accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it metastasizes around the world. Many of your nations are helping meet these challenges, particularly that last one. And on behalf of the United States, I thank you for your commitment and contributions to the counter-ISIL campaign. I convened the Defense Ministerial of the Counter-ISIL Coalition for the very first time last year, and we united around a campaign plan which we are systematically executing. Since then and thanks to the contributions and sacrifices of our local partners in Iraq,
Syria, and elsewhere and servicemembers from across this coalition, our campaign has accelerated, pressuring and squeezing ISIL, and rolling it back towards Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. The challenge posed by ISIL demonstrates how small, local insurrections can grow into global threats: endangering innocent civilians at the source, and widening to threaten the people and homelands of many of our nations. And today, with several places – fragile and conflict affected states – where local dangers might grow into global threats, the importance of UN Peacekeeping and the demand for it are understandably growing. But peacekeeping itself is also changing in this new era….growing more difficult, demanding, and dangerous and its missions more far-reaching. Like many of you, I’ve seen that progression over the course of my own career – from the 1970s and 80s when the Cold War still cast a shadow over peacekeeping in interstate conflict…through the 1990s, when tragedies in Rwanda and Bosnia shamed the world into transforming how we make and keep peace…to the
missions in the current era, where our ambitions and our peacekeepers’ skills are being tested more and more in intrastate conflicts with, between, and among non-state actors. Decades ago, peacekeepers were typically sent to permissive environments to monitor an agreed-upon peace between warring parties. As you all know, today’s peacekeepers confront ruthless groups and violent extremists who flout the laws of war and who are fighting in more ways and in more domains than ever before. Indeed, today’s peacekeepers serve in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, and make tremendous sacrifices, including many who make the ultimate sacrifice. What’s more, decades ago, peacekeepers served mostly to keep adversaries separated. Now their assignments run the gamut from facilitating peace agreements and protecting civilians to stopping violence and preventing atrocities – sometimes all the way to countering insurgencies. Today’s fast-moving and dangerous missions also require quick and effective decisions…often about the use of force…and often made, if not amid the fog of war than amid the fog of an uncertain peace. And, we’ve also seen that making peace today is only the start, for the UN and for operations like our counter-ISIL campaign. To make peace lasting – to make it stick – we must also enable sustainable progress. When the fighting stops, we must collaborate with all of our partners – diplomatic and economic, law enforcement and civilian, international and local – to help communities and nations transition and recover from conflict. That’s the linchpin to lasting peace and security. It’s clear that peacekeeping in the modern world will require more of our peacekeepers, our missions, and our operations leaders. But it will also require more of each of us in this room, and the militaries we have the honor and responsibility to lead. We all must make additional contributions, and make important improvements to UN Peacekeeping. For its part, the United States – even as it’s responding to the five challenges I mentioned earlier, and underwriting stability and security in every region across the globe – is continuing America’s longstanding, robust financial support for UN peacekeeping. Contributing over $2 billion dollars in 2016, the United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. At the historic Leaders’ Summit that President Obama convened last year, the U.S. made nine additional commitments. And I have made it a priority in the Pentagon to implement those that require the action of the Defense Department, as have Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Ambassador Samantha Power in their respective domains. In the spirit of the Michael Fallon’s purpose in convening this summit, let me now offer you a progress report on what the Defense Department has done to make good on President Obama’s commitments. First, the United States has been finalizing plans to double the number of senior and seasoned American military officers – working with the UN to place some 40 officers with specific skills in planning and logistics and other important areas – that will serve in UN peace operations. Second, through a new logistical support framework, the U.S. government is able to rapidly provide critical capabilities – like airlift – to UN operations, as we provided parachutes used to airdrop food aid into Syria earlier this year. Third, the United States has also successfully worked with the UN to identify field-tested technologies to solve critical operational challenges, including an interoperable radio system to support communications, as well as the geo-spatial software tool GeoShape and the handheld device Arbiter that support improved situational awareness and decision-making. Fourth, America is training troop contributing countries to counter improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Fifth, the United States is training UN staff to develop and conduct table-top exercises to prepare senior mission leaders – and the UN’s staff has successfully conducted two in-mission exercises so far. And sixth, the Defense Department has finalized our policies and procedures, and now stands ready to provide engineering support to UN peace operations. In addition to meeting last year’s commitments, the United States and the Defense Department are committed to leveraging more than a decade of hard-earned operational experience in austere and dangerous environments to improve the military and operational components of peace operations. So today, I’m proud to announce that the United States is pledging to make additional contributions to UN peacekeeping in five areas. First, to help develop competent and effective senior mission leaders for peace operations, the Defense Department is offering to help train, develop, and prepare future leaders by reinforcing the UN’s Enhanced Leader Development Program. Next, to bring an end to sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, the Defense Department – leveraging our own recent experience trying to rid our force of the scourge of sexual assault – is offering to help enable the UN’s National Investigative Officers and improve training to prevent sexual exploitation and other conduct and discipline issues. Additionally, to help the UN peace operations predict, plan, and secure the capabilities they need in the field, the Defense Department is offering to help synchronize capability development efforts, especially to help fill critical gaps such as counter-IED operations and
medical evacuation. Furthermore, to help UN and troop contributing countries more rapidly deploy units to crisis zones, the Defense Department will leverage our own unique capabilities and recent operational experience to help peacekeepers get on the ground – and get working – more quickly. And finally, to optimize operational and environmental designs for UN Peacekeeping camps and sites, the Defense Department will partner with the UN to improve energy, water, and waste management efficiency.
Taken together, these new commitments, along with last year’s, and our ongoing financial support for UN peacekeeping, demonstrate the priority that President Obama, I, and the entire U.S. government place on peace operations. And I’m here to ask each of you, and your defense institutions, to continue to prioritize it as well. Many nations here tonight have already pledged to contribute additional uniformed personnel and enablers; we applaud your commitment and honor your sacrifices. Thank you for your efforts to deliver these pledges as rapidly as possible. And thank you for looking for additional ways to contribute to this important cause. As we all know, however, new troops, equipment, and support to UN Peacekeeping can only do so much on their own. That’s why we also need to look at – and be honest about – where our operations and peacekeepers have fallen short, and to take steps to improve the diversity, leadership, accountability, and performance of our peace operations. UN forces have grown, and the numbers and diversity of contributing nations is now increasing too. That’s a good thing, as is the increasing role of women peacekeepers. After all, there are some missions and some communities, particularly those with at-risk populations, where women peacekeepers are uniquely positioned to advance peace and security. That’s why having more women peacekeepers is something all of us should strive for because it will both
improve the effectiveness of peace operations and allow us to draw from the widest possible pool of talent that meets our mission standards. And I applaud this ministerial’s focus on the importance of women in peacekeeping. We also have to make some critical reforms to UN Peacekeeping. While this is indeed a dangerous time for peacekeepers, each of us knows from the experiences of our own militaries, difficult missions and dangerous environments do not excuse poor performance, sexual exploitation and abuse, or other unacceptable behavior. UN Peacekeeping has great potential, and together, with important, achievable reforms, we can make it as effective as the world needs it to be. So, as I see it, here’s where we all need to focus: First, as we know from our own militaries, meritocracy works and improves mission effectiveness. That’s why we must select qualified leaders of peace operations missions, and empower them to more effectively manage their forces in complex, austere, and dangerous environments. Second, while each contributing nation must hold its own people accountable, the UN must also ensure the leaders of peace operations and their forces are rigorously assessed against clear standards for their performance, equipment, and conduct. That means consistently underperforming units must be sent home and replaced by someone more committed to the task. And third, we must continue to work to improve performance in operations, both in the field and at UN headquarters in New York. Peacekeepers must be trained, equipped, enabled, and motivated to succeed. We need these three reforms to ensure UN Peacekeeping can succeed in today’s world. And now is the time to make these changes, when the demand for peacekeeping is high and when – thanks to the work of the UN, last year’s summit, and this week’s ministerial – our governments have each renewed their commitment to these missions. The stakes are too high – for those we seek to protect, for our peacekeepers, and for our shared interests – to miss this opportunity for reform. All of this and more will be discussed tomorrow. So let me just close by reviewing one more lesson we’ve been reminded of again and again over the past few decades: none of our countries can do this on our own. With new contributions from each of our nations and much needed reforms, we can responsibly share the growing peacekeeping burden at a time of global change. And we can ensure our peacekeepers can continue to not only prevent local dangers from growing into global crises, but also help provide the citizens of our nations, and others around the world, with the security they need to live their lives, to dream their dreams, to give their children a better future. That is after all, our job. And I’m proud to have colleagues like you here to do mine with. Thank you.

"Feb. 2, 2018","Good morning, everyone and thank you for being here. I would just tell you some things are duty, some things are fun, and this one is fun. It is a pleasure to be presenting today this portrait as we remember a lifetime of service. Secretary Perry – our old boss, for both of us at one point – for the extraordinary effort you made to come here, and I realize you have to fly back halfway around the world when you leave here. Thanks so much. Ambassador Sir Kim Darroch, for all the ambassadors who are here, thank you for coming and reminding us of the connection between our diplomats and our military. Mr. McDonough – can you believe this. It would have caused you great fear, I think, a few short months ago, you know… but thank you so much for being here old friend. Director Clapper, so many of you who are here, Senator Lugar, Congresswoman Harmon, Congressman McKeon, Mr. Adams – where are you, sir? Waive your hand please… Thank you for doing the work that we celebrate here today. You’re a great artist. Over two hundred luminaries are either here or want to be here, and have sent their acknowledgment in writing… public servants, patriots, Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and friends… And I would just tell you, Mr. Secretary, Ash, welcome back and welcome home, for you know this building intimately, to say the least. Over a period of 35 years, here’s a man who served both parties and, count them, 11 secretaries of defense altogether. We’re touched by the unselfish performance of this leader. We honor your service today, Ash, as our secretary, but we keep in mind how you placed your country’s security first, long before destiny tapped you on the shoulder to be our secretary. And destiny did not find you lacking except, perhaps, at age 11 when, I’m told you told your first boss something that caused you to be fired from your first job for “wise-mouthing,” which would not surprise any of us who have been in high council with him. But I would say you were a promising young man and, even then, willing to speak truth to power. You join a long line of academics-turned-guardians of our democracy, in the company of such titans as Paul Nitze and Dr. William Perry. Each of them in their own unique ways served the same end: to frustrate America’s adversaries and defend our experiment in democracy. You did the same thing, Ash, and we cannot be surprised, because you were the son of a World War Two veteran. The defense of this country was put in your DNA. You’re a native of the “city of brotherly love,” and if they win the Super Bowl, we will see it demonstrated in very unusual ways… This is a Philly lad who double-majored in physics and medieval history at Yale, which is the third oldest university in the United States. Then he earned a Rhodes scholarship to study theoretical physics at Oxford, which is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and eventually returning to his native soil with his doctorate in theoretical physics. He then taught that fairly straightforward discipline to other underachievers at no less distinguished a place than Harvard, which is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. There are a lot of elderly things in your resume, sir… But it’s the measure of the man that, having mastered the most rigorous of sciences, Ash Carter placed his razor-sharp mind at the service of his country, beginning the process of becoming the scholar-statesman we honor here today. I first met Ash in 1994, when I was Secretary Perry’s Executive Secretary. Those privileged to serve in the Department of Defense then will recall an international environment nearly unrecognizable from today’s: the Soviet Union’s breakup left nuclear-tipped missiles in silos across former USSR countries, and I had a front row seat to Secretary Perry and his acolyte, Ash Carter, orchestrating the destruction of the old Soviet ICBM silos, plowed over to make room for sunflowers or fields of wheat. That didn’t happen by accident, and it’s good to recall those days, because it came through congressional leadership embodied by Senators Nunn and Lugar. Yet their legislation required someone in the executive branch to turn legislative vision into reality – that’s how our system works and is structured – it takes all of us, working together. Congress legislates; the executive branch executes, and execute Ash did. Secretary Perry turned to him to make things happen, and it’s largely due to Ash that those weapons are not in arsenals today. Mr. Secretary, we and countless others across the continent – and other continents – are eternally grateful to you for the largely unheralded part you played, and that you continue to play, on the defense policy and science boards. Yet, your foresight would not permit you to rest on those laurels. We still recall that your country’s security needs meant that you would be called again to serve as undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. And you applied yourself to those new challenges to support America’s warriors in now a new and radically changed age. Few were surprised when you assumed the role of deputy secretary of defense. Yet as profound as your service proved in your decades of service, you were next but a few weeks at Stanford enjoying a more leisurely pace when the President and destiny tapped you again on the shoulder to return to the colors. I still recall you and I standing there on the sunlit campus as we bid farewell to one another, little knowing that one day we would shake hands again in Washington, DC.  You were on your way back to the Pentagon, and I began praying for you immediately… So it was once more into the fray with you. This time you would be our secretary, a job for which fate or providence had well-prepared you. You came into office facing a grave challenge in the Middle East, as a barbarian caliphate sought to impose its brutality and butchery upon millions. Under your leadership, America’s military summoned the strength to answer this challenge. At the same time, your tenure was marked by a time of new approaches in technology, space and cyberspace, and I know Dr. Perry, you smiled sir, as Ash made his mark in each of those areas – and as our old boss, we know that you were with us all the way… Rest assured this department still bears the indelible imprint of Ash and Dr. Perry’s legacy – that counterproliferation is a priority – and in Silicon Valley where you established DIUx, which was one of my first destinations when I entered this role, and it will live on, and it will prosper. As our National Defense Strategy emphasizes today, America must “expand the competitive space,” and you had identified Silicon Valley as one of America’s reservoirs of strength. In cyberspace – one area that we will do that, for we must not be dominant and at same time irrelevant… We will expand the competitive space there, and the same goes for every competitive domain of warfare – doors that you opened that I will continue to walk through. And your impact has directly benefited me as a result, so I want to say thank you publicly, in front of people who know that I’m not giving false praise here that you did this. Now, we will hang your portrait in the secretary of defense corridor of the Pentagon’s E-ring, where I walk out every night and watch the eyeballs follow me in each of those portraits, and I say ‘give me a break, I’m working on it…’ And all those who come through this magnificent building, with all of the displays which really celebrate the humanity of those who since 1775 have fought for this experiment… Everyone’s going to look at your photo and realize, once again, that when times are at their worst, America can still put forth committed public servants at their best. It’s a reminder that, no matter how tough the times, our free society will always provide the leaders necessary to defend the blessings of liberty in their time and for the future generations whom we owe the same freedoms you and I enjoy today. Secretary Carter, you were one of those who carried this leadership mantle. Thank you for your leadership in a time of peril. And I would like to read a few words from Secretary Panetta, who regrettably could not be here and asked that I recognize his respect for you publicly. He gave me a rather long letter, but he wants to say “thank you for supporting me during my tenure as director of the CIA and, in particular, as my deputy when I was secretary of defense. You have been an impeccable example of how important it is to link moral and emotional intelligence to the formulation of public policy, and how leadership at the highest levels demands a reasonable and civil tone, a suspicion of ideas untested by experience, and the exercise of power, disciplined by integrity.” I think our former secretary sums it up very well. So Mr. Secretary, if you would join me at the portrait… # # # ",Remarks by Secretary Mattis at Portrait Unveiling in Honor of Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1433202/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-portrait-unveiling-in-honor-of-former-secretary/
"Feb. 27, 2018"," Mr. Minister, members of the delegation, Ambassador -- welcome to the Pentagon, and welcome back to America, Mr. Minister. It is good to see our two flags flying together on the steps of the Pentagon, as they should be. Since Montenegro regained its independence in 2006, our two nations have steadily fostered strengthened military-to-military relations, bolstered by shared values between two countries based in democracy. After seeing each other earlier this month at the NATO Defense Ministerial in Brussels, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Montenegro to the NATO alliance. We are very proud and supportive of this, and I’m glad to see you here. As Secretary-General Stoltenberg said during your accession ceremony last June, NATO is “a community of values,” and your country has become “an integral part of that community,” reinforcing our transatlantic unity. The United States is proud to call you our ally, as we stand shoulder-to-shoulder alongside our fellow NATO members against common security threats, like those posed by Russia, as it seeks to redraw international borders by force and seeks veto authority over European diplomatic, economic and security decisions. In the face of such threats, the United States will continue to engage Russia to honor both the letter and spirit of its international commitments. We appreciate Montenegro’s plan to reach two percent defense spending by 2024, sharing the defense burden and ensuring our militaries remains fit for our time. We also appreciate Montenegro’s promise to increase troop contributions to the Mission in Afghanistan. I must recognize that more than 25 percent of your land forces have served in Afghanistan during 16 different rotations. Poet Lord Tennyson’s words on Montenegro from almost two centuries ago still hold true: there are no “mightier mountaineers,” no braver soldiers, than your country’s troops. Today, I look forward to discussing steps to strengthen our military-to-military relationship, including signing a General Security of Information Agreement to enhance our bilateral cooperation. Mr. Minister, welcome – it is good to host you on this, your first and surely not your last visit to the Pentagon. # # # ",Remarks at a Bilateral Meeting with Montenegrin Minister of Defense Boskovic,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1452373/remarks-at-a-bilateral-meeting-with-montenegrin-minister-of-defense-boskovic/
"May 13, 2016","Well, good morning, everyone. And just look at this magnificent crowd. It makes me so proud to be here with you. My friend, Minister Sajjan, General Cienfuegos, Admiral Soberón, Chairman Dunford, members of the NORAD and NORTHCOM team, friends and family, what an honor to be with you here today as we pass this critical command between two of our military's most accomplished leaders, Admiral William Gortney and General Lori Robinson. Before I speak about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary officers, I want to speak directly to you, to the men and women of these vital commands. In the center of our nation, you perform a mission at the center of everything we do as a department. Every day, you work across our military, across our governments, and with our closest neighbors to prepare for contingencies, to provide missile defense, keep our skies free from danger. And you're also responsible for keeping our most solemn commitment as a military, to provide our citizens here at home the security they need to dream their dreams, raise their children, live full lives. Your missions here at NORAD and NORTHCOM are diverse, and challenges that you and the department face are many. In fact, today, we face no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving challenges - countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's nuclear provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Persian Gulf, and accelerating the defeat of ISIL and its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it's metastasizing around the world. NORTHCOM plays a role in all of them, but this time, at this ceremony, I'd like to focus on the fifth challenge, the defeat of ISIL.  ISIL not only tyrannizes the populations where it arose in Iraq and Syria, but also attempts to spread its evil ideology elsewhere. It aspires to plot, or inspire attacks on Americans - including here at home. Our strategy for the lasting defeat of ISIL, therefore, is built around and will surely accomplish three objectives. One, destroying ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria. And I say lasting defeat of ISIL, because when ISIL is defeated - and it will be - it must stay defeated. This fact requires that we strengthen and enable with the vast power of the United States military and the international coalition arrayed with it, capable local forces, who can seize, hold and govern territory ISIL seized when it arose. The Coalition is providing strong support for Iraqi Security Forces, under the control of Prime Minister Abadi, who have retaken the cities of Ramadi and Hit, and are making steady advances up the Euphrates River Valley.  In Northern Iraq, we're also supporting and enabling Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces as they begin operations to envelop Mosul, one of ISIL's two main power centers. Meanwhile, in Syria, capable and motivated local forces there, supported by the Coalition, have retaken Tishrin Dam in the west and the town of Shaddadi in the east. In doing so, they've cut two significant lines of communication into ISIL's stronghold of Raqqa, and cut the main link from the city to ISIL's power center in Iraq, Mosul. We're also pressuring ISIL in both Iraq and Syria by systematically eliminating their so-called cabinet. We've taken out their ministers of war and finance, captured one of the architects of ISIL's chemical warfare enterprise. And most recently, we killed the ISIL's military Emir for Anbar Province.  At the same time, we're continuing attacks on ISIL's economic infrastructure - from oil wells and trucks, to cash storage sites - putting a stranglehold on ISIL's ability to pay its fighters, finance its operations and attract new recruits. In pursuit of ISIL's lasting defeat in Iraq and Syria, we have a clear plan of operations, which depends on enabling capable, local forces to collapse ISIL's control, especially in their two centers of power, Mosul and Raqqa.  Our accelerated campaign continues to gather strength as we support these local forces and find additional opportunities to hit ISIL in new ways. We're also addressing ISIL's metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, which is our second campaign objective. In Afghanistan, with new authorities and an added focus, we've been able to significantly degrade the group there. In Libya, we've undertaken successful strikes against a training camp and taken out ISIL's key leader of that country.  Whether in the Middle East, West Africa or south or southeast Asia or here in the homeland, we will counter ISIL and work with partners wherever ISIL has or tries to gain a foothold. Now, achieving these first two objectives against ISIL is necessary, but it's not sufficient. We must at the same time protect the homeland. While there's no credible imminent threat, ISIL has made its intent clear, that they seek to plot or incite attacks in this country. Every day, our homeland security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies are aggressively and skillfully working to prevent that from happening.  And I want to commend FBI Director Jim Comey, Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and CIA Director John Brennan and others for all they're doing and for their impressive results. Protecting the homeland requires vision and collaboration across these Departments and agencies, and to get to the point of this ceremony, DOD plays a vital supporting role. That's especially true at NORTHCOM, a Command which was established to support homeland defense in the aftermath of September 11. DOD supports whole of government efforts to protect the homeland in three critical ways. First, we're disrupting ISIL's operations and ability to conduct external attacks from abroad. Next, we're disrupting the flow of foreign fighters both to and from Iraq and Syria. And next, we're investing resources to provide greater force projection to our troops here at home. To take the first one, DOD is pursuing a systematic effort to disrupt ISIL's external operations by removing terrorists from the battlefield who are planning, directing or inspiring attacks against Americans. Just two weeks ago in Mosul, we killed Neil Prakash, the last remaining member of an ISIL cell calling for lone wolf attacks in this country. One week earlier in Syria, we also killed two more of ISIL's prominent facilitators of external attacks and recruiters of foreign fighters. Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani and his wife, Shadi Jabar Khalil Mohammed, both killed. Last year in Syria, we killed Junaid Hussain, a central figure in recruiting ISIS sympathizers to carry out lone wolf attacks in the West. It was also Hussain who was responsible for releasing personally identifiable information of more than 1,000 U.S. military and government employees and who sought to inspire want-to-be jihadists to conduct attacks against us in DOD. I am in no doubt and no one should have any doubt: those who threaten or incite harm against Americans will surely come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice. We will take decisive action against any ISIL member or leader planning to attack our country or encouraging others to do the same. We undertake these operations kinetically, but also through our expanding Cyber Mission Force. While I can't discuss many of these efforts publicly, I can say that DOD cyber capabilities are being employed in Iraq and Syria to prevent the ISIL threat from this region homeland. We're using these tools to deny the ability of ISIL leadership to command and finance their forces and control their populations, to identify and locate ISIL cyber actors and undermine the ability of ISIL recruiters to inspire or direct Homegrown Violent Extremists. We're also working to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters into and out of ISIL-controlled territory. Specifically, DOD is sharing what it collects from the battlefield with other domestic departments that are the leads for screening and watch-listing. For instance, when we collect fingerprints from an IED in Iraq or Syria, or personal information removed from terrorists, we include this information in our biometrics-enabled watch list, which is then shared with the relevant agencies across our government. We're also fusing and sharing information and expertise across the international coalition to stem foreign fighter flows and help prevent attacks. When I met with several Coalition-counterparts last week in Germany, including my colleague from Canada, I reviewed ongoing operations to support local forces working to close the Manbij area of Syria to ISIL, which is a critical transit point for terrorists planning to execute attacks outside Iraq and Syria. Together, we must close this last entry-exit area for foreign fighters into Europe and beyond once and for all. Next, we're providing greater force protection for our troops and DOD civilians here at home. As we learned from the tragedy in Chattanooga last summer, ISIL has demonstrated a clear intent to target U.S. servicemembers and facilities, or at least inspire others to do so. Providing greater force protection for men and women serving today is one way we honor those servicemembers who lost their lives last August. As part of our response to those events, we're stepping up protection at bases and at the thousands of off-base installations we operate, a mission which is under NORTHCOM's authority. We're putting in place stronger physical security systems, including stronger entry controls, better alarm systems, reinforced doors, and additional ways to safely exit our facilities. We're also introducing a mass warning and notification capability to broadcast threats quickly and broadly, notifying DOD personnel within a 20-mile radius of a threat within minutes. That's a direct response to Chattanooga, where the killer targeted two facilities 11 miles apart within the span of 12 minutes. Overall, we're investing an additional $80 million in force protection this year and an additional $100 million more over the next two years. At DOD, we're absolutely committed to strengthening and defending our people and facilities from potential threats of all kinds. Part of our responsibility as a military is also to keep some of the gravest threats to our people and nation at the front of our minds. While we have seen no credible evidence of a WMD threat against the homeland by any extremist group, ISIL's use of chemical weapons in Iraq underscores the importance of constant monitoring of potential threats even remote ones. This work also connects directly to another important part of NORTHCOM's mission, which involves providing support for partners across our government, including the FBI, to prepare for extreme threats and disasters. In cases where the interests of the United States would be seriously threatened, the department maintains a unique readiness to provide capabilities such as airlift, communications, and logistics support to federal, state, and local law enforcement. Just this month, DOD participated in a planned training exercise, NORTHCOM's VITAL ARCHER, working with the FBI as well as other domestic agencies to enhance our preparation and integration in responding to an incident involving WMD in the homeland. The Department also stands ready to respond to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks and disasters everywhere. The DOD chemical, radiological and nuclear response enterprise is comprised of National Guard and active duty forces, including 8,200 men and women under the command and control of NORTHCOM.  We will continue to train, plan and prepare for extreme circumstances when state response capabilities are exceeded and the lead federal agency requests and requires our support. As we pursue a whole of nation, whole of government effort to protect the homeland, you, the men and women of NORTHCOM, are providing steadfast support to the Department of Homeland Security and FBI. The American people and your families, our families, can sleep soundly knowing that you and your colleagues across our government are awake to defend and protect them. Keeping our people and nation safe and delivering ISIL a lasting defeat also depends on how effectively we work with our coalition partners. Of course, here at NORAD, our only by bi-national command, this issue comes naturally to many of you. Whether in defeating ISIL or in defending our nation against other threats that reach across borders, our alliance with Canada is indispensable. The United States and Canada are working together every hour of every day to provide a more prosperous and secure future for the citizens of both our nations. I also want to thank our Mexican partners for their determination to expand our continental defense partnership. Mexico has become a global exporter of security, both on this continent and beyond. I want to applaud Mexico for their growing defense relationship and also for continuing to ensure that common values and respect for human rights are the foundation of security efforts across the hemisphere and around the world. Now, let me turn to the change of leadership for the Command that performs so much of the work I've been speaking about, change from one gifted Commander to another. This Commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, Admiral Bill Gortney, has been instrumental in forging stronger coordination and deeper connections with both our Mexican and our Canadian neighbors. For Bill Gortney, serving and defending this nation has been the cause of his life for the better part of four decades.  With his father, who was also a Naval officer and aviator, this is a commitment that runs deep in his veins. Still, Bill has said that growing up, he never intended to follow in the footsteps of his father. That all changed the first time he stepped on an aircraft carrier and heard a powerful call to serve, and because Bill Gortney has followed that call with passion and commitment ever since, our Navy is stronger, our nation's more secure. During his service as a Naval Aviator, he logged more than 5,000 piloting A-7s and F/A-18 Hornets. He made more than 1,200 carrier landings and flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. And after accumulating a tremendous record of success as a pilot, he transitioned seamlessly to become one of the Navy's most successful sailor-statesmen. With his work to bring a diverse collection of nations together to respond to piracy in the Indian Ocean, just to take one example, he leaves a lasting legacy.  By breaking down silos between the services and between partner navies, which included the Russians and the Chinese, Bill was at the center of building a formidable coalition. When he began this work, piracy off the Horn of Africa was not only a growing scourge, it was a weight on the global economy and a threat to the rules-based international order. Today, the number of large cargo and container ships seized by pirates in the region can be counted on one hand. Across continents and assignments, Bill and his wife Sherry have been a formidable team, building inclusive and welcoming communities wherever they have served. During two assignments in Bahrain, Bill and Sherry were critical in helping families cope with an impending separation when dependents were order to return home. When the order was lifted, and families returned, Bill and Sherry's hospitality were instrumental in rebuilding a strong sense of community there. Several years ago, when Bill delivered the commencement address at his alma mater, Elon College, he spoke about what he had recently read on a plaque near the Statue of Liberty. They were the lines of another warrior statesman, an advocate for peace and freedom in the Americas, Jose Marti. The inscription read, and I quote, ""Liberty costs a great price, and one must either resign oneself to live without it or decide to pay its price."" Admiral Gortney, you have long understood that the price of liberty is great. And over the course of your accomplished career, you've borne it with great skill and strength. On behalf of the department, you and Sherry have our deepest appreciation for your selfless service to our nation. Thank you, Bill. And Bill, as you transition from this command, you can take comfort in knowing that NORAD and NORTHCOM are now in the hands of another proven strategic leader and warrior-diplomat, General Lori Robinson. I recommended General Robinson to the president because she has a remarkable and complete set of proven experience: her strength as a strategic thinker and manager, which I saw first-hand during her time in the Pentagon when I worked with her closely; her political and military experience, most recently - and this is very important - in the critical Asia-Pacific region; and her ability to lead and command in high-tempo operational environments, while putting her people first in every assignment. As a strategic thinker and joint force leader, General Robinson has proven her ability to manage complex operations and work with partners across theaters and domains. These abilities will serve our nation well as NORAD and NORTHCOM continue their vital contributions to the counter-ISIL campaign and defense of the homeland. Now, General Robinson is an Air Force Weapons Officer, which means she has proven her mettle by passing through one of our military's most demanding crucibles. And though Lori passed through weapons school with flying colors, it was not only her individual success, but the shared determination she inspired among her teammates, they say, that left another lasting impression. This ability to lead and inspire is an attribute she has carried with her to command roles in some of the most difficult and complex environments. General Robinson's success as an air battle manager, a role that requires conceptualizing combat operations in a fluid, three-dimensional space, and making split-second life-or-death decisions, is another tribute to her strength as a leader.  In one of the most high-pressure and high-stakes environments in our entire military enterprise, Lori thrived. Part of her success as Air Battle Manager came from developing a deep knowledge of the different traditions and cultures among the different technical specialities within the Air Force. It was an experience where she learned to communicate up and down the chain of command and began to deepen her extensive political-military skills. In her most recent tour as PACAF Commander, she demonstrated these capabilities over an area of responsibility covering nearly half the globe. She was instrumental in operationalizing our important rebalance to the Pacific, and in strengthening ties with air forces of some of our closest allies, including Japan, South Korea and Australia. And while there are many leaders who played a role in bringing the Indian Air Force back to Fed Flag, few were more instrumental than Lori Robinson. Lori's ability to lead, inspire and command respect across our joint force reflects her understanding that no matter what the complexity of our platforms or the power of our technology, it's always our people who come first. It's a value she shares with her husband, David, who's a former Thunderbird and a retired Major General in the Air Force Reserve. Lori and David are two leaders who appreciate personally the weight of all we ask our troops and their loved ones to carry. And for many families who experienced loss, their own strength and resilience have served as an inspiration. General Robinson has described her philosophy of leadership simply as this: leaders should be humble, approachable and credible to those entrusted to their command. Today, she brings that spirit to the solemn responsibilities of NORAD and NORTHCOM and to her leadership of men and women whose success is vital to the defense of our homeland. In the days to come, we cannot predict precisely how and when men and women of NORAD and NORTHCOM will be called forward to carry their mission, but we do know this. We know General Robinson will lead this team with certainty, clarity and with the full trust and confidence of me and the President. We know that as our military works with partners across our government and across our continent, NORAD and NORTHCOM's efforts will be essential in providing security for our people and our nation. And we know this with absolute certainty. The force General Robinson inherits is ready to execute its final responsibilities thanks to Admiral Gortney's leadership. To Admiral Gortney, to General Robinson, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership, thank you.

"June 4, 2016","Thank you, John.  Good morning, everyone.  I want to thank John, first of all, for inviting me to speak again this year, and IISS also for again bringing us together in this forum.  For 15 years now – and by the way I attended the first Dialogue– IISS has been fostering the discussions and debates that have shaped the dynamic Asia-Pacific’s security, stability, and prosperity in this still young century.  Thanks for doing so.  Thanks as well for the dinner last evening, which featured a thoughtful keynote by Thailand Prime Minister Prayut.  And I’d also like to thank our national host Singapore for welcoming us again this year.  To Prime Minister and others, thank you.  President Obama looks forward to hosting the Prime Minister in Washington in August.  This nation where we are right now – and its incredible rise – is the quintessential example of the remarkable progress in this region over the past 70 years.  Miracle after miracle has occurred here…Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Southeast Asia rose and prospered, and now, China and India and others are rising and prospering.  And continued progress is being made daily – by young innovators in Hanoi, and at technology companies in Mumbai; by the transition in Burma, and by avid consumers in China; the universities in Seoul, and in the bustling Strait of Malacca that I flew over yesterday.  There are many who share the credit for this success.  This region’s proud, industrious citizens first and foremost.  The statesmen in this region’s past, including the late Lee Kuan Yew, whom we continue to honor, and the many statesmen among you today.  The policymakers, business leaders, military officials, scholars, and non-governmental leaders who’ve worked to make this region stable and prosperous.  And, in addition to all these individuals, it’s also to the credit of shared principles – principles that have long been accepted and collectively upheld.  All that progress has led to historic change in the Asia-Pacific.  Most of the change has been positive: country after country is seeking to play a greater role in regional affairs, and that’s for the good.  But not all change in the region has been as constructive.  Indeed, tensions in the South China Sea, North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations, and the dangers of violent extremism felt worldwide, pose challenges to the region’s stability and prosperity.  And so as the region continues to change, forward-thinking statesmen and leaders must once again come together to ensure a positive and principled future…one where everybody, and every nation, continues to have the opportunity and freedom to rise, to prosper, and to win.  Thankfully, this room is full of such statesmen and leaders, and so is this region.  And I want to talk with you all about how we can come together:  how we can continue to build a principled security network that will allow additional waves of miracles and human progress and ensure regional stability and prosperity for years to come.  You may recall that at the end of my remarks last year, I projected conversations we might have at a future Shangri-La Dialogue.  If we continue to cooperate on security, I posited, we would one day be discussing a U.S.-China-India multilateral maritime exercise, a Japan-Republic of Korea joint disaster response in the South China Sea, and an ASEAN-wide security network.  Over the last year, we’ve made progress toward that vision.  China and India will both participate once again in the U.S.-hosted RIMPAC naval exercise this summer.  Japan and the Republic of Korea are engaging with each other in new ways.  And, through and in addition to the ASEAN-centric security network that’s developing in Southeast Asia, nations across the entire Asia-Pacific are increasingly working together – and networking security together.  By doing so, our nations are making a choice for a principled and inclusive future, one as bright and miraculous as the recent past.  A future where every country – no matter how big or small – is free to make its own political, economic, and military choices, free from coercion and intimidation.  Where disputes are resolved peacefully; and the freedoms of navigation and overflight, guaranteed by international law, are respected.  And where, as a result, every person and every nation has the opportunity to rise and prosper and win.  We all have an interest in realizing that future.  And a responsibility to bring it about.  Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure comparable to NATO in Europe.  That’s made sense for this region, with its unique history, geography, and politics, and where bilateral relationships have long served as the bedrock of regional security.  And yet, as the region continues to change, and becomes more interconnected politically and economically, the region’s militaries are also coming together in new ways.  They’re building connections for a common purpose: upholding the security and stability critical to a principled and prosperous future. And these connections are now helping our countries plan together, exercise and train together, and operate together, more effectively and efficiently than ever before.  Now, this growing Asia-Pacific security network includes but is more than some extension of existing alliances.  It weaves everyone’s relationships together – bilateral, trilateral, and multilateral – to help all of us do more, over greater distances, with greater economy of effort.  It enables us to take coordinated action to respond to contingencies like humanitarian crises and disasters; to meet common challenges, such as terrorism; and to ensure the security of and equal access to the global and regional commons, including vital waterways. You can see this networked approach in our collective responses to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and the Nepal earthquake last year.  Most importantly, this is a principled security network.  It is inclusive, since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute.  Everyone gets a voice, and no one is excluded, and hopefully, no one excludes themselves.  And as this security network reflects the principles our countries have collectively promoted and upheld for decades, it will help us realize the principled future that many in the region have chosen, and are working together toward.  By expanding the reach of all and by responsibly sharing the security burden, this principled network represents the next wave in Asia-Pacific security.  And the United States is fully committed to this principled security network and to the Asia-Pacific’s principled future.  That’s because this region, which is home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half of the global economy, remains the most consequential for America’s own security and prosperity. So even as the United States counters Russian aggression and coercion in Europe; as well as checks Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Middle East; and also accelerates ISIL’s certain defeat, America’s approach to the Asia-Pacific remains one of commitment, and strength, and inclusion.  Last Friday, I spoke with the newest class of American Navy and Marine Corps officers as they graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy.  These are some of the finest young men and women America has to offer.  And I explained to them that the United States has long and enduring diplomatic, economic, and security interests in the Asia-Pacific.  And their role in it.  As a result, the United States has for decades contributed to the region’s diplomatic, economic, and security affairs, including during the many other times when some wrongly predicted an impending American withdrawal from the Asia-Pacific.  In fact, decade after decade – in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s – we’ve heard that the United States would cede its role as the primary security provider in the Asia-Pacific.  And indeed, decade after decade – day in, and day out – American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines have worked here, most often with your nations, to help ensure this region’s security and uphold a common set of principles for all our countries to follow…so that every nation and everyone in this region could rise and prosper.  That’s been America’s objective and America’s practice for decades.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has remained economically, politically, and militarily engaged, as well as of course geographically located, in the Asia-Pacific.  And as I told those new officers, they will be doing the same in the years ahead and over the course of their long careers.  That’s because U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific is in America’s interests.  And the Congressional representation here today – including Chairman McCain, Senators Barrasso, Cotton, Ernst, Gardner, Graham, and Sullivan – demonstrates that America’s commitment to the region – and the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific in particular – is not transient.  It is enduring.  And that’s because the logic of, and the need for, and the value of American engagement in the Asia-Pacific is irrefutable.  And it is proven over decades.  President Obama launched the rebalance to ensure the United States continued to approach this changing region with commitment, strength, and inclusion.  Indeed, the rebalance is an affirmative investment in – and a U.S. Government-wide commitment to – the Asia-Pacific’s principled future.  Through the rebalance, the United States has reenergized our diplomacy in the region.  Just look at the recent months.  The President hosted the first-ever U.S. ASEAN Summit at Sunnylands.  President Obama made historic visits to Vietnam and Japan just last week, his tenth trip to the region.  I’m now on my fifth trip to the region – and it won’t be my last.  And my colleague and friend John Brennan, our CIA Director, is also attending the Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend.  Several of my Cabinet colleagues meanwhile will attend next week’s U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.  Prime Minister Modi will be in Washington next week, and Prime Minister Lee, as I said, will visit the next month.  In other words, this is a busy month in a busy year but one that is representative of America’s increased attention and engagement in the region.  The United States is also strengthening economic ties with the region.  For example, over the last seven years, U.S.-ASEAN trade has expanded by 55 percent.  Since last year’s Shangri-La Dialogue, we’ve completed negotiations on the important Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, or TPP, which will bind the United States more closely together with 11 other economies, unlock economic opportunities for all of us, and guarantee a trade system of high standard.  And the Defense Department for our part is operationalizing its part of the rebalance, too – cementing it for the future.  That means the United States will remain, for decades, the primary provider of regional security and a leading contributor to the region’s principled security network.  To do so, the Defense Department is continuing to send its best people – including some of those new Naval officers and Marines I spoke with last week – and also its most advanced capabilities to the Asia-Pacific.  That includes F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, continuous deployments of B-2 and B-52 bombers, and our newest surface warfare ships.  The Defense Department is also investing in new capabilities critical to the rebalance.  We’re growing the number of surface ships and making each of them more capable, and we’re investing in Virginia-class submarines, new undersea drones, the new B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as in areas like cyber, and electronic warfare, and space.  The Defense Department maintains its world-leading capabilities because the United States has made incomparable investments in it over decades.  As a result, it will take decades or more for anyone to build the kind of military capability the United States possesses.  This strength is not simply about dollar figures.  We harness those dollars to America’s innovative and technological culture to develop revolutionary technologies.  And that military edge is strengthened and honed in unrivaled and hard-earned operational experience over the past 15 years.  No other military possesses this kind of skill and agility backed by this much experience.  The Defense Department is also developing innovative strategies, operational concepts.  And the U.S. military is practicing these new ideas in training exercises, both on our own and with partners, none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC, which will bring together 27 countries for an opportunity to network.  As RIMPAC demonstrates, America’s defense relationships with allies and partners are the foundation of U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific, and those relationships are expanding, modernizing.  While it would take me too long to go through every valuable partnership, you can see the breadth and depth of our bilateral efforts with some of the actions the United States and its allies and partners have taken just since last year’s Shangri-La Dialogue.  For example, the U.S.-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone of Asia-Pacific security.  And with the new Defense Guidelines that Minister Nakatani and I signed last year, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger, or more capable of contributing to security around the region and beyond.  Similarly, the U.S.-Australia alliance is, more and more, a global one.  As our two nations work together to uphold the freedom of navigation and overflight across this region, we’re also accelerating the defeat of ISIL together in Iraq and Syria.  America’s alliance with the Philippines is as close as it has been in decades.  Through the new, landmark Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, the United States is supporting the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.  EDCA provides the opportunity for American and Filipino military personnel to regularly train, exercise, and operate together, including through new joint maritime patrols.  Another developing partnership, the U.S.-India military relationship, is as close as it’s ever been.  Through our strategic handshake – with the United States reaching west in its rebalance, and India reaching east in Prime Minister Modi’s Act East policy – our two nations are exercising together by air, land, and sea.  And there’s also a technological handshake: we’re moving toward deeper and more diverse defense co-development and co-production, including on aircraft carrier design and construction.  Minister Parrikar and I will identify new ways to cooperate in advance of Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Washington next week.  Meanwhile, President Obama’s historic visit to Hanoi last week was the latest demonstration of the dramatically-strengthened U.S.-Vietnam partnership.  Thanks in part to the leadership of Senator McCain, who is present here today, the United States has lifted the ban on lethal weapons sales to Vietnam.  Now Vietnam will have greater access to the military equipment it needs.  Finally, the U.S.-Singapore relationship continues to grow.  Just yesterday, I flew over the Strait of Malacca with my counterpart Minister Ng in one of the American P-8 surveillance aircraft that’s now part of a rotational deployment here.  That rotation is one of the many examples, including Singapore’s hosting four American littoral combat ships, of how our two countries are working together to build cooperation, provide security, and respond to crises in Southeast Asia.  And it’s reflective of a growing trend.  Indeed, even as the United States will remain the most powerful military and main underwriter of security in the region for decades to come – and there should be no doubt about that – those growing bilateral relationships demonstrate that nations around the region are also committed to doing more to promote continued regional security and prosperity.  That’s why the Asia-Pacific’s principled security network is growing. And as the region changes and the rebalance is solidified, the United States is and will continue using its unique capabilities, experience, and influence to enhance the region’s security network  – always contributing with commitment, strength, and inclusion.  For example, we’re moving out on the Maritime Security Initiative I announced at this Dialogue last year.  This initiative represents a $425-million-dollar, five-year, American commitment to multilateral security cooperation that aims to establish a maritime security network in Southeast Asia.  In the Initiative’s first year, the United States is helping the Philippines enhance its National Coast Watch Center and improving reconnaissance and maritime sensors; helping Vietnam train to develop future unmanned maritime capabilities; providing Indonesia and Malaysia with communications equipment and training; and working with Thailand on processing information at fusion centers.  More than simply providing money or hardware, the United States is helping these five countries connect with each other and develop a networked approach to regional challenges.  Those capabilities, those connections, and that U.S. partnership will allow these countries to see more, share more, and do more to ensure maritime security throughout Southeast Asia.  This initiative demonstrates the promise of a principled security network – nations building connections for a common cause, planning and training together, and eventually operating in a coordinated way.  Throughout the Asia-Pacific, more and more nations are similarly coming together in three key ways.  First, some pioneering trilateral mechanisms are bringing together like-minded allies and partners to maximize individual contributions and connect nations that previously worked together only bilaterally.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral partnership helps us coordinate responses to North Korean provocations.  And I’m pleased to announce that the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea will conduct a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise later this month.  And two other trilateral relationships – U.S.-Japan-Australia and U.S.-Japan-India – are also growing thanks, in part to exercises. We’ve agreed to hold, and begun planning on, additional U.S.-Japan-Australia trilateral exercises.  And through joint activities like this year’s MALABAR Exercise, the U.S.-Japan-India trilateral relationship is starting to provide real, practical security cooperation that spans the entire region from the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific.  We’re also seeing trilateral cooperation around other initiatives.  For example, the United States and Thailand included Laos in a successful bilateral program, and now our three nations are training together on explosive ordnance disposal.  Second – and moving beyond trilateral relationships involving the United States – many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own:  strengthening and developing bilateral relationships, and also creating trilateral arrangements.  Japan and Vietnam, for example, are collaborating on new joint maritime exercises.  Japan is also working to build the capacity of the Philippine maritime forces.  And India is increasing its training with Vietnam’s military and coast guard on their common platforms.  The Japan-Australia-India trilateral meeting last June was a welcome development and addition to the region’s security network.  And Indonesia has proposed trilateral joint maritime patrols with Malaysia and the Philippines, including counter-piracy patrols in the Sulu Sea.  The United States welcomes and encourages…encourages these burgeoning partnerships among like-minded partners who share our vision of a principled regional order.  Third and even more broadly, all of our nations are creating a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – through the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus.  At Sunnylands in February, ASEAN demonstrated again why it is a model for the principled future we all want for the Asia-Pacific.  In the summit declaration, the region committed to maintaining peace, security, and stability and to upholding shared principles in the region, including the freedom of navigation and overflight.  ADMM-Plus fills the growing need for an action-oriented, ASEAN-centric regional institution that builds trust, facilitates practical multilateral security cooperation, and brings the region together to meet these commitments. I want to thank Laos for its leadership of ADMM-Plus this year.  And I’m pleased to announce that in September, the United States and Laos will co-host an informal defense ministers’ dialogue in Hawaii, with all of the ASEAN countries, to follow-up on Sunnylands commitments, discuss common interests, and find new ways to network regional security.  As we weave these bilateral, trilateral, and multilateral relationships together, it’s important to remember that this principled network is not aimed at any particular country: it is open and excludes no one.  This means that as nations want to contribute to regional stability and security, they can work together with other nations in the network to do so.  The United States welcomes the emergence of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous China that plays a responsible role in the region’s principled security network.  We know China’s inclusion makes for a stronger network and a more stable, secure, and prosperous region.  In all of our interactions with our Chinese counterparts, the United States consistently encourages China to take actions that uphold – and do not undercut – the shared principles that have served so many in Asia-Pacific so well.  The region will be stronger, safer, and more prosperous when all countries are working toward a common vision in which shared principles are upheld, all countries enjoy equal treatment irrespective of their size or strength, and disputes are resolved peacefully and lawfully.  Unfortunately, there is growing anxiety in this region, and in this room, about China’s activities on the seas, in cyberspace, and in the region’s airspace.  Indeed, in the South China Sea, China has taken some expansive and unprecedented actions that have generated concerns about China’s strategic intentions. And countries across the region have been taking action and voicing concerns publicly and privately, at the highest levels, in regional meetings, and global fora.  As a result, China’s actions in the South China Sea are isolating it, at a time when the entire region is coming together and networking.  Unfortunately, if these actions continue, China could end up erecting a Great Wall of self-isolation.  Now, the United States is not a claimant in the current disputes in the South China Sea.  And we do not take a position on which claimant has the superior sovereignty claim over the disputed land features.  But, the United States will stand with regional partners to uphold core principles, like freedom of navigation and overflight, and the peaceful resolution of disputes through legal means and in accordance with international law.  As I affirmed here last year and America’s Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea have demonstrated, the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, so that everyone in the region can do the same.  And the United States will work with all Asia-Pacific nations to ensure these core principles apply just as equally in the vital South China Sea as they do everywhere else.  Because only when everyone plays by the same rules can we avoid the mistakes of the past, like when countries challenged one another in contests of strength and will, with disastrous consequences for the region.  The United States views the upcoming ruling by the UN Arbitral Tribunal on the South China Sea as an opportunity for China and the rest of the region to recommit to a principled future, to renewed diplomacy, and to lowering tensions, rather than raising them.  All of us should come together to ensure that this opportunity is realized.  The United States remains committed to working with China to ensure a principled future.  Our two countries have a long-standing military-to-military relationship.  We recently completed two confidence-building measures, one on maritime rules of behavior and another on crisis communications.  The regular U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks were just held in Hawaii.  And China will also be back at RIMPAC this year.  In fact, the United States and China plan to sail together from Guam to Hawaii for RIMPAC, conducting several exercise events along the way, including an event to practice search-and-rescue.  And the United States wants to strengthen those ties.  I plan, at President Xi’s invitation, to discuss this deeper cooperation as well as the concerns I’ve outlined here, when I travel to Beijing later this year.  America wants to expand military-to-military agreements with China to focus not only on risk reduction, but also on practical cooperation.  Our two militaries can all also work together, bilaterally or as part of the principled security network, to meet a number of challenges – like terrorism and piracy – in the Asia-Pacific and around the world.  After all, both our nations share so many interests.  And we face many of the same global challenges.  The United States expects and welcomes a China that plays a responsible role in world affairs commensurate with its wealth and potential influence.  Together in a network represented by all the delegates in this room, we all can do so much.  And the United States wants to work with China to find solutions for the global problems we’re both facing and seize the many opportunities before us.  By networking security together, the United States, China, and all others in the region can continue to ensure stability and prosperity in a dynamic region.  We can become more interconnected; we can develop greater interoperability; we can innovate together on shared capabilities.  And we can continue to ensure that this region’s historic change becomes historic progress…giving everyone and every nation in the Asia-Pacific the opportunity to rise and prosper and win.  Through a principled security network, we can all meet the challenges we’re facing together – whether it’s Russia’s worrying actions, North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations, the threat posed by extremists groups, or the growing strategic impact of climate change.  These challenges and others are real for all of us who live in the Asia-Pacific.  But so are the opportunities: for nations, for militaries, and for the people of the Asia-Pacific.  Across the region, there are economic miracles still to occur, military relationships still to strengthen, and populations still to educate, empower, and enrich.  To realize these opportunities, the Asia-Pacific will need continued stability and security.  It is said of this region, that security is like oxygen.  When you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  But when you don’t have enough, you can think of nothing else.  For many years, the United States – along with its allies and partners – helped provide oxygen in this it.  But by networking regional security together, we can all contribute more, and in different ways.  In the years ahead, as we continue to realize this brighter, principled future, providing the region’s oxygen will more and more become a networked effort.  Through the region’s principled security network, all of us will provide that oxygen – Americans and Filipinos, Chinese and Indians, Singaporeans and Japanese, Australians and Malaysians, Koreans and Kiwis, and many, many more.  Together, we will provide the security that enables millions upon millions of people all around the Asia-Pacific to continue to rise and prosper, to be safe, to raise their children, dream their dreams, and live lives that are full.  At a time of great change in this region, and in many of our home countries, all of us must defend the security, stability, and principles that have meant so much to the Asia-Pacific.  To do so, we may change how we network, how we plan, and how we operate.  But we can never change why we’re networking, and what we’re networking for:  for our security and shared interests…for the principles that have benefited so many for so long…and for that principled future where everyone can continue to rise and prosper.  That is the future many of us in this room spend our days working toward.  I thank you for that dedication.  But we’re not finished yet.  We have work still to do.  And I look forward to collaborating, and networking, with each of you – in the days, weeks, and years ahead – to realize this region’s principled future.  Thank you.

"May 9, 2016","Good morning, good morning.  Great to see you all, and I’m sorry we’re not outside but it was going to rain, but this is our auditorium, which I think doubles as a bomb shelter—I’m not really sure but… Twenty-five years ago this December, the flag of the Soviet Union – an emblem of nearly half a century of nuclear competition, confrontation, and crisis – was lowered for the last time at the Kremlin and elsewhere.  Today, we come together as a community to thank some of the forward-thinking statesmen and public servants who helped make that historic moment of change far less dangerous, and to learn lessons from their work as we work to shape another era of profound global change. Senators Nunn and Lugar, partner nation representatives, and Defense Department personnel, past and present – thank you for coming this morning.  I also want to acknowledge Secretary Perry who was unable to travel here today.  I know we all wish he was here. To appreciate the 25 years of CTR’s and its importance, we must go back in time to understand the danger that existed.  The then-Soviet Union possessed tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and enough enriched uranium and plutonium for tens of thousands of more.  It also had 40,000 tons of chemical weapons and a deadly stockpile of biological agents ready for use.  These weapons were spread across the vast Soviet empire and in Eastern Europe too.  And as the Soviet Union reformed, then faltered, and began to disintegrate, control of this vast arsenal was thrown into doubt. We were able to prevent that danger from becoming a threat; that’s clear now, but I can tell you that was far from clear then.  Why is that relevant for us in the Defense Department—you all, me, and the whole department--today?  We face similarly profound and seemingly insurmountable challenges today, and this history shows we can and we will overcome them.  These threats also require new thinking of the kind that CTR represents and new ways of operating, like I’m challenging our Department to show today. This was a brand new problem in those days, brand new to history. Really required new thought. It was, first of all, the first-ever disintegration of a nuclear power. And second, while people had considered accidental nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis and Dr. Strangelove movie, they tended to think of the weapons systems themselves in that context, and the vital technological problems of first-strike capabilities, mutually assured destruction, and the like. But few, few appreciated nuclear command-and-control, custody, surety, and that command-and-control was more than a technical system, it was a human, social system that could not be immune to the disintegration of a society in which it was embedded.  I myself worked on command and control in my first job here at the Pentagon, at the height of the Cold War, a decade before the Soviet Union disintegrated. And Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar understood this, also, deeply from their work with Soviet Leaders on arms control over the decades before, and Sam and Dick knew that deterrence alone would not protect us against destruction in the new situation.  This new form of nuclear danger required something new. Third, the very idea of the Nunn-Lugar program, which was to work with, and not against, the custodians of the former Soviet arsenal, also was novel.  After all, we had spent half a century bringing the Soviet Union to its knees…to help them, even fund them, to control the vast nuclear legacy of the USSR, seemed paradoxical to many, and it was controversial. Here’s what happened next, as I remember it so clearly. Sam and Dick saw impending chaos up close when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev briefly suffered a coup and was placed under house arrest in Crimea.  They began to assemble experts to design an approach to this new problem.  And I was among them, at the time collaborating from Harvard with a Stanford faculty member named Bill Perry.  We were funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and you’ll see the significance of that further in a moment.  Now Sam and Dick—there’s one story I’ll tell—asked me one morning to brief the Senate leadership on the program plan, which I did.  So, being young and new to this, I stood up and talked for a while, and after a while I said, “OK, that’s enough.” And I sat down and then I proceeded to observe what was to me a fascinating conversation among the senior senators.  Nobody noticed me and ushered me out for this conversation, and at the end of it, Sam came up to me and said, “Don’t ever tell anybody what you just saw.” So I won’t.  And I haven’t. But, anyway, the Nunn-Lugar amendment passed and was enacted into law.  Shortly thereafter Bill Perry became Deputy Secretary of Defense and then Secretary of Defense, and I, as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, was put in charge of making the program work. Now, let me tell you the role of our honorees today.  We brought on a number of people, whom we honor today, to handle different aspects of the program and they did it superbly and they made history: Gloria Duffy, my Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense—listen up, DASDs--was then in charge of negotiating agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan and coordinating overall the program.  She’s now President of the prestigious Commonwealth Club of California. Susan Koch was DASD in charge of coordinating the Nunn-Lugar program with our global arms control efforts.  She’s now a Distinguished Research Fellow at the National Defense University’s Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Liz Sherwood-Randall was a DASD in charge of overall defense relationships with Former Soviet States, all 15 of them.  She is now Deputy Secretary of Energy and couldn’t be with us today. And Laura Holgate.  Laura was my assistant at Harvard…she was responsible for managing the study effort that made our contribution to Nunn-Lugar.  And she flew the analysis I used at that Senate breakfast down the night before on what used to be the old shuttle at National Airport.  Laura later was Gloria’s successor as DASD for CTR.  She’s now a Special Assistant to the President and [Senior] Director of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Terrorism, and Threat Reduction at the National Security Council. Jane Wales.  Jane was Chair of the Cooperative Security Program at Carnegie Corporation in New York, which David Hamburg [was] President of ... who saw the importance of this problem and funded our work.  She was later a Senior Director on the National Security Council and Special Assistant to the President at the White House helping coordinate CTR work with interagency partners.  Now, she is the CEO of the Global Philanthropy Forum, the President and CEO of the World Affairs Council, and Vice President at the Aspen Institute. The achievements of Nunn-Lugar, Senator Nunn, Senator Lugar, our nominees today led to the denuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus..  It led to a safeguarding and destruction of fissile materials.  And it led to the destruction of nuclear weapons systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Together, with all that, the world came through a historic moment of change safely.  It certainly didn’t look likely or possible at that time.  It shows that visionary statesmanship by people like Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar – bipartisan, by the way – and superb execution by our honorees can do things that many think impossible. The CTR framework continues today.  And I salute members of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency – past and present, some here today, and others watching out at Fort Belvoir – who carry on the mission.  It’s evolved.  It’s extended its focus to terrorism, not just disintegrated states.  It has extended its work to chemical and biological weapons.  And it has gone global, far beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. Today, to mark CTR’s 25th Anniversary, we are dedicating what will now be called the Nunn-Lugar Conference Room in the SecDef corridor on the E-Ring, right across from my office.  That conference room, which we’ve all used, is henceforth the Nunn-Lugar Room.  That’s a space, as you all know, in the Pentagon, where we bring together to the Defense Department senior leaders, where President Obama has held National Security Council meetings, and where we meet with outside experts to discuss how our country and our military can meet the many challenges and opportunities we face in this strategic era. From this day on, anyone who enters the Nunn-Lugar room – presidents and policymakers, military and civilian officials, scholars and business leaders – will walk past a plaque that reminds them of the forward-thinking programs, the bipartisan cooperation, and the enduring legacy of Senators Nunn and Lugar. And their example will inspire today’s leaders, and tomorrow’s, to take novel, even paradoxical steps, to develop new ways of thinking and operating to continue to keep the nation safe and leave our children a better world. We are also presenting the first Nunn-Lugar Trailblazer Awards to some of the members of the first team that helped bring the CTR program to life: Gloria, Susan, Liz, Laura, and Jane.  I traveled the world with this team, and many others, as we worked to realize the Nunn-Lugar vision and make the world safer.  With this award, we’re recognizing each of their contributions to history.  And we’re holding them up as an example to which we can all, and all of you in the audience, aspire…as we continue our work here to safeguard and dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems worldwide, to protect our country, and to leave a better world Thank you.

"June 20, 2016","Just take a moment and behold what’s in front of us here.  Look at these magnificent, proud members of our Army.  And it’s them that we’re here about today, to give them the leadership they deserve. Secretary Fanning, it’s an honor to formally welcome you, and it’s also a pleasure to welcome Ben, your mother Kathy, your sister Erin, and your entire family. And General Milley, Mark, I appreciate the confidence I can have in you for your dedication to our soldiers throughout the world, to the future of the Army. To the members of the diplomatic community here today, thank you for honoring us with your presence. I’d also like to welcome the Senators and Members of Congress who’ve joined us, and all of the White House officials and members of our DoD family, past and present, who are here on this important day for our country and for our Army. It has been a privilege to work alongside Secretary Eric Fanning for many years, and watch him develop into one of our country’s most knowledgeable, dedicated, and experienced public servants.  I’ve seen firsthand why he’s one of this Administration’s most trusted and capable appointees and one of the Pentagon’s most dependable civilian leaders. Secretary Fanning served as my chief of staff when I first became Secretary of Defense.  I looked to him to help me recruit and attract a talented and innovative team of civilian and military leaders, many of whom are with us today.  And He’s served in senior leadership roles in each of our military departments, including time as Undersecretary of the Air Force, and Acting Secretary of the Air Force, as well as Deputy Under Secretary of the Navy, and that gives him a unique perspective on the pivotal connections that bind our joint force. From his service in positions of responsibility on non-proliferation issues and weapons of mass destruction, to his proven leadership in resource management, Secretary Fanning understands the full spectrum of responsibilities and opportunities that we face as a 21st century military. We have today no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving  challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe, managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and confronting terrorism, including accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and wherever else it metastasizes. And since we have a pretty good record of never successfully predicting the strategic future, we must also be flexible and agile in preparing for it -- for unknowns that we can’t anticipate today. Secretary Fanning and General Milley understand all this, understand what must be done to ensure the readiness and strength of the Army to confront the challenges of today’s security environment. They’re working together to strengthen the Army’s unparalleled ability, forged over the last 15 years, and much longer, to carry out its core mission, which is to seize, hold, and dominate physical and human terrain.  They aren’t resting on the current excellence of our Army; they’re doubling down on it, ensuring that our ground forces are agile, unrivaled in posture, ready for full spectrum operations, and always prepared to defend America’s interests and values. And they’ve never forgotten that the true strength of our force is in our people. That’s why, under the leadership of Secretary Fanning and General Milley, the Army is moving forward with several key initiatives we’ve introduced across the Department to build the Force of the Future.  These include supporting greater flexibility in the officer promotion system, and improvements in our family policies to help retain soldiers serving today – such as expanded maternity and paternity leave, and extended childcare hours on base, and also greater opportunities for our soldiers to gain outside experience in the private sector. These and many other changes in both our uniformed and civilian policies will help to ensure that amid changes in generations, changes in technologies, and changes in labor markets, we continue to bring in, develop, and retain the best young men and women that America has to offer for our all-volunteer Army. That’s also why we’ve opened all combat positions to women who can meet our standards, and Secretary Fanning and General Milley are doing an excellent job ensuring the successful implementation of this change and others to come – a key capability of an institution that has shown the best of tradition and competitive adaption over 241 years. At the Department of Defense, we are constantly looking for ways to innovate and think outside of our five sided box - innovating not only in our technology, but also in our operations, in our strategies, in how we manage our people.  Secretary Fanning and General Milley embody that spirit of innovation, and the kind of strong and steady leadership that will ensure our successors and our successor’s successors continue to inherit the finest fighting force the world has ever known. So it’s an honor to formally welcome Secretary Fanning as Secretary of the Army, and I want to thank him for everything he’s doing on behalf of all of the soldiers and military families who serve today, from the mountains of Afghanistan, to the plains of eastern Europe, to the Korean Peninsula, to enabling our partners on the ground in Iraq and Syria.  And as he works to protect those who protect our country, Secretary Fanning could not have a better partner than the man I am about to introduce. Ladies and gentlemen, another leader whose nomination was easy to recommend to the President, Army Chief of Staff, General Mark Milley.

"Sept. 18, 2015","Forty years ago – forty years ago – the son of a steelworker was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. Having come from the blue-collar town of Butler, Pennsylvania, he’d chosen to wear a blue collar of a different sort – that of a midshipman here at the United States Naval Academy. And when he graduated, the Academy’s yearbook predicted that, and I quote, “with his personality, good looks,” – really dubious – “receding hairline,” – low, low, low, still not gone – “and quick wit,” – and here’s the part that was definitely right – “he is bound to be a success.” As anyone who knows Jon Greenert would tell you, they were absolutely right. Today, we return to the same storied Academy, to thank that man for his career of service, to honor the naval forces he led, and to welcome aboard his relief – passing our Navy’s conn from one great leader to another. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, leaders of the Navy and the Defense Department past and present: good afternoon, thank you for joining us here today for this celebration of two of America’s great sailors – the 30th Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jon Greenert, and the soon-to-be 31st CNO, Admiral John Richardson. I’d like to recognize Admiral Greenert’s family here today. As Jon likes to say – and I know the feeling – he married up when he and Darleen began a life together over 30 years ago. Having served as a naval officer herself – I’m told they first met when they were stationed in Hawaii together – Darleen has always been deeply committed to our Navy, its sailors, and their families. And we’re deeply grateful to her for that. Together, Jon and Darleen raised a family that shares their commitment to service and our defense mission…their son Jonathan, their daughter Sarah, their son Brian, and Brian’s very young son Leland – where’d Leland go? This cute kid, who is the first Greenert grandchild – congratulations. They’re all here today. Thank you for supporting Jon. Some of you may recall, and I recall very vividly, I was present at the beginning of Jon’s tenure in this job, in this very place. And now that we’ve reached the end, I’m pleased to tell you that as CNO, he has been a tremendous leader for our Navy for the last four years…four years that have been critical for our military, for the country – marked by an ever-changing security environment and persistent budget turbulence, but also by magnificent performance by the Navy under his leadership. With Admiral Greenert standing the watch, America’s [sailors] and Marines have been where it matters, when it matters – rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific, where much of America’s future will be written; reinforcing our longstanding NATO allies; supporting our forces ashore in the turbulent Middle East; and providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the world over, in a way that only America can and does do. Indeed, from Fukushima to the Gulf, from the Black Sea to the Philippines, the Navy has lived its chief’s – this chief’s – three tenets: “warfighting first, operate forward, and be ready.” But beyond the present, beyond the present, Jon’s also made sure to focus on the future. This is important. Four years ago, he was among a small group in the Pentagon who began to recognize the advanced capability gap that could develop between the United States and our high-end potential opponents. Jon was one of the first people in the Pentagon to start working on that problem, and I worked on it with him. He understood what was happening early on, well before it became mainstream – and he’s been someone I’ve looked to in the years since. As CNO, recognizing DoD must invest in innovation to stay ahead of new threats, he emphasized payloads over platforms, and created the CNO’s Rapid Innovation Cell, empowering junior leaders to find and rapidly field emerging technologies and capabilities to solve some of the Navy’s most pressing challenges. Thanks to Jon’s leadership, this has already made a lasting impact, advancing breakthrough ideas from information dominance, to cyber defense, to putting 3D printers on ships that enable sailors to swiftly manufacture many things they might need while underway – training aids, models, medical devices, you name it – without having to wait for resupply. Of course, always on Admiral Greenert’s mind was the welfare of his sailors. You see it in how he puts them at ease, whether it’s out on deck during a ship visit or speaking at a hail-and-farewell – asking “hey, what’s your favorite sports team?” – Jon’s, of course, always the Steelers, which, I’m a Philadelphia boy, so I resent slightly, but that’s okay – before talking easily about this statistic or that statistic or that player he’s always admired on whatever team it was. You see it also in how he’s led the Navy’s personnel – enabling the service to innovate and be on the leading edge in how it manages its talent, so we can keep recruiting and retaining in the future, the kind of magnificent men and women who make today’s U.S. military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Jon, those men and women are going to miss you. I am going to miss you. We all are. Because, as you leave the Pentagon for safe harbor in your cottage off the shores of the Chesapeake – where I know you’ll enjoy spending time with that little grandson and also your dog, a golden retriever – you’ve also left America’s Navy well-positioned for success. We’re very grateful for that, because in the months and years ahead, America’s Navy will continue to be called upon. With global challenges that span every domain – not only the sea, but also the air, land, space, and cyberspace – the Navy is critical to our military’s ability to project power around the world, protect the global commons, and flow ready forces wherever they’re needed. Given the advanced systems being fielded by other nations today, this will include helping ensure our forces can access denied areas. Our Navy has long been a lynchpin of global security and prosperity, ensuring the free flow of commerce that has enabled many nations to rise and prosper. And that won’t change, as our sailors, naval aviators, and submariners continue to sail, fly, and operate wherever international law allows – from the Arctic to the South China Sea. Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and while we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them. This means that overall, the Navy’s strategic future will require focusing more on posture, not only on presence; and more on new capabilities, not only ship numbers. And the Navy is more than up to this task. Under Admiral Greenert’s leadership, the Navy has already begun investing in research, developing and acquiring what we need to stay ahead of emerging threats and to sustain our military’s technological superiority. This includes submarines, long-range anti-ship missiles, the electromagnetic railgun, numerous unmanned undersea, surface, and aerial vehicles – some autonomous, some teamed with human controllers and other manned systems – and a wide variety of payloads, from weapons to electronic warfare systems. Meanwhile, the Navy has also been developing innovative operational concepts to use existing capabilities in new and creative ways – like using flocks of swarming drones for several different missions, adapting our Tomahawk missiles to be used against moving targets in a maritime environment, and using smart projectiles that can be fired from a destroyer’s five-inch gun to defeat incoming missiles at much lower cost per round. Continuing and building on all this work will be critical going forward – and Admiral John Richardson was a clear choice to carry it out. Like Admiral Greenert, he’s exceptional, strong, quiet, and centered. He’s a bold and innovative thinker, a tremendous leader, and the go-to officer for many of the Navy’s tough issues in recent years. He’s been its best troubleshooter – from handling problems of integrity and ethics, to preparing for the Ohio-class replacement ballistic missile submarine, to leading the Navy’s advanced capability efforts…and we need to get all of that right in the years ahead. I know he’ll be the man to do it. He is, of course, in high demand – I had to wrestle him away from the Secretary of Energy – but as anyone who’s worked with John will tell you, he’s worth the fight. I told Ernie Moniz that if I could clone John Richardson, I would. And he could have one and I could have the other. But I couldn’t do that, so I was stealing him. Because he’ll do an excellent job of helping steer our Navy in the future. John too cares very deeply about the sailors he’ll soon lead. He learned that from his father, who’s here today – a retired Navy Captain, and a submariner like his son. Captain Richardson, thank you for your decades of service, and for raising such a fine officer. John draws strength from your legacy, and from his entire family – his wife Dana, whom we thank for her service and support of John, and also their five kids, also here today as well. There’s Nathan, who’s a Navy lieutenant, and also Daniel, Rachel, Veronica, and Matthew. To each of you, thank you, thank you for the love you’ve given your dad over the years. I’m sure raising you has kept your parents on their toes – it works like that – but I know it’s also prepared your dad to help me build the force of the future, where we’ll make sure we continue attracting new generations of talented Americans to contribute to our mission. So Jon, Darleen, “other” John, Dana, and both of your families: We thank you for your many years of service to our country. We look forward to your continued success. And we wish all of you the most favorable of winds, the safest of tides, and the calmest of seas in the years ahead. Thank you.

"Feb. 2, 2016"," Thanks, David.  Appreciate it.  And good morning, everyone.  Appreciate you being here.  It's a pleasure for me to be -- what I understand, David, to be the first secretary of defense to address the Economic Club of Washington. And one of the core tasks for me, and one of my core goals in this job has been to build and to rebuild bridges between our wonderful department, and the wonderful, innovative, strong American technology and industry community. So, I appreciate you returning the favor by giving me the opportunity to be here as, what is, of course, the largest institution with the largest budget in America. And it's that budget I'd like to discuss with you this morning.  A week from now, President Obama will release his administration's budget for fiscal year 2017.  About half of its discretionary portion -- that is, $582.7 billion, to be precise -- will be allocated for the Department of Defense. And today, I would like to preview with you some of the overarching themes, and some of the new investments that we will be making -- because the fact is, this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense. In this budget, we're taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today's fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come, 10, 20 or 30 years down the road. Last fall's budget deal set the size of our budget, allowing us to focus on the shape, making choices and trade-offs to adjust to a new, strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future. Let me describe the strategic thinking that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it's evident that America is still, today, the world's foremost leader, partner and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe -- as we have been since the end of World War II. And as we fulfill this enduring role, it's also evident that we're entering a new strategic era.  Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused, of necessity, on large scale counter insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full spectrum war fighting. While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it has also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL and the resurgence of Russia being just a couple of the examples. This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we've seen in history following the end of other major wars. Today's security environment is dramatically different than the one we've been engaged in for the last 25 years and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. I've talked with President Obama about this a great deal over the last year and as a result, we have five, in our minds, evolving challenges that have driven the focus of the Defense Department's planning and budgeting this year. Two of these challenges reflect a return to great power of competition.  First is in Europe, where we're taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression, and we haven't had to worry about this for 25 years; while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  Second is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising and where we're continuing and will continue our rebalance, so-called, to maintain the stability in the region that we have underwritten for 70 years and that's allowed so many nations to rise and prosper and win.  That's been our presence. Third challenge is North Korea – a hardy perennial – a threat to both us and to our allies, and that's why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready every single day, today, tomorrow, to, as we call it, fight tonight. Iran is the fourth challenge, because while the nuclear deal was a good deal and doesn't limit us in the Defense Department in any way – none of its provisions affect us or limit us – we still have to counter Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel. And challenge number five is our ongoing fight to defeat terrorism and especially ISIL, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also, where it is metastasizing in Afghanistan, Africa and elsewhere.  All the time, we protect -- all the while, we're protecting our homeland and our people. While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective we must also take into account in our budget that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller and more aberrant groups of people, countering terrorists will likely be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of defense and national security leaders far into the future as I can see. DOD must and will address all five of those challenges as part of its mission to defend our people and defend our country.  Doing so requires some new thinking on our part, new posture in some regions and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, as we confront these five challenges, we'll now have to deal with them across all domains, not just the usual air, land and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also lead to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit. Here, our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action or make them deeply regret it if they do. To be clear, the U.S. military will fight very differently in coming years than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan or in the rest of the world's recent memory. We will be prepared for a high-end enemy.  That's what we call full spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes, that if they start a war, we have the capability to win.  Because a force that can deter conflict must show that it can dominate a conflict. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors.  They have developed and are continuing to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  And in some case, they are developing weapons and ways of wars that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they hope, we can respond. Because of this and because of their actions to date, from Ukraine to the South China Sea, DOD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting.  While we do not desire conflict of any kind with either of these nations -- and let me be clear, though they pose similar defense challenges, they're otherwise very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they appear to choose to pursue. Let me now highlight some new investments we're making in this budget to address both the near-term challenges – I'll start with the near-term challenges and begin there with our campaign to deliver a lasting defeat to ISIL. As I said a couple of weeks ago at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and in Paris a week and a half ago, and as I'll reiterate when I meet with my coalition counterparts in Brussels next week, we must and we will defeat ISIL. Because we are accelerating the campaign, DOD is backing that up and we need to back it up in our budget with a total of $7.5 billion in 2017, 50 percent more than in 2016.  This will be critical as our updated coalition military campaign plan kicks in. For example, we've recently been hitting ISIL with so many GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets that we’re starting to run low on the ones that we use against terrorists the most.  So we're investing $1.8 billion in F.Y. '17, to buy over 45,000 more of them. We're also investing to maintain more of our 4th generation fighter and attack jets that we previously planned, including the 810, which has been devastating to ISIL from the air. The budget defers the A-10's final retirement until 2022, replacing it with F-35 Joint Strike Fighters on a squadron-by-squadron basis, so we'll always have enough aircraft for today's conflicts. Another near-term investment in the budget is how we are reinforcing our posture in Europe to support our NATO allies in the face of Russia's aggression – in Pentagon parlance, this is called the European Reassurance Initiative – and after requesting about $800 million for last year, this year we're more than quadrupling it for a total of $3.4 billion in 2017. That will fund a lot of things: more rotational U.S. forces in Europe, more training and exercising with our allies, more preposition and war-fighting gear and infrastructure improvements to support all this. And when combined with U.S. forces already in and assigned to Europe -- though also substantial -- all of this together by the end of 2017 will let us rapidly form a highly-capable combined arms ground force that can respond across that theater, if necessary. And as you can imagine, the budget also makes important investments in new technologies.  We have to do this to stay ahead of future threats in a changing world.  As other nations try to catch on the advantages that we have enjoyed for decades, in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber and space. Some of these investments are long-term, and I will get to them in a moment.  But to help maintain our advantages now, DOD has an office that we don't often talk about, but I want to highlight today.  It's called the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO for short. I created the SCO in 2012 when I was deputy secretary of defense to help us to re-imagine existing DOD and intelligence community and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential enemies -- the emphasis here was on rapidity of fielding, not 10 and 15-year programs.  Getting stuff in the field quickly. We need to make long-term investments as well.  I will get to them in a moment.  But the focus here was to keep up with the pace of the world. I picked a talented physicist -- also, by the way, a Rhodes Scholar.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but it also has the rare virtue of rapid development, and an rarer virtue of keeping current capabilities viable for as long as possible -- in other words, it tries to build on what we have.  Smart.  So, it's good for the troops, it's good for the taxpayers, too. Thinking differently in this way – as is well known in U.S. defense history – put us in space, our country on the moon, computers in the pockets, information at the fingertips -- all of that.  Taking airplanes off of the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, satellite networks that take pictures of the world -- all of those things. This kind of bold and innovative thinking can't be lost to history, it's happening now everyday, not only in SCO but in other places throughout the Department of Defense, like our dozens of laboratories and engineering centers, located all over the country. As we drive this work for the budget, grows our research and development accounts for the second year in a row, investing a total of $71.4 billion in R&D in 2017 -- a number that no other institution in the United States or the world comes close to. And to show the return we're getting on those investments, I'll tell you about a few projects in the SCO that it has been working on, and that are funded in this budget.  Some of them you may have heard of, but my guess is some of them you have not -- and I know that some of them, we're talking about for the very first time here. First is a project focused on advanced navigation.  What the SCO's doing is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras, sensors, MEMS [microelectromechanical systems], and so forth that are littered throughout our smartphones and everything today, and putting them on our small diameter bombs to augment the existing target capabilities on the SDB.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads, enabling off network targeting through commercial components, small enough to hold in your hand like your phone, and cheap enough to own like your phone. Another project uses swarming autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways and in multiple domains.  In the air, they develop micro-drones that are really fast, really resistant.  They can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they've developed self-driving boats which can network together to do all kinds of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance, without putting sailors at risk.  Each one of these leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the microdrones, I mentioned a moment ago, use a lot of commercial components and are actually 3-D printed and the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that long-ago and in a much more primitive form were on the Mars lander. They've also got a project on gun-based missile defense, where we're taking some of the same hypervelocity smart projectiles that we developed for the electromagnetic gun.  That's the railgun.  And using it for point defense.  By firing it with artillery, we already have in our inventory, including the five-inch guns on the front of every Navy destroyer and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  In this way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors or on new platforms, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at a much lower cost per round and thereby imposing higher costs on an attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin a little over a month ago, and we also found that it significantly increases the Paladin's range. And the last project I want to highlight is one that we're calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platform and turns it into a flying launchpad for all sorts of different conventional payloads. In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, network to fifth generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes, essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create holy new capabilities. So these are just a few examples of what the SCO has done so far and they're working a lot more. Now, there are many other areas where we're driving smart and essential technological innovation in the budget to stay ahead of future threats over the long-term and keep our military in the decades ahead the best in the world, the first with the most, bar none. One of these is undersea capabilities, where we continue to dominate and where the budget invests over $8.1 billion in 2017 and more than $40 billion over the next five years to give us the most lethal undersea and any submarine force in the world.  It buys more advanced maritime control aircraft.  And it not only buys nine of our most advanced Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; it also equips –more of them with the versatile Virginia Payload Module, which triples each submarine platform’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk missiles to 40. Now, budgets often require trade-offs, which all of you in your own domains are very familiar with.  So where trade-offs among force structure, modernization and readiness posture needed to be made we generally pushed to favor the latter two.  This is important, because our military has to have the agility and ability to win not only the wars that could happen today, but also the wars that could happen in the future. To put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and a lot of other important areas, one trade-off we made was to buy only as many Littoral Combat Ships as we really need.  This is part of a broader effort in our budget to focus the Navy on having greater lethality and capability that can turn deter and defeat even the most high-end future threats.  I'll be discussing this further tomorrow in San Diego when I visit some of our Navy surface warfare sailors. We're also investing more in cyber, totaling nearly $7 billion in 2017, and almost $35 billion over the next five years.  Among other things, this will help to further DOD's network defenses, which is critical; build more training ranges for our cyber warriors; and also develop cyber tools and infrastructure needed to provide offensive cyber options. I also want to mention space because at times in the past, space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that that's not the case anymore and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends in space.  Last year we added over $5 billion in new investments to make us better postured for that.  And then in 2017 we’re doing even more, enhancing our ability to identify, attribute and negate all threatening actions in space.  For so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet: free and safe for all. There are some in this world who don't want that to happen – who see America's dominance in these and other areas and want to take that away from us in the future so that we can't operate effectively around the globe.  So we’re not waiting to invest until the threats are fully realized.  We're investing now so we stay ahead of them. And of course, pioneering and dominating technological frontiers is just one way that our budget seizes its opportunities for the future.  We're also innovating operationally, making our contingency plans and operations more flexible and dynamic, from Europe to the Asia-Pacific.  And we're investing to build the force of the future, as I call it – the all-volunteer force of the future.  Because as good as our technology is, it is nothing compared to our people.  Our people are the reason we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And we have to ensure that the talent we recruit and retain generations from now, is just as good as the excellent people we have today. I made several announcements over the last few months to help to do that.  We're opening all remaining combat positions to women, very simply, so that we have access to 50 percent of our population for the all-volunteer force.  And every American who can meet our exacting standards – and that's important – will have the equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  We're also implementing several new initiatives to improve and modernize our personnel management systems to create what I call, on ramps and off ramps that allow more people inside and outside DOD to engage with and contribute to our mission. People outside the defense to come in for a while, maybe not for career for a few years and contribute to the most consequential mission that a human being can contribute to, and our own people to get out and learn about how the rest of the world works and make sure that their up to date and up to speed. I've emphasized this, both at Silicon Valley and at our Boston technology hub.  And we're strengthening the support we provide to our military families to improve their quality of life, the emphasis here being on retention of excellent people, and where we can, making it possible for them to reconcile the needs of -- having a family with our needs of military service. Not always possible to reconcile, but we're making an effort where we can, consistent with the profession of arms and our needs.  There will be more to come along this line. Now, having told you about the budget, and particularly talking to an audience like this, I need to say something also about how we're reforming the DOD enterprise to make us more efficient.  I can't come before a group like this and ask for the amount of money that I believe we need for our defense, unless I can also satisfy you that we're spending it in the best possible way. Just like you have your shareholders, we have our taxpayers, and we owe it to them to ensure that we're doing everything we can to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible. That's why, along with our budget, we are keeping us our focus on, for examples, acquisition reform.  We are already starting to see results from our better buying power initiatives, and we are looking to do more and get better.  We are also doing more to reduce overhead, which we expect to help nearly eight -- provide us more than $8 billion over the next five years – eight billion dollars that we can use elsewhere for real capability and not overhead.  And we're looking at reforms to the Goldwater-Nichols Act, the famous act of the 1980s, that defines much of DOD's institutional organization. On this last point, we've been doing a thorough review for the last several months, and I expect to begin receiving recommendations on that in coming weeks and making decisions. Let me close by touching on the broader shift that is reflected in this budget.  For a long time, DOD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts -- long-term at the expense of the here-and-now. Thankfully, we were able to realize that over the decade, correct it, and turn our attention to the fights we were in.  We had to do that. The difference is, while that kind of singular focus may have made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets, or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won't work for the world we live in today.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of challenges the same time.  Sad to say, but true -- not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don't have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights.  We have to do both.  And that's what this budget is designed to do. When this forum we're in now was founded 30 years ago, its inaugural speaker declared that “America's best days should still lie ahead.”  With this budget, and with our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense, our best years will lie ahead.  And those men and women of the Department of Defense continue to defend our country, help make a better world for our children. Thank you. ",Remarks Previewing the FY 2017 Defense Budget,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/648466/remarks-previewing-the-fy-2017-defense-budget/
"Aug. 1, 2017","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. G.K. Chesterton once said: “Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water, and yet drink death like wine.”i. Senator Peters, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, Secretary Speer – wonderful words. General Milley, great words. Sergeant Major Dailey, but most of all, to Charlie Tigers and Specialist Five Jim McCloughan... Cherie, you married well to a most wonderful person. They met at the Messiah, a reminder for all you young troops to go to church. To the holders of the Medal of Honor who are here today, between you, Charlie Tigers, and Jim, you remind us of the gravity of the decisions we make in this building, the support we owe in this building, and the enduring truth of combat – the need for a level of physical stamina that goes beyond words to describe it. I would just tell you that your example, your story are welcome here with all the humbling impact it has on every one of us, regardless of rank. You’re a comrade in arms who reminds us what it is we’re all about. “Left unsung,” a Greek poet wrote many, many years ago, a couple thousand, “Left unsung even the noblest deed will die.”ii. And thanks to the U.S. Congress, we are now going to make certain that story will not die when Charlie’s Tigers move on to meet their buddies. We will not deprive the rising generation of this vision of valor. For in the fullness of time, they will give us the heroes we hold up for them to be, for life. And that’s exactly what will happen in this building as each generation of warriors comes through the U.S. military. Today, Jim, we hold you up. And I tell you, sir, that while this honor is long overdue, it comes in earnest. We are very, very honored to have you, your bride, and your family here today. We stand in respect of you and of your warrior brothers and of your heroic sacrifice. You stand as a living example of America’s awesome determination to defend herself – or what President Trump called yesterday, and I quote, “America’s unbreakable spirit.” This son of South Haven, Michigan; a four-sport varsity athlete; a collegiate wrestler, football player, baseball player, he had planned for himself a life of quiet excellence in the classroom, giving a hundred percent there as your father had taught you, Jim, as a teacher, as a coach…and then destiny tapped him on the shoulder, as it does to some men. Jim McCloughan was drafted into the army at age twenty-two. And I remember those days. I showed the Army – I ran down and joined the Marine infantry when it came my way. Not the brightest draft dodger that ever walked the face of the earth. But I would tell you too, if we look at your Army service, we detect a higher purpose unfolding: your longtime love of athletics had bestowed a basic knowledge of sports medicine in you, and it was ideally situating you for the medical specialist mission. And your competitive spirit – which still shines through loud and clear today, soldier – and your physical daring, so often displayed on the football field, you would make yourself a lifeline on the battlefield. Eight thousand miles away from his Michigan home, near Tam Kỳ, Vietnam; in the most atavistic, and I would say primitive environment on earth, James McCloughan lived the “contradiction of courage.” There the man his comrades called “Doc” stood tall when every human instinct would have kept the ordinary man down flat on his stomach. And Jim, you were not ordinary, nor were your battle buddies that day. With the heat index over a hundred degrees when you assaulted into that area, Specialist Four Bill Arnold was thrown from his chopper when it was downed by enemy fire. Then-Private McCloughan, the varsity football player, ran one hundred meters over open ground, again when any natural instinct would have said ‘just get down’; dodging crossfire, to rescue his wounded brother-in-arms and carry him to safety. Remember the size of this soldier doing that – in the midst of that heat and that battle. Bill later wrote, “I had seen him do some unbelievable stuff to save other soldiers before, but now he was risking his life for me. Only ‘Doc’ McCloughan would run toward the enemy while everyone else was running away.” Hour after hour, Jim would rise again and again over those days. Later, when his platoon was ambushed and wounded soldiers lay exposed to enemy fire…as airstrikes rained metal down on the enemy and all around them…the wrestler from South Haven ignored a direct order to remain under cover and went repeatedly into the “kill zone” to save his comrades. Think of that word ‘repeatedly.’ He was so close to the assaulting enemy forces that Sergeants Joe Middendorf and Doug Hatten, M60 machine gunners, feared they’d shoot their own medic, who still remembers to this day the machine gun bullets flying by his head. They said: “I saw his clothing move as shrapnel hit him … Doc never flinched.” Though wounded, Private Jim McCloughan refused to evacuate. In a firefight, it’s the combat medic’s job to cheat death, and Jim knew it. When ordered to “Get on the chopper,” he replied simply, “You’re going to need me.” In fierce fighting the following day, Jim was wounded by shrapnel and small arms fire while treating soldiers in an open rice paddy. Night fell and supplies ran low. It was Private McCloughan who volunteered to hold a blinking strobe light in the dark – a beacon of hope to mark the place for the resupply drop. It was also a beacon for enemy fire. His lieutenant, Randall Clark, accurately assessed the situation: “McCloughan was a sitting duck.” The fire was so thick, the resupply bird could not make the drop; it left riddled by more than twenty bullet holes. When we think, Jim, of you lying there with the rocket-propelled grenades flashing overhead, the scriptures come to mind, Psalm 91: “You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day.” Though many fell around him; no harm could overtake Jim McCloughan. As darkness dragged towards dawn, he continued to fight; he kept his boys alive for the evacuation at sunrise. Kent Nielsen, now a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, was one of them. He said, “Without his aid, I believe I would have bled to death.” In forty-eight hours of close combat, Jim sustained multiple wounds from shrapnel and small arms fire. He voluntarily risked his life nine separate times to rescue the wounded. Only Providence and soldiers like those here today – who would not stop fighting – could bring him alive through such hell on earth. We wonder how anyone could have such confidence. In Jim’s words, “To be confident, you have to be fit, physically, psychologically – and your soul has to be fit. If you do the best that you can, nobody can ask for any more.” He did his best in Vietnam. And his best back home wasn’t too bad either. He saved the lives of ten members of his company on those days on the battlefield. He touched ten thousand lives over the next forty years in the classroom and on the athletic field. He resumed his chosen path, his dream job as teacher and a coach. For his life’s work; he has been inducted into three Michigan high school coaching halls of fame. Today, James McCloughan takes his place in this hall, where his name joins another hero of Nui Yon Hill: Private First Class Daniel Shea. In every significant way, we have their warrior brothers to thank for this reunion. They petitioned that Jim’s Bronze Star with Valor be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. It puts Jim’s name where it belongs. But he does not see the honor as his alone. He says, quote, “It’s really not a Jim McCloughan medal…it’s a Charlie Company medal.” We’ll remember that message. To the boys of Charlie Company, thank you. Jim held the beacon that night in 1969; today he is the beacon. We in the Department of Defense are humbled and honored to join you in holding him high, a guide to others to keep their souls fit and always do the best they can, always serve each other. Thank you. God bless you and the boys of Charlie Company. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. ",Medal of Honor Hall of Heroes Ceremony For Specialist Five James C. McCloughan,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1264495/medal-of-honor-hall-of-heroes-ceremony-for-specialist-five-james-c-mccloughan/
"June 3, 2017","Well, good morning.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, excellencies, fellow ministers.  And thank you, Dr. John, for having me here, the invitation.  And thank you to IISS, which is always a first-rate outfit, and runs conferences actually worth attending. It is a privilege to be here at this excellent conference in Singapore and to be in the company of so many senior defense officials from within and outside this region.  Shangri-La, I think, provides one of the finest opportunities available anywhere to broaden my perspective. And Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, Minister of Defense Ng, thank you for Singapore's unique and generous hospitality.  We always gain keen insight into the strategic currents of this dynamic region, from this outpost on the sea.  And I would also tell you that I first visited Singapore, it was in the last Millennium, in 1979.  And I've remained an admirer of Singapore's leadership and the people ever since. Ladies and gentlemen, my primary reason for being here is to listen.  My goal is to walk away with a more vigorous and more rigorous understanding of the challenges we face so we can jointly craft solutions. In that regard, I thought Prime Minister Turnbull last night brought clarity, sir, to the situation facing our nations, setting the stage for our conversation today.  And I must add, you gave us reason for optimism in the face of some rather daunting challenges.  And I think a dose of good Australian pragmatic optimism is always in order.  So, thank you, sir. Five United States states, including my home state of Washington, have Pacific Ocean shorelines.  The United States is a Pacific nation in both geography and outlook. And from my first trips as secretary of Defense and from Vice President Pence's first trips, Secretary of State Tillerson's trips, the American administration is demonstrating the priority we place on relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, a priority region for us. Specifically, in Vice President Pence's words during his trip to South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia, we have affirmed the United States, what he called our, “enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of the region.” That enduring commitment is based on strategic interests and on shared values of free people, free markets, and a strong and vibrant economic partnership, a partnership open to all nations, regardless of their size, their populations, the number of ships in their navies, or any other qualifier.  Large nations, as the Prime Minister reminded us last night, large nations, small nations, and even shrimps can all thrive in a rules-based order. Such an order benefits all nations.  America's engagement is also based on strong military partnerships, robust investment and trade relationships, and close ties between the peoples of our countries; ultimately, we all share this mighty Pacific Ocean, an ocean named for peace. We are proud so many young people from Pacific nations choose to come to American universities to study.  And we appreciate that many of our students attend universities in your countries because they return home enriched by your cultures. These people-to-people ties highlight the depth and the breadth of America's relationships with Asia-Pacific nations, and the importance the U.S. has in terms of its role in the region. This morning I want to focus on two broad subject areas, and hopefully make this time worthwhile for you, and open to a number of questions afterwards. The first area is America's view of the region's key security challenges.  The second is the approach we are taking alongside Asia-Pacific allies and partners to address those challenges. I note up front that in the security arena, we have a deep and abiding commitment to reinforcing the rules-based international order.  This order, as we all know, is a product.  It's a true product of so many nations' efforts to create stability.  And these efforts, we must remind ourselves so we don't take them for granted, these efforts grew out of lessons learned the hard way, from economic depression and catastrophic wars. The international order was not imposed on other nations; rather, the order is based on principles that were embraced by nations trying to create a better world and restore hope to all. Those principles have stood the test of time, like equal respect for the international law, regardless of a nation's size or wealth; and freedom of navigation and overflight, including keeping shipping lanes open, for all nations' commercial benefit. These principles underwrite stability and build trust, security, and prosperity.  The growing prosperity of the people in this region gives proof to the value of institutions such as the United Nations, ASEAN, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, all of which can spur economic growth.  They also remind us that each of us have a vested interest in each other's security. The United States will continue to adapt and continue to expand its ability to work with others to secure a peaceful, prosperous, and free Asia, one with respect for all nations upholding international law. Because we recognize no nation is an island isolated from others, we stand with our allies, partners, and the international community to address pressing security challenges and do so together.  As countries make sovereign decisions free from coercion, the region will gain increased stability and security for the mutual benefit of all nations. In our cooperative pursuit of that vision, we cannot ignore the challenges that you and I know we face. As Vice President Pence stated, the “most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific is North Korea.”  North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them is not new, but the regime has increased the pace and scope of its efforts. While the North Korean regime has a long record of murder of diplomats, of kidnapping innocent, killing of sailors, and other criminal activity, its nuclear weapons program is maturing is a threat to all. Coupled with reckless proclamations, the current North Korean program signals a clear intent to acquire nuclear-arm ballistic missiles, including those of intercontinental range, that pose direct and immediate threats to our regional allies, partners, and all the world. President Trump has made clear “The era of strategic patience is over.”  As a matter of U.S. national security, the United States regards the threat from North Korea as a clear and present danger. The regime's actions are manifestly illegal under international law.  There is a strong international consensus that the current situation cannot continue.  China's declared policy of a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula is our policy as well, and also that of Japan and the Republic of Korea. All nations represented in this room share an interest in restoring stability.  The Trump administration is encouraged by China's renewed commitment to work with the international community toward de-nuclearization. Ultimately, we believe China will come to recognize North Korea as a strategic liability, not an asset -- a liability inciting increased disharmony and causing peace-loving populations in the region to increase defense spending. As China's President Xi said in April, ""Only if all sides live up to their responsibilities and come together from different directions can the nuclear issues on the Peninsula be resolved as quickly as possible."" I agree with President Xi's words on this point.  And those words must be followed by actions by all of us. North Korea poses a threat to us all, and it's therefore imperative that we do our part, each of us, to fulfill obligations and work together to support our shared goal of de-nuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.  We are coordinating with the United Nations, allies, and partners to put new pressure on North Korea to abandon this dangerous path. I reiterate Secretary Tillerson's statement at the United Nations this last April.  He said, ""Our goal is not regime change” and we do not want to “destabilize the Asia-Pacific region.”  We will, however, continue to increase diplomatic and economic pressure “until Pyongyang finally and permanently abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs."" Specifically, the United States will maintain our close coordination and cooperation with the Republic of Korea and Japan, two democracies whose people want peace.  Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan, to include the employment of our most advanced capabilities, is ironclad. Moreover, we will take further steps to protect the U.S. homeland, as demonstrated by this week's successful ballistic missile defense test. While North Korea is an urgent military threat, we must not lose sight of other strategic challenges to regional peace and prosperity. And here I want to talk for a minute about China and the United States.  Because of its growing economic power, China occupies a legitimate position of influence in the Pacific.  We welcome China's economic development.  However, we can also anticipate economic and political friction between the United States and China. Yet we cannot accept Chinese actions that impinge on the interests of the international community, undermining the rules-based order that has benefitted all countries represented here today including, and especially, China. While competition between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable.  Our two countries can and do cooperate for mutual benefit.  And we will pledge to work closely with China where we share common cause. We seek a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China.  We believe the United States can engage China diplomatically and economically to ensure our relationship is beneficial -- not only to the United States and China -- but also to the region and to the world. All countries should have a voice in shaping the international system.  But doing so by ignoring or violating international law threatens all that this inclusive global community has built together during the last 70 years, an international system that grew out of the grim lessons of World War II and the immense suffering of millions of people. For example, the United States remains committed to protecting the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea, and the ability of countries to exercise those rights in the strategically important East and South China Seas. The 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration on the case brought by the Philippines on the South China Sea is binding.  We call on all claimants to use this as a starting point to peacefully manage their disputes in the South China Sea. Artificial island construction and indisputable militarization of facilities on features in international waters undermine regional stability. The scope and effect of China's construction activities in the South China Sea differ from those of other countries in several key ways.  This includes: 1)      the nature of its militarization; 2)      China's disregard for international law; 3)      its contempt for other nations' interests, and 4)      its efforts to dismiss non-adversarial resolution of issues. We oppose countries militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims unsupported by international law.  We cannot and will not accept unilateral coercive changes to the status quo. We will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows and demonstrate resolve through operational presence in the South China Sea and beyond.  Our operations throughout the region are an expression of our willingness to defend both our interests and the freedoms enshrined in international law. As Prime Minister Modi of India has stated so clearly, ""Respecting freedom of navigation and adhering to international norms [are] essential for peace and economic growth in the inter-linked geography of the Indo-Pacific."" China's growth over these last decades illustrates that the Chinese people have, benefitted enormously from these very freedoms.  Where we have overlapping interests, again I say, we seek to cooperate with China as much as possible. In areas where we disagree, we will seek to manage competition responsibly because we recognize how important U.S.-China relations are for the stability of the Asia-Pacific.  And we believe at this time China also recognizes this. We will also continue to work together with our long-time, steadfast allies to maximize regional security.  We will ensure we have the military means to keep the peace.  But we will not use our allies and partners, or our relationship with them, or the capabilities integral to their security, as bargaining chips. In addition to the challenges presented by North Korea and China, there is another situation we must all work together to address for the good of our nations and to ensure a healthy future for our peoples. Violent extremist organizations, as was noted by the Prime Minister last night, including fighters returning from the Middle East, and local individuals radicalized by malicious ideologies, seek to gain ground in Southeast Asia. Just last week, ISIS-linked militants in the Philippines attempted to seize part of Marawi City in Mindanao, attacking innocents, killing police and military, and taking worshippers hostage. ISIS also claimed responsibility for the brutal bombings that killed three police officers at a Jakarta bus station.  Now I'll just say right now, ladies and gentlemen, that we Americans, we stand in sympathy and support of those whose lives have been brutalized by such criminals. Together we must act now to prevent this threat from growing, otherwise it will place long-term regional security at risk and stunt regional economic dynamism.  We need only look at the chaos and violence that our friends in the Mid-East are contending with to see why we must swiftly and jointly address threats to our region. As President Trump emphasized during his first foreign trip in the Middle-East, we must defeat extremist organizations wherever they attempt to establish roots.  Not just in Iraq and Syria but also here in Southeast Asia. As such, the U.S. remains committed to leading the Defeat-ISIS Coalition effort -- an international team of 66 nations plus the Arab League, NATO, INTERPOL, and the European Union -- all fully committed at the political, military, and law enforcement levels to the destruction of ISIS. This heartbreaking attack we are observing right now on a city in Mindanao reminds us that terrorists intentionally make battlefields where the innocent live; these are also humanitarian fields, as we know, and we must all devote ourselves to ensuring a stable environment in which violent extremist organizations wither and die, not our innocent citizens.  And I know I speak for all of us in this room today, that we stand with the Philippines and the fight they're currently engaged in. For our counter-terrorism efforts to be successful, however, we must unify our efforts -- strengthen by moral clarity, political will, and implacable commitment to fully share the difficult and dangerous work this will require. In this effort we are partnering with a number of countries in the region, including Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, to improve information sharing and maritime domain awareness so regional leaders can deliver pragmatic protection for their people. Information sharing is vital if we are to maintain law and order against a foe that intentionally targets women, children, and the innocent in our countries. I am confident in our collective ability to make this vibrant and diverse region safer without sacrificing either its prosperity or its values. In light of these challenges, let me describe three ways in which Department of Defense, which I lead, is pursuing our common objective of regional stability. Our primary effort remains strengthening alliances.  This protects and promotes the principles we share with our steadfast allies.  History is compelling on this point:  Nations with strong allies that respect one another thrive and those without allies stagnate and wither. Alliances provide avenues for peace, fostering the conditions for economic growth with countries that share the same vision, while tempering the plans of those who would attack other nations or try to impose their will over the less powerful. I can note just several examples: I don't want to talk too long, but let me just make note of the United States and Japan are implementing the 2015 Defense Guidelines to enhance regional security across a wider spectrum of operations, cooperating ever more closely in the Asia-Pacific.  Japan is also contributing to the relocation of some of our forces to Guam, which is a significant strategic hub for our regional operations. We are working transparently in unison with the Republic of Korea to defend against the growing threats posed by North Korea's aggressive and destabilizing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. For the last 100 years, U.S. and Australian forces, Mr. Prime Minister, have shared the battlefield in every major conflict.  President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull recently commemorated a key part of our shared history, when our allied efforts in the Battle of the Coral Sea took place.  Our alliance remains relevant to regional stability in the 21st century as well. Our combined interoperability with allied forces -- enhanced through force posture initiatives that we are taking-- ensures we are prepared to cooperate during real-world crises.  Deterrence of war, however, remains our ultimate goal. We are helping to train, advise, and assist Philippine forces in their fight against violent extremist organizations in the south.  And I think we all owe that support to the Philippine government.  We also continue to support the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces to address the country's security challenges. During this challenging fight against terrorists, we will stand by the people of the Philippines and we will continue to uphold our commitments to the Philippines under the Mutual Defense Treaty. Our oldest ally in the region, Thailand, has been and will remain instrumental in in challenging the wide range of regional threats. Thailand has announced its intent to hold elections.  We look forward to our long-time friend's return to democratic governance and the expansion of our military-to-military relationship grounded in our everlasting confidence in the Thai people. In addition to our bilateral alliance relationships, we are encouraging an interconnected region.  These linkages are expanding -- including, but also independent of the United States, and that is a development we welcome. Besides strengthening our alliances, our second Department of Defense priority is to empower countries in the region so they can be even stronger contributors to their own peace and stability. The Pacific region countries represented here are obviously critical to strengthening and transforming the underlying security structure that has enabled tremendous regional prosperity. For we don’t take that peace and prosperity for granted. We call upon all countries to contribute sufficiently to their own security.  At the same time, we encourage them to actively seek out opportunities and partnerships with other like-minded nations, and we do the same, to sustain and maintain the peace. We will continue to engage closely with our partners, building on recent progress.  We are exploring new ways to address new challenges as well, from maritime security to the growing threat posed by the spread of terrorism in Southeast Asia. For example, we recognize India, the most populous democracy in the world, as a major defense partner.  We did so, in part, out of respect for India's indispensable role in maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean region. We are also conducting the first-ever transfer of a Coast Guard cutter to Vietnam, and we just completed the inaugural U.S.-Singapore air detachment in Guam, which will give an opportunity to the Singapore Republic to build interoperability between our forces. The Department of Defense remains steadfastly committed to working with Taiwan and with its democratic government to provide it the defense articles necessary, consistent with the obligations set out in the Taiwan Relations Act, because we stand for the peaceful resolution of any issues in a manner acceptable to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. But we also know that a stable region requires us all to work together, and that is why we support greater engagement with ASEAN.  Because no single bilateral relationship can get us where we want to go.  Only working in concert can take us forward. This year marks, ladies and gentlemen, the 50th anniversary of the birth of ASEAN, and the 40th anniversary of relations between ASEAN and the United States.  In America, we are proud of our four decades of working together, and we believe that our best days are ahead.  The future of ASEAN is bright, and that is good for all Pacific nations. Here I note Indonesian President Widodo's statement at the 2016 East Asia Summit:  “ASEAN must protect our home and ensure sustainable peace and stability…Hence we need a strong and comprehensive regional security architecture that could advance ASEAN centrality and more effectively contribute to security and regional stability."" Finally, our third effort at the U.S. Department of Defense is to strengthen U.S. military capabilities in the region, because security is the foundation of prosperity, enabling the flow of commerce. The United States seeks to integrate diplomatic, economic, and military approaches to regional concerns, enabling Secretary Tillerson and our diplomats to address tough issues from a position of strength. It is the role of the military to set the conditions for diplomacy to succeed.  The United States has consistently endeavored to use its Armed Forces to support stability to the Asia-Pacific, and to reinforce our diplomatic efforts. In our Congress, Senator McCain, Congressman Thornberry, and other American legislators have identified a need to strengthen U.S. operational capability in the region. And I look forward to working with them to develop an Asia-Pacific stability initiative that complements the ongoing, large-scale investment in our budget to improve and reinforce U.S. military capabilities across the region. And to give you a snapshot, ladies and gentlemen, currently, 60 percent of all U.S. Navy ships, 55 percent of Army forces, about two-thirds of fleet Marine forces are assigned to the U.S. Pacific Command area of responsibility.  Soon, 60 percent of overseas tactical aviation assets will be assigned to this theater. The congressional initiative that is being brought forward will expand investment in the Department of Defense, strengthening the rules-based order by better positioning us to support regional stability in a changing region. By further strengthening our alliances, empowering the region, and enhancing the U.S. military -- in support of our larger foreign policy goals -- we intend to continue to promote the rules-based order that is in the best interest of the United States and all of the countries in the region. And I would just say to our hosts here today, this unique forum is only possible because of our unique hosts.  Singapore is a beacon to this region and to the world.  Its openness, its mutual respect that it engenders, and the prosperity of this city-state allows us all to be here to discuss our differences in a positive environment.  And for that I am grateful. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and I look forward to your questions.

"Dec. 3, 2015","Good afternoon. Thanks for being here. Appreciate it. Before I turn to my statement on the subject about which I’d like to speak to you, I’d first like to offer my condolences to the families of those who were killed yesterday in San Bernardino, California. President Obama just spoke about this tragedy. We’re monitoring this situation closely, in coordination with the rest of the President’s national security team. Our highest priority, of course, is the protection of our people. The law enforcement community is taking the lead on this, and they’ll be able to provide more information as it becomes available. I’m confident they’ll have more answers in the days ahead. Let me now turn to my statement. When I became Secretary of Defense, I made a commitment to building America’s force of the future – the all-volunteer military that will defend our nation for generations to come. Like our outstanding force of today, our force of the future must continue to benefit from the best people America has to offer. In the 21st century, that requires drawing strength from the broadest possible pool of talent. This includes women, because they make up over 50 percent of the American population. To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half the country’s talents and skills. We have to take full advantage of every individual who can meet our standards. The Defense Department has increasingly done this in recent decades – in 1975, for example, opening up the military service academies to women, and in 1993, allowing women to fly fighter jets and serve on combat ships at sea. About the same time, though, DoD also issued the Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule, which still prohibited women from being assigned to units whose primary mission was engaging in direct ground combat. That rule was in turn rescinded in January 2013, when then-Secretary Panetta directed that all positions be opened to qualified women by January 1st, 2016 – that is, less than one month from today – while also giving the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, three years to request any exceptions, which would have to be reviewed first by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then approved by the Secretary of Defense. As many of you know, I was Deputy Secretary of Defense at the time. That decision reflected among other things the fact that, by that time, the issue of women in combat per se was no longer a question. It was a reality, because women had seen combat throughout the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – serving, fighting, and in some cases making the ultimate sacrifice alongside their fellow comrades-in-arms. We’ve made important strides over the last three years since then. We’ve seen women soldiers graduate from the Army’s Ranger School. We have women serving on submarines. And we’ve opened up over 111,000 positions to women across the services. While that represents real progress, it also means that approximately 10 percent of positions in the military – that is, nearly 220,000 – currently remain closed to women…including infantry, armor, reconnaissance, and some special operations units. Over the last three years, the senior civilian and military leaders across the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Command have been studying the integration of women into these positions, and last month I received their recommendations – as well as the data, studies, and surveys on which they were based – regarding whether any of those remaining positions warrant a continued exemption from being opened to women. I reviewed these inputs carefully, and today I’m announcing my decision not to make continued exceptions – that is, to proceed with opening all these remaining occupations and positions to women. There will be no exceptions. This means that as long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They’ll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars, and lead infantry soldiers into combat. They’ll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that previously was open only to men. And even more importantly, our military will be better able to harness the skills and perspectives that talented women have to offer. ‘No exceptions’ was the recommendation of the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Secretary of the Navy, as well as the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. While the Marine Corps asked for a partial exception in some areas such as infantry, machine gunner, fire support, reconnaissance, and others, we are a joint force, and I have decided to make a decision which applies to the entire force. Let me explain how I came to this decision. First, I’ve been mindful of several key principles throughout this process. One is that mission effectiveness is most important. Defending this country is our primary responsibility, and it cannot be compromised. That means everyone who serves in uniform – men and women alike – has to be able to meet the high standards for whatever job they’re in. To be sure, fairness is also important – because everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country, who can meet those standards, should have the full and equal opportunity to do so. But the important factor in making my decision was to have access to every American who could add strength to the joint force. Now more than ever, we cannot afford to have barriers limiting our access to talent. The past three years of extensive studies and reviews leading up to this decision – all of which we’re going to post online, by the way – have led to genuine insights and real progress. Where we found that some standards previously were either outdated or didn’t reflect the tasks actually required in combat, important work has been done to ensure each position now has standards that are grounded in real-world operational requirements, both physical and otherwise – so we’re positioned to be better at finding not only the most qualified women, but also the most qualified men, for military specialties. Another principle is that the careful implementation of integrating women into combat positions would be a key to success – implementation – and also that any decision to do so or not would have to be based on rigorous analysis of factual data. And that’s exactly how we’ve conducted this review. It’s been evidence-based and iterative. I’m confident the Defense Department can implement this successfully, because throughout our history, we’ve consistently proven ourselves to be a learning organization. Just look at the last decade and a half. We’ve seen this in war, when we adapted to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism missions in the wake of 9/11 and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We’ve seen it technically, as new capabilities like unmanned systems and cyber capabilities have entered our inventory. And we’ve also seen it institutionally, when we repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” In every case, our people have mastered change excellently – and they’ve been able to do so because their leaders have taken care to implement change thoughtfully, always putting the mission and our people first. We will do the same today. As we integrate women into the remaining combat positions, we must keep in mind the welfare and total readiness of our entire force. And as we focus on the individual contributions that each servicemember makes, we also have to remember that in military operations, teams matter. That’s why it’s important that the services chose to study both individual performance and team performance. And they not only made comparisons to other elite units, like NASA long-duration flight crews and police SWAT teams – they also worked with our international partners to examine how they have integrated women into ground combat roles. Again, how we implement this is key. As Chairman Dunford has noted, “simply declaring all career fields open is not successful integration.” We must not only continue to implement change thoughtfully, but also track and monitor our progress to ensure we’re doing it right – leveraging the skills and strengths of our entire population. And all of us have a role to play. As we proceed with full integration of women into combat roles in a deliberate and methodical manner, I am directing that seven guidelines be used to steer this implementation. First, implementation must be pursued with the clear objective of improved force effectiveness. Leaders must emphasize that objective to all servicemembers, men and women alike. Second, leaders must assign tasks and jobs throughout the force based on ability, not gender. Advancement must be based on objective and validated standards. A good example of this is SOCOM’s selection processes, which combine objective and subjective criteria in, I quote, a “whole person” concept that includes rigorous physical standards and also “strong moral character, leadership skills, mental agility, problem-solving skills, selflessness, maturity, and humility.” The third guideline is that for a variety of reasons, equal opportunity likely will not mean equal participation by men and women in all specialties. There must be no quotas or perception thereof. So we will work as a joint force to expertly manage the impacts of what the studies that have been done suggest may be smaller numbers of women in these fields that were previously closed. Fourth, the studies conducted by the services and SOCOM indicate that there are physical and other differences, on average, between men and women. While this cannot be applied to every man or woman, it is real and must be taken into account in implementation. Thus far, we’ve only seen small numbers of women qualify to meet our high physical standards in some of our most physically demanding combat occupational specialties…and going forward, we shouldn’t be surprised if these small numbers are also reflected in areas like recruitment, voluntary assignment, retention, and advancement in some of these specific specialties. Fifth, we will have to address the fact that some surveys suggest that some servicemembers, both men and women, have a perception that integration would be pursued at the cost of combat effectiveness. Survey data also suggests that women servicemembers emphatically do not want integration to be based on any considerations other than the ability to perform, and combat effectiveness. In both cases, leaders have to be clear that mission effectiveness comes first…and I’m confident that given the strength of our leaders throughout the ranks, over time these concerns will no longer be an issue. Sixth, as I noted, both survey data and the judgment of the services’ leadership strongly indicate that, particularly in the specialties that will be opened, the performance of small teams is important, even as individual performance is important. The seventh guideline has to do with international realities. While we know the United States is a nation committed to using our entire population to the fullest – as are some of our closest friends and allies – we also know that not all nations share this perspective. Our military has long dealt with this reality, notably over the last 15 years in Iraq and also Afghanistan, and we’ll need to be prepared to do so going forward, as it bears on the specialties that will be opened by this decision. With all these factors in mind, Chairman Dunford recommended that if we were to integrate women into combat positions, then implementation should be done in a combined manner, by all the services working together. And I agree, and that will be my direction. Accordingly, I am directing all the military services to proceed to open all military occupational specialties to women 30 days from today – that is, after a 30-day waiting period required by law – and to provide their updated implementation plans for integrating women into these positions by that date. Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva, will work with the services to oversee the short-term implementation of this decision, ensure there are no unintended consequences on the joint force, and periodically update me and Chairman Dunford. Before I conclude, it’s important to keep all of this in perspective. Implementation won’t happen overnight, and while at the end of the day, this will make us a better and stronger force, there still will be problems to fix and challenges to overcome. We shouldn’t diminish that. At the same time, we should also remember that the military has long prided itself on being a meritocracy, where those who serve are judged not based on who they are or where they come from, but rather what they have to offer to help defend this country. That’s why we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And it’s one other way we will strive to ensure that the force of the future remains so, long into the future. Today, we take another step toward that continued excellence. Thank you.

"Sept. 16, 2015","Thank you, Kyra.  Appreciate it.  Listen, it’s a privilege – it’s a privilege – for Stephanie and me to be here tonight.  And to be here among so many distinguished leaders and public servants is truly a testament to this organization – Dick, Sloan, and Sandy, Mary, and many many others, thank you, and Congressman, you honor us with your presence. On behalf of all the men and women of the Department of Defense, I first want to thank those who are here this evening, veterans, military families, thank you.  We’re here to honor you – your service, your sacrifice.  We never, ever take it for granted.  Because above all, it’s our people – it's our people – our brave men and women in uniform, it’s them, that make America’s the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  It’s them. Greeting every guest to every Fisher House across the nation, and I’ve been to many, is a steel plaque inscribed with these words: “Dedicated to our greatest national treasure – our military service men and women, and their loved ones.”
To Ken Fisher and the entire Fisher family: thank you for putting those words into action for 25 years, guided by an enduring truth that military families are the backbone of our force.  And our obligation to stand by them is a responsibility to be shared by all, not shouldered by a few. I have to tell you a story here, because this was made very clear in  2013, when Ken called us a few weeks before the government shutdown.  Congress’s failure threatened our ability to deliver funds promised to families of the fallen.
Ken will remember this – I was embarrassed and infuriated by the circumstances. But Fisher House was there, not only offering to fill the gap if need be, but going above and beyond – giving $25,000 to each of 30 families and helping cover transportation costs during that disgraceful period, so families could be there to pay their highest respect to loved ones who gave their last full measure of devotion to keep us safe and free. That powerful, behind-the-scenes dedication is the same dedication you’ll find every time you step foot in a Fisher House.
They’re much more than a place to stay – they’re warm and inviting, a sanctuary of community and camaraderie, and a source of motivation to push through hard days.  Healing comes in many forms, not just from caring doctors and nurses, but from loving family and friends.
That’s the magic of a Fisher House. “Remember us not for what we gave,” Zachary Fisher once said, “but for the hardships we helped ease, and for the friendships we helped to form.”  
For a quarter century, in critical times of need, you’ve given 250,000 families a home away from home.  You’ve given tens of thousands of airline tickets so families could be there at besides.  You’ve given countless husbands, wives, sons, and daughters scholarships so they can seize opportunities their loved ones helped defend.  And the list goes on. But meeting the needs of today’s military families is only half the battle. As you know well, the strength of our nation and the strength of our military are built on a community foundation. Supporting future generations of military families – and preserving our all-volunteer force – demands we continue to connect our military community to the broader American community. That’s a different challenge for us today than we’ve faced in past generations. Here’s why: today, roughly 1 in every 100 people in America volunteer to serve.
Our mission – our mission – is to ensure everyone else – those 99 others – can go to bed safely, hug their children, live their lives, dream their dreams, and not have to worry about their safety. But I like to say, security is like oxygen – if you have it, you don’t pay any attention to it; but if you don’t have it, it’s all you can think about.  So, paradoxically, the more our troops succeed, the easier it is for their success to go unnoticed.
But that’s exactly the kind of challenge Fisher House was built to take on.  In the early 2000s, when the first waves of wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan came home, Fisher House innovated, adapted, and built homes differently to meet the needs of a new generation of modern military families – without losing sight of the same, stalwart, Fisher House wisdom of a broad community-wide approach where we draw strength from shared responsibility. That's the key to success, today and into the future.  And that’s the remarkable foresight of Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher.
We see it in every Fisher House – assembled from donations across America, both large and small; from individuals to corporations; from million-dollar-checks, to airline miles, to jars of coins from lemonade-stands. All of that. And in that way, Fisher House leads by example; a model for broader support made possible by connecting the many-kept-safe to the few-who-bravely-step-forward-to-serve; a template to ensure we stay dedicated to our ‘greatest national treasure’ for years to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it.  Let me add one more story to the inspirational stories showcased here tonight.
More than anything, Killian White wants to be a soldier.  But he’s only 5 years old.  So in the meantime, he wants to do whatever he can to help the Army.
For his 5th birthday, instead of presents, Killian asked for donations to go to the Fort Bragg Fisher House, and it didn’t take long for him to blow past his goal of $1,000 bucks. Here’s what makes Killian’s story special: neither of his parents are in the military.  His mom, Kristen, says, “somehow love of the Army is just in his soul.”
That’s the game-changing power of the Fisher House. Because we’re not just civilian families, we’re not just military families, we are all American families – and when we take care of each other, our military and our nation are stronger for it. To all of you associated with Fisher House, thank you. God bless you.  And God bless all of our service men and women, past and present, and their families.

"Sept. 17, 2015"," Good afternoon.  General Selva, thank you. A little less than a month ago, three childhood friends were on a train bound for Paris when they heard a gunshot.  Amid screams and commotion of the passengers, they quickly focused on a man wielding an AK-47.  Almost instantly, one of them said, “Let’s go” and the three ran toward the shooter. Those three friends are with us here today.  Thank you, Alek, Spencer, and Anthony for which you did on that train and for joining us here. Distinguished guests, Senator Feinstein, Senator Wyden, Senator Merkley, Congressman Bera, colleagues here past and present, members of the Defense Department community, it’s a pleasure to come together to welcome and recognize Alek, Spencer, and Anthony, welcome them home, to celebrate the heroic action they took…at great risk to themselves…and to award them our highest commendations. We also want to recognize some of their friends and families here today.  To all of you, thank you.  You raised some great kids. Alek is a National Guardsman.  After returning home from a deployment to Afghanistan, he recently chose to enlist.  Spencer is a medic based at Lajes Air Base in Portugal, and, next month, he’s headed to Travis Air Force Base in California.  And Anthony is starting his year at Sacramento State University where I’m sure he’ll have the best “what I did on my summer vacation” story of everybody this fall. That’s because, after Alek said, “Let’s go,” he, and Spencer, and Anthony sprinted toward the gunman while he trained his rifle on them.  Spencer tackled the assailant and the three worked to disarm him.  As we know, Spencer was stabbed in that effort.  After they knocked out the gunman, they tended to other injured on board before paramedics and police arrived. It is an amazing story, right out of a movie.  And Alek, Spencer, and Anthony have rightly been celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic.  But I want to focus on the moment when they heard the gunshot, and when they took off toward it.  Think about that moment. When some took cover and ran, when others were unsure what to do, these three friends said, “Let’s go.”  And if that sounds familiar, it’s because it is. Last week, for example, we gathered here as a community to mark the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.  On that day, on United Flight 93, a group of passengers – with the words, “Let’s roll” – stood up and fought back against the terrorists who had aimed the plane toward Washington.  And while these heroes were lost, we will always remember and appreciate their courage and sacrifice. “Let’s go” should also ring true to many in this building…because it speaks to our mission here.  Each member of the Defense Department, in uniform and civilian, has chosen to dedicate themselves to standing between order and disorder, between the way of life we cherish and those who would threaten it.  And that’s one reason that America has the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Like Alek and Spencer, each man and woman who serves in our defense enterprise has looked at that world and at those risks and said, “Let’s go.” It’s a perfect example of the force that we have now…and the Force of the Future: active duty, guard, and civilian teamed together to produce a powerful force – acting agilely, in concert…each one important. And it’s also familiar because the words “Let’s go” are as American as these three friends are.  Time and again, challenge after challenge, at the sound of gunshots and danger, the world has turned to the United States, to its military, for help.  And generation after generation, we’ve answered with a simple “Let’s go” and the resolve necessary to beat back dangers and stand up for the values so many around the world hold dear. Ours is a world full of opportunities and challenges.  Thanks to young Guardsmen and airmen like Alek and Spencer and the many other soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines like them, and young citizens like Anthony, I’m confident that we will continue to grasp hold of the bright opportunities and meet the evil challenges…echoing these same, simple, stirring words of theirs – “Let’s go.” From the Pentagon to you three guys – well done.

"Feb. 19, 2015","Thank you. Thanks to my partner, Bob [Work], and thanks to all of you in this room. I think if I went around this room, two-thirds, three-quarters of you I know by name and in person. And it’s wonderful to be back with you again, and wonderful to be back with this wonderful institution. The last time I was in this auditorium, I was departing, I thought for the last time, and Marty Dempsey mistook me briefly for Ashton Kutcher. But only very briefly. And that was the last opportunity I had to be with you. But I’m very pleased to be back with you. It’s been a highest honor of my lifetime, and the highest honor that I think an American can have to be a Secretary of Defense. We have been blessed – Secretary Work indicated that I’ve worked for 11 secretaries of defense, and that’s true – and I think it’s true that our country has been blessed with the secretaries of defenses we have had. And the ones that I’ve worked for have been very distinguished. And in that connection, I want to extend a thanks to my predecessor, Secretary Chuck Hagel. I knew Chuck Hagel for decades before he became Secretary of Defense. I worked for him as Secretary of Defense, and as distinguished and as dedicated a public servant this country has never had exceeded than Chuck Hagel. So I thank him wherever he is now, I hope he’s relaxing somewhere, for what he did for all of us and for his dedication to this institution. I’m going to be brief, but I want to be very specific about how I see this job and what I’ll be doing and what my commitments and priorities are, and thereby what I’ll be asking you to reflect in your own accomplishment of your own jobs. The first and most important commitment for me always has been and always will be to you. And to that, I mean the greater you. I know this is getting filmed and anybody who has the opportunity in our greater force to see this, I mean all of you – those who make the greatest fighting force the world has ever known, and the finest and most decent fighting force the world has ever known. And that’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. It is civilians. It is contractors, as Bob said, because in our system, that’s the way we do things. That’s the total national team. And our – my – first commitment is to you, to your excellence, to your welfare. Bob mentioned the fallen, the families of the fallen, wounded warriors. I mean, I think we have to start there. When I started my career in defense, it was very, very rare that an American servicemember was wounded-in-action or killed-in-action. It was extremely rare. And when it happened, it was a big deal. It led the news on CNN. When I came to the department six years ago, that was a daily event. And when you went out on Saturdays to the hospital, there was a fresh group of freshly wounded every week, every single week. Week after week after week after week. Thank God those days are largely behind us – we never will know for how long, that is true – but I just think that we have to start there. We have to keep those people in our hearts every day. And that leads to me to a commitment to what is my largest responsibility in this job, which is to make sure that we never put anyone and their family in that circumstance without the greatest care and reflection about why we’re doing it and what its purpose is and what the benefit is for our nation and for the future. We have an obligation, those of us here in the Pentagon, to the entire force to make sure that they have everything that they need to accomplish their mission. And that means first of all appropriate compensation, because – and I always say you can’t pay people enough to do what we ask many of our people to do. And – but this needs to be a profession which is, whose honor is reflected in the way society honors it. And compensation is part of that. Compensation is only part of it because I think a member of our community knows that their entire value and satisfaction in doing what they do is only partly measured by what they’re paid. It’s also measured by whether there are people to the left and right of them who are equally capable, who are numerous enough to help them get their job done, who are well-enough equipped and well-enough trained that it’s safe for them to do what they’re doing, and that they can be successful doing what they’re doing. So there has to be a balance here. But the objective, which is the overall honoring of service, has to be paramount to us and that’s a generational – an intergenerational responsibility as well. We honor those who came after us or before us. We honor those who are in service today. And we need to look to how we’re going to honor those in the future. More about that in a moment. We are blessed in that our institution is unparalleled in the world and is held in the highest esteem in our society. And that’s something to be grateful for, but also to honor back. And we do that when we respect the dignity and the safety of each and every member of our community as well, and that’s a priority for me also. And then just to repeat, the most sacred responsibility I have as your Secretary of Defense is to make sure that the dedication and commitment that brought each of you into service is reflected in the way I conduct myself and in the care that I and others, rest of the leadership, express in each and every one of you. A second thing that you’ll see me doing in this role – and this is a very different job from the jobs I’ve had here in the past – is to be helping the President and our national leadership make the decisions that will keep us safe and protect our country and protect our allies and friends now and in the future. And the President, able as he is – and the people around him, able as they are – that’s just one guy. He needs help. He needs our best thinking, our best ideas, our best analysis. The fact that many of you have vast experience around the world, vast experience going back in, through the decades with what it takes to offer protection to our society – we need to bring that to bear to help him. We’re a large institution. We’re a beacon of quality, if I may say so, in the federal service. And so, we have a lot to offer our national leadership in helping them make decisions. I intend to be very active in doing that. And I will be counting on you to help me, and lift the great expertise of this department and all of its people to the service of the country’s national security decisions. I’ll be, at the same time, making sure that with the Chairman and the Vice, who’s here today, I am making sure that our President has the best military advice – in addition to what I will aim to make the best civilian advice he could have – so that he’ll have another channel into the excellence that is represented in this department. Two heads are better than one, and he’ll get both heads. Then, he will be expecting us, and I will be expecting you, to help me implement those decisions with the excellence for which this department is so long and justifiably known. We – in that connection, I should emphasize that I’ll expect each of you to be conducting yourselves in a way that reflects the trust that the country has in you, and the appropriateness of the role prescribed to you. And I don’t have any doubt that we’ll do that as we always have, but we need to retain our reputation for being the best and the most honorable. It’s a rough world out there. There’s a lot going on. I could start almost anywhere, but I’ll start where the headlines are – with ISIL and the barbaric acts that you see perpetrated in the Middle East, and the larger Middle East, and emanating there from. The historical throwbacks in Europe we’re witnessing in Ukraine now, the throwback to an era we thought we had left behind, and I think history ultimately will leave behind, but not everybody understands that right now. The unhealed wounds of the past and the absence of a custom security structure in the Asia-Pacific theater, where half of the world’s population and half of its economy resides. Something that can, is going very well, we can’t afford to let begin go poorly. The ongoing campaign and, I believe, very successful campaign in Afghanistan, but it’s not finished, and it needs to be won, I think can be. Many of you – I’ve given a lot of my own effort to that – many of you have given much, much more. Enduring problems like weapons of mass destruction, which have been with us for decades and decades, and newer ones in new domains, like cyber, that have been with us for a much shorter time. So, there’s plenty to do, and you all know what. And that’s what our country expects us to do, is to protect them from these dangers. But, I want to say one other thing to you, to, which is I always try to, in my own mind, and in my own heart, and as I talk to people, remind them that miserable as all that is, and miserable as that – all that seems to be, we have tremendous, bright opportunities in front of us also as a country. We are not only the finest fighting force in the world, but I think we’re the brightest beacon of hope as a country in the world. If you want evidence of that, take a look at who has all the friends. United States has friends and allies in every part of the world. No other country on earth can say that. In fact, our antagonists have none or few. And that’s a reflection of the fact that our values, and our conduct, and our leadership are followed because people like them, and they’re attracted to them, and they want – not because they have – to. And if you want to call that exceptionalism, I call that exceptionalism. And it’s not because we say so, it’s because the behavior of others says so. We have an economy and an economic model that has long been a beacon to the rest of the world, and despite our fits and starts, continues to be. So, we have a lot going for us, a lot to be proud of – starting here, but everywhere – and we have tremendous opportunities if only we can all come together and grab hold of them. And that brings me to the third thing I wanted to say about, which is coming together and grabbing hold of many opportunities in – in front of the – front of us. One which you can’t talk about defense without mentioning is our budget and resource challenge, sequestration, and so forth. And that is unsafe. It’s dangerous. It’s wasteful. It’s unwise. And you’ll see me doing everything I can – or everything a Secretary of Defense can do – to try to bring our country together and get us out of the wilderness of sequester. We don’t belong there. That’s not what our people deserve. It’s not what this institution deserves. It’s not what the problems and opportunities that I was describing require and deserve. And we’ve got to get out of that. That said, that’s just part of the future that we need to embrace. If we’re going to convincingly make the case to our people that they need to spend more on their defense – which I believe they do – we need to, at the same time, show them that we know we can do better at spending that money. And that we won’t be able to do unless we are open, and unless we are embracing the future. We’re the most wonderful institution and fighting force in the world. That’s what I inherit from those who went before me. That’s what you all inherit from those who went before you. That’s what we owe to the future. And so, my third preoccupation is to the future. And for us to excel in today’s world, in the future, we have to be open. We have to be open to change. We have to be open to what’s going on out there in the world. We have to be open to the wider world of technology, the wider world of culture, the wider world of how people do things. And maybe they have an idea that we haven’t had yet, and that we need to bring inside. So, if we’re going to continue to be the best, we need to be open to the future and open to change. And you’ll see me challenging you all and myself to be open in that way. We’re also one of the oldest institutions in the country and we’re very proud of our traditions. But at the same time, if we’re going to continue to be that, we have to be open, and we have to change. And one last note on that, which is very important to me. We’re going to hand this place off to the next generation. And we need to be asking ourselves, what will make us attractive to them? What will make us compatible with them? What’s the environment within which they can do their very best? And they’re different from us. All generations are different. And all people, when they’ve gotten to our age, start talking about the next generation’s different. It’s actually true. So, these are – these kids are different. And we need to think about how we make the conditions of service attractive to them, what it takes to make them effective in an organization or on a battlefield. They behave differently, they think differently, they’ve grown up differently. They’re used to a different kind of environment around them, and we have to make ourselves attractive to them. 9/11 was a great galvanizing thing for our country. It brought many people into our midst. It motivated many people to want to be part of this enterprise. And that was a terrific thing, but at a horrible price. And no one could wish something similar upon us in the future. But you do have to ask yourself, what is going to make us attractive in the future? And are we thinking that so that we continue to have young people who choose this life and this mission and this commitment who are as good as you are? That’s not something I take for granted. But it’s not something I’m pessimistic about, either. I think we have something compelling about our commitment, our mission, and the excellence that we represent in these generations that are before me, that those to come will find attractive. And they’ll want to follow not in our footsteps, because they aren’t going to want to do that. They’re going to want to do it in their own kind of – their own way, but in the same general direction that we came. You’ll see me in the best way that I know how trying to speak to them and speak to the country as a whole about us and who we are. And be trying to reflect who you are. And speak to the generation to come and appeal to them and challenge them to fill the shoes of the really excellent people I see in front of me. You are excellent. You mean everything to me. The people of this department are so very wonderful. And my wife, Stephanie, and I are so very devoted to you. That’s why I’m back. It’s that simple. It’s you. It’s the mission. And I look forward once again to being in your ranks and working with you. Thanks so much.

"Nov. 15, 2014","Fred [Ryan], thank you very much for a generous introduction. I am not only happy to be out of Washington – but to be in California. And I’m particularly happy about being with a group of people who really understand this business as well as any group of people in America today – from our industrial base to our current leadership in the Defense Department, to our members of Congress, those who have had the responsibility of leading the Defense Department. Two of those distinguished leaders are here. I’m well aware of your panels today. From some of what I heard, they were engaging, and I know everyone always appreciates that. So this opportunity for me to be here to share some thoughts about the enterprise that I lead along with many of the other leaders from the Department of Defense who are here with you today and you have heard from. We all appreciate this forum. And I want to also again thank Fred Ryan for his many years of leadership and how he has shepherded the Reagan legacy and assured the continuation of an important library that represents an important leader, that represents an important time and expanding on that. He’s going to a new job, as you all know. I’m not sure it’s legitimate – but it’s a new opportunity, and he’ll do a tremendous job there. I also want to note my friends Leon Panetta and John McCain, who will be honored tonight, and will have more to talk about regarding what they have done for this country, and why they are being recognized appropriately so tonight. And I’m particularly pleased to be part of that event this evening. I also want to note the soon departure, escape, voluntarily of Buck McKeon from Congress, and his responsibilities that he has carried out so well as leader of the House Armed Services Committee. And to you, Buck, and to your family: much continued success and happiness. Thank you for your friendship and your partnership in the two years that I have served in this job. They have meant a lot to me. And I know you will be missed by your colleagues. You will be missed by the men and women of the Defense Department that you have spoken up for over a long career. And to our senior leadership who are here today and have participated in panels, thank you. You have had an opportunity to hear, I think, from most of them. I particularly thank you for the job you’re doing at a difficult time. It’s never easy; I know that. But this is not a one-person job, or two-, or three-person job. This is a job that requires everybody to be part of it. And your leadership, all of you, is as critical as any part of our future and the security of this country. So thank you for what you do. And I appreciate it also – just being back here in this library. The Department of Defense is undergoing a defining time of transition. After 13 years of war fought by an all-volunteer force, we’re facing a reshaping of our enterprise by a fiscal environment plagued by constant budget uncertainty and a large, continuing decline in resources, and by a historic realignment of interests and influences around the world. Enduring and emerging powers are challenging the world order that American leadership helped build after World War II. In the Middle East, in North Africa, the order within and between states is being recast in ways that we’ve not seen for almost a century, often leaving dangerous ungoverned spaces in their wake. In West Africa, a virus 1,000 smaller than a human hair has in less than a year infected over 13,000 people, killed 5,000 people, and shook governments and health care systems alike. In Europe, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine represents one of the most blatant acts of state-on-state aggression on that continent since the end of World War II. And in the Asia-Pacific competition between rising powers threatens to undermine the stability that has allowed the region to prosper and thrive. We are at the beginning, not at the end, of this realignment. And as Henry Kissinger recently put it in his new book, World Order, “only a subtle balance of restraint, force, and legitimacy will help forge a new order” – an order that will be years, and probably decades, in the making. This means that the missions and focus of the Defense Department will continue to be marked and defined by transition. As these dynamics unfold, the U.S. military is engaging in today’s crises and security challenges around the world – degrading ISIL, helping stop the spread of Ebola, and reinforcing our NATO allies. Few would have predicted these missions a year ago, and as you all know well, uncertainty is the only certainly in an interconnected world of seven billion people. DoD’s responsibilities are to be prepared to address a broad range of contingencies and unpredictable crises well into the future. That means we must prepare our defense enterprise – prepare our defense enterprise for the challenges of that uncertain future. We face the rise of new technologies, national powers, and non-state actors; sophisticated, deadly and often asymmetric emerging threats, ranging from cyberattacks to transnational criminal networks; as well as persistent, volatile threats we have faced for years. Our long-term security will depend on whether we can address today’s crises while also planning and preparing for tomorrow’s threats. This requires making disciplined choices and meeting all our nation’s challenges with long-term vision. That is what the Defense Department is doing today. We are not waiting for change to come. We’re not waiting for that change to come to us. We’re taking the initiative, getting ahead of that change – that change we know is coming – and making the long-term investments we need for the future. I’d like to take few minutes to discuss two of the most important investments we’re making – and the leadership and the partnership that will be required to sustain them: First, investing in our nation’s unrivaled capacity for innovation. Many industrial leaders are here today in this audience, and know exactly what is at stake in this challenge. This is important so that in the face of mounting challenges, our military’s capability, technological edge, strategy, and readiness will continue to stay ahead of any potential adversary. And second, reforming our defense enterprise: to ensure that our military’s foundation is reliable, agile, accountable, and worthy – worthy of the men and women who serve in it. I know in some of the panels today that Secretary James, General Dunford, Admiral Greenert, and others talked about some of these issues, in particular readiness. Today our military has nearly 400,000 personnel stationed or forward-deployed in nearly 100 countries around the world, from Afghanistan to the Philippines to Guatemala. This continued forward presence has helped anchor America’s global leadership for decades, with its unmatched technological and operation edge. That superiority has never been guaranteed, and today it is being increasingly challenged. Technologies and weapons that were once the exclusive province of advanced nations have become available to a broad range of militaries and non-state actors, from dangerously provocative North Korea to terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and Hezbollah – all clear threats to the United States and its allies. And while we spent over a decade focused on grinding stability operations, countries like Russia and China have been heavily investing in military modernization programs to blunt our military’s technological edge, fielding advanced aircraft, submarines, and both longer range and more accurate missiles. They’re also developing new anti-ship and air-to-air missiles, counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities. America must continue to ensure its ability to project power rapidly across oceans and continents by surging aircraft, ships troops and supplies. If this capability is eroded or lost, we will see a world far more dangerous and unstable, far more threatening to America and our citizens here at home than we have seen since World War II. Without our superiority, the strength and credibility of our alliances will suffer. Our commitment to enforcing long-established international law, rules of the road, and principles could be doubted by both our friends and our adversaries. Questions about our ability to win future wars could undermine our ability to deter them. And our Armed Forces could one day go into battle confronting a range of advanced technologies that limit our freedom of maneuver. This would allow a potential conflict to exact crippling costs and put at risk too many American lives. America does not believe in sending our troops into a fair fight. Bob Gates, Leon Panetta, all of our predecessors believe that – and were responsible for ensuring that didn’t happen. But that is a credo we will not be able to honor if we do not take the initiative and address these mounting challenges now. DoD must continue to modernize our nation’s capabilities and sustain its operational and technological edge. And we must do so by making new, long-term investments in innovation. We’ve accomplished this before. In the 1950s, President Eisenhower successfully offset the Soviet Union’s conventional superiority through his New Look build-up of America’s nuclear deterrent. In the 1970s, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, working closely with Undersecretary – and future Defense Secretary – Bill Perry, shepherded their own offset strategy, establishing the Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program that helped develop and field revolutionary new systems, such as extended-range precision-guided munitions, stealth aircraft, and new intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. All these systems drew upon technological developments, such as the micro-processing revolution, that had unfolded over the course of a few decades. The critical innovation was to apply and combine these new systems and technologies with new strategic operational concepts, in ways that enable the American military to avoid matching an adversary “tank-for-tank or soldier-for-soldier.” Because subsequent leaders, including President Reagan, sustained these investments on a bipartisan basis – bipartisan basis, bipartisan basis – these investments helped America build and hold our military edge for decades. Today I’m announcing a new Defense Innovation Initiative – an initiative that we expect to develop into a game-changing third ‘offset’ strategy. This new initiative is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century. It will put new resources behind innovation, but also account for today’s fiscal realities – by focusing on investments that will sharpen our military edge even as we contend with fewer resources. Continued fiscal pressure will likely limit our military’s ability to respond to long-term challenges by increasing the size of our force or simply outspending potential adversaries on current systems, so to overcome challenges to our military superiority, we must change the way we innovate, operate, and do business. The new Innovation Initiative will draw on the lessons of previous offset strategies and ensure that America’s power-projection capabilities continue to sustain our competitive advantage over the coming decades. To achieve this, we are pursuing several lines of effort. Our technology effort will establish a new Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program that will help identify, develop, and field breakthroughs in the most cutting-edge technologies and systems – especially from the fields of robotics, autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data, and advanced manufacturing, including 3D printing. This program will look toward the next decade and beyond. In the near-term, it will invite some of the brightest minds from inside and outside government to start with a clean sheet of paper, and assess what technologies and systems DoD ought to develop over the next three to five years and beyond. The Defense Innovation Initiative will explore and develop new operational concepts, including new approaches to warfighting, and how we balance DoD’s investments between platforms and payloads. It will focus on new approaches on war-gaming and professional military education – I know General Dunford talked about training and readiness today, work that has already begun in the area, that our military leaders started, professional military education. And it will focus on our most important asset – our people – by pursuing both time-honored leadership development practices, as well as emerging opportunities to re-imagine how we develop managers and leaders. I’ve asked secretary – Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work to guide the development of this initiative, and he will lead a new Advanced Capability and Deterrent Panel to drive it forward. This panel will integrate DoD’s senior leadership across the entire enterprise: its policies and intelligence communities; the armed services; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and research, development, and acquisition authorities. I expect the panel to propose important changes to the way DoD diagnoses and plans for challenges to our military’s competitive edge, and I also expected to break with many of our usual ways of doing business, encouraging fresh thinking that is focused on threats and challenges to our military superiority, not simply adapting what is on the books today. The panel must also face a new challenge ahead, and that is one of many, but the fiscal [sic] challenge: the fact that many, if not most, of the technologies that we seek to take advantage of today are no longer also in the domain of DoD development pipelines or traditional defense contractors. We all know that DoD no longer has exclusive access to the most cutting-edge technology or the ability to spur or control the development of new technologies the way we once did. So we will actively seek proposals from the private sector, including those firms, and from those firms and academic institutions outside DoD’s traditional orbit. The Defense Innovation Initiative will shape our programs, plans, and budgets. As the initiative matures over time, I expect its impact on DoD’s budget to scale up in tandem. Successfully investing in these long-term priorities requires the foundation of a sound, resilient, and accountable defense enterprise…because ensuring the health and vitality of DoD as an institution is critical to our ability to prepare for the future. As the world in which we operate changes, we must change, too. We must revitalize, renew, and, when necessary, reform. That applies to everything we do, from special operations and airstrikes to health care for troops and their families. As you all know, the Department of Defense is the world’s largest institution. Some of you here today who once had the responsibility for leading this institution know well how large and complex it is. This institution employs roughly one percent of America’s population. DoD’s property includes more than 560,000 buildings and structures at more than 520 facilities, stretching over 27 million acres of land. Any institution of this magnitude and complexity – and breadth of mission and responsibilities – is slow to change. But the reality is that change will continue to be forces upon us – on terms not of our choosing – unless we take the initiative ourselves now. So DoD must continue to engage in wide-ranging and often uphill reform. We will take the controls [sic] and work from there. The uncontrollables we’ll factor in, and we’ll deal with. Management is a key part of all of this. How will it be managed? Who will manage it? We’re pursuing reform not just for the sake of reform, but wise reform that makes the enterprise stronger and better prepared for the future. Everything else – everything else we do depends on it. Yesterday I announced actions DoD is taking to revamp our nuclear enterprise, including new resources and shakeups in organizations, policy, and culture. It will take years of committed action to fix problems that have accumulated over many, many years. But we will fix them – and ensure that our nation continues to have a safe, secure, ready, and effective nuclear deterrent. As I told airmen at Minot Air Force Base yesterday afternoon, I will personally hold DoD’s leaders accountable to ensure that promises translate into action, and that action translates into real and sustainable improvements. To further shift the department’s energy, focus, and resources toward supporting our frontline operations, I’ve ordered full reviews of DoD’s business and management systems. The first reviews are underway now, starting with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. DoD must embrace better business practices, better business practices that are core to any modern enterprise, private or public. This means upgrading our business and information technology systems and processes, striking the right balance between civil service and contractor support, and avoiding duplication of support functions in OSD and the services. After years of postponement and delay, we are making progress in moving DoD toward greater financial accountability. Much because my predecessors focused on this issue, the Marine Corps became the first service to earn a clean audit earlier this year, and DoD as a whole remains on track to be fully, completely, audit-ready by no later than 2017. That goal could not sound more dull, I know. But as you all know – especially those from the private sector who run big companies – that goal is essential for DoD’s effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability into the future. To streamline the way the Pentagon does business, DoD is also continuing the large acquisition improvement and reform efforts led by Frank Kendall, who is sitting here in the front row today. As you all know, Frank Kendall is our Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The aim of his effort is to – in partnership with the Congress – overhaul the legal framework for DoD acquisitions by reducing unnecessary paperwork so that we can focus on key, strategic priorities. In addition to all of these efforts, we’re also pursuing concrete results and improvements through many other reform initiatives that are essential to the long-term health and readiness of the force. These include improvements to our military health care system, our military justice system, and accounting for our nation’s missing personnel. They also encompass a renewed focus on military ethics and professionalism, systems integration with the Veterans Administration, and eliminating sexual assault in the military. We’re all committed to ensuring that the Defense Department sustains its focus on all of these efforts. At the same time, we are dealing with crises all over the world, and we’re reforming our processes, because they will ultimately shape – they will ultimately shape our ability to develop any new capabilities, strengthen our partnerships, and honor our enduring commitments to our people and their families. It is their service that makes possible everything we do. We must never lose sight of that. The Department of Defense has been making the hard choices and mustering the flexibility required by new realities. But to succeed, we need the support and partnership of Congress, especially at a time when demands on our military are surging and our resources are shrinking, and our abilities to manage our institution are being more and more limited. Since 2011, DoD has been forced to operate on continuing resolutions every year, impairing our ability to plan, invest, and reform. As I reminded Congress earlier this week before Chairman McKeon’s committee, you cannot run any institution on continuing resolutions. It will not work – especially the national security of this country. We need actual budgets – budgets that give us certainly and predictability – and the flexibility to make the management internal decisions about what’s required to deal with current and future threats for this country. We have also been prevented from undertaking critical cost-savings measures, especially reducing excess basing and facilities. Despite numerous efforts and almost 10 years since the last round, DoD has been unable to secure another round of base realignment and closure. Today, DoD has 24 percent excess capacity in our basing and facilities – excess capacity that is costing us billions of dollars every year, money that could otherwise be invested in maintaining our military’s edge. We need Congress to help end this excess spending. We also need Congress to support proposed reform to military pay and compensation. No one who wears our nation’s uniform is overpaid – no one is overpaid for their service. But since 2001, DoD’s pay and benefits for service members has outstripped private sector compensation growth by about 40 percent. For military personnel, DoD has proposed continued but more moderate pay increases; continued but more moderate growth of tax-free housing allowances; and modest increases to insurance co-pays. But again, we need Congress to act. And the longer we defer the tough choices, the tougher they will be to make down the road and the more brutal the outcome. Without the ability to make programmatic adjustments like retiring aging aircraft, and without base realignment and closure, the department will face a bill of about $30 billion over Fiscal Years 2016 to 2020. Denying DoD the flexibility to make modest adjustments to military compensation is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars more. Factor in new bills arising from urgent investments – including our new effort to renew our nuclear enterprise, space infrastructure, and technological modernization – and the hole in our budget could grow to more than $70 billion over the 2016-2020 Future Years Defense Program. That is the equivalent of what our Navy – what our Navy will spend to buy all its battle force ships over the next five years. Or more than what the Air Force – more than what our Air Force will spend to buy all of its aircraft over the next five years. Let me underscore that all of this comes before we address the possibility of a return to sequestration in Fiscal Year 2016. Sequestration is still the law of the land, and it will return unless the law is changed. The continuation of sequestration could impose nearly $1 trillion – $1 trillion in cuts to our defense budget over 10 years. As you all know, we have already begun taking those deep cuts over the last few years. That would devastate our military readiness and threaten our ability to execute our nation’s defense strategy. Congress has an opportunity this year to help the Defense Department, and all the leaders of DoD and I will work closely with Congress on this issue as we address the realities of what this fiscal pressure is doing to this institution and to our future security. Ladies and gentlemen, last week we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Today, we remember a President whose vision and resolve helped inspire ordinary people to seize an extraordinary moment – and tear down that wall. America and its allies prevailed over determined Soviet adversary by coming together as a nation, for the good of the nation. Over decades and across party lines, we worked together to make long-term, strategic investments, including in innovation and reform of our nation’s military…investments that ultimately helped us face down the Soviet military and force the Soviet regime to fold its hand. We made tough choices then. And we must make tough choices now. We must navigate through this period of transition and realignment, and we must face up to the realities and challenges that our defense enterprise confronts today…so we will be ready for the challenges of the future. If there was one legacy of Ronald Reagan, it is that legacy. If we make the right investments in our partnerships around the world, in innovation, and in our defense enterprise, we will continue to keep our nation’s military and our nation’s global leadership on a strong and sustainable path for the 21st century. As President Reagan once said, our nation is at “a time for choosing” – for Congress, for political parties, for our country…ultimately, the American people – and each of us. We must choose wisely.

"March 22, 2016","I. PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, Members of the Committee:  Thank you for inviting me here today, and for your steadfast support for the men and women of the Department of Defense (DoD), military and civilian alike, who serve and defend our country all over the world.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget submission for the Defense Department. At this time last year, we were all facing the bleak prospect of looming budget sequestration, and the damage its return would do to our people and our mission.  I’m grateful that our country’s leaders were able to come together last fall to avert that dismal future, and reach a budget deal that – after several years of fiscal turmoil and reductions – has allowed for greater investment in all our elements of national security and strength.  That was what I urged since becoming Secretary of Defense, including in last year’s budget testimony before this committee, and given the threat environment we face around the world, forging that deal was the responsible thing to do.  It allows our military personnel and their families to know their future more than just one year at a time, which they deserve.  It lets our defense industry partners be more efficient and cutting edge, as we need them to be.  And, perhaps most importantly, it sends a signal to the world – to friends and potential foes alike – of our nation’s strength and resolve. The President’s budget submission accordingly adheres to that budget deal – requesting a total of $582.7 billion for the Defense Department in FY 2017, for both the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds combined.  How we plan to invest those funds, along with our planned investments for the next five years – as detailed in the customary Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that’s included in the President’s budget submission – are critical to DoD’s ability to carry out our mission of national defense with the excellence the American people expect of their military, which is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. As you know, no one got everything they wanted in the budget deal – I said last year that we needed to rise above our differences, and I’m glad many members of Congress were able to do that – so in budgeting and programming for FY 2017, we had to make responsible choices.  The President’s budget submission reflects those choices, and we need your support for them.  This is particularly true for prudent and necessary reforms – some of which the Congress has long denied, in spite of the cost to both DoD and to America’s taxpayers.  Indeed, while DoD is grateful to this and the other defense committees for your support for the budget deal, it is also the defense committees that in recent years have been tying our hands on reform, as I will address later in this testimony. We should remember, however, that the budget deal only covered two years.  Unless Congress addresses the years beyond it and heads off sequestration, DoD will face $100 billion in cuts from 2018 to 2021, which would introduce unacceptable risks.  So Washington will need to come together once again – not unlike last year, and two years before that – to provide stability and protect our national security. That’s important, because in this budget submission, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we must fight and win today’s fights, we must also be prepared to deter and if necessary fight and win the fights that might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on changing its shape in fundamental ways – making choices and tradeoffs to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future.  II. A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT Let me now describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe, as we have been since the end of World War II.  As we fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era. Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused on large-scale counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DoD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full-spectrum warfighting.  While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it’s also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL, and the resurgence of Russia, being just the most prominent examples. This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we’ve seen in history following major wars.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different – and more diverse and complex in the scope of its challenges – than the one we’ve been engaged with for the last 25 years, and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. Accordingly, five evolving challenges are now driving the focus of DoD’s planning and budgeting. Two of these challenges reflect a recognition of – return to, in some ways – great power competition.  This is something we haven’t seen for some time, and that requires heightened focus given its potential impact on our nation and the world.  The first such challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  The second is in the Asia-Pacific, where we haven’t faced great power competition since the end of World War II, and where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  One is North Korea, which remains dangerous to both us and our allies – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran – because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and doesn’t limit DoD in any way, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Challenge number five, no less important than the other four, is our ongoing fight to counter terrorism, and especially defeat ISIL – most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also where it is metastasizing, in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere – at the same time as we’re protecting our homeland.  While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective and in our budgeting we must also take into account that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, countering terrorists will be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of DoD and other national security leaders. DoD must and will address all five of these challenges as part of its mission to defend this country.  Doing so requires some new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities. Key to our approach is being able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  This means we must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action, or make them deeply regret it if they do.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we are able to win, on our terms.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict. We have this ability with respect to North Korean and Iranian military forces, as well as in executing the military aspects of countering terrorists, as we’re doing now against ISIL.  That won’t change, even as we know that military power alone cannot prevail without capable and motivated local forces to sustain ISIL’s defeat – nor can the United States alone deliver a lasting defeat – against the toxic ideology of terrorists like ISIL that have so little regard for the lives of fellow human beings. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and are continuing to advance military systems that threaten our advantages in specific areas, and in some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives in ways they hope would preempt a response by the United States.  Because of these facts, because the implications of any great-power conflict would be so dire for the United States and the world, and because of those nations’ actions to date – from Ukraine to the South China Sea – DoD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting to ensure we maintain our advantages in the future. While we do not desire conflict with any of these nations – and, to be clear, though they pose some similar defense challenges, they are very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they choose to pursue.  That is the responsible course of action for the Defense Department.  Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and even as we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them, which is itself a key part of deterrence. Our military must be balanced with the proper size and capability to defeat any attack against U.S. forces and our allies.  And because of the decisions in this budget, our military will be better prepared for both present and future challenges, and better positioned to deter, and if necessary fight and win, wars against even the most high-end of potential adversaries. As this budget addresses those five evolving challenges, it also seizes great opportunities – in supporting new and innovative operational concepts; in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, including undersea, cyber, space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities; in reforming the defense enterprise; and in building the force of the future.  I will address the investments we’re making to do so later in this testimony.  III. SUPPORTING THE STRENGTH AND WELLNESS OF TODAY’S FIGHTING FORCE Before I address how this budget ensures we meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, I want to first emphasize our enduring commitment to supporting the men, women, and families of the world’s finest fighting force.  Above all, this means exercising the utmost care in decisions involving the deployment and employment of our troops.  It also requires devoting a significant share of our budget every year toward supporting the people, military and civilian alike, who execute DoD’s missions around the world. To ensure we have a force that’s ready to carry out today’s missions, this budget invests in the four main things that every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine needs to do their job – the right training; the right equipment; the right force size, meaning the right number of people alongside them; and the right compensation. The Right Training In FY 2017 and beyond, the budget makes critical investments in training throughout the force to rebuild toward full-spectrum combat readiness and continue recovering from the damage caused by sequestration in recent years – though, it’s important to remember that restoring readiness requires not only sufficient funding, but also time.  The budget maximizes use of the Army’s decisive action Combat Training Centers, funding 19 total Army brigade-level training rotations.  It provides robust funding to sustain the Navy and Marine Corps’ current training levels and readiness recovery plans for FY 2017 – optimizing Navy training while maximizing the availability of naval forces for global operations, and fully funding the Marine Corps’ integrated combined arms exercises for all elements of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  And, because recent operational demands like the fight against ISIL have slowed the Air Force’s return to full-spectrum readiness, the budget increases funding – as part of a $1 billion increase over the FYDP to support Air Force readiness – to modernize and expand existing Air Force training ranges and exercises here at home, providing pilots and airmen with more realistic training opportunities when they’re not deployed. The Right Equipment The budget also makes important investments to provide our men and women in uniform with functioning, well-maintained equipment so that when we send them into the fights of today, they’re able to accomplish their mission and come home safely.  For example, to address the Navy and Marine Corps’ growing maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F-18 depot maintenance capacity, and it buys an additional 16 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and FY 2018 – providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps’ 4th-generation fighter aircraft fleet so it’s ready and capable for today’s missions.  To help ensure the Air Force has enough ready and capable aircraft for both combat missions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), the budget funds improvements in the avionics and electronic warfare systems of legacy fighter and bomber aircraft, and it supports the Air Force’s ‘get well plan’ for remotely-piloted aircraft. The budget also makes critical investments in every domain to research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and equipment our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  I will detail those investments later in this testimony. The Right Force Size The flexibility provided by last fall’s budget deal allowed us to maintain DoD’s desired targets across the FYDP for end-strength and active-reserve mix for our ground forces – without it, sequestration likely would have forced further reductions.  Therefore, the budget stabilizes our total ground force end-strength by the end of FY 2018 with an Army of 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 56 total Army brigade combat teams and associated enablers – and a Marine Corps of 182,000 active-duty Marines and 38,500 Marine reservists.  For the Navy, the budget continues to grow the size, and importantly the capability, of the battle fleet – providing for 380,900 active-duty and reserve sailors in FY 2017, and an increase from 280 ships at the end of FY 2016 to 308 ships at the end of the FYDP.  The budget also supports an Air Force of 491,700 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard airmen – maintaining 55 tactical fighter squadrons over the next five years, and providing sufficient manpower to address high operating tempo and shortfalls in maintenance specialists for both tactical fighters and remotely-piloted aircraft. The Right Compensation In FY 2017, the budget provides $177.9 billion in pay and benefits – including health care, housing allowances, commissaries, retirement, and other benefits – for DoD’s 2.1 million military personnel and their families.  I will discuss DoD’s proposed reforms to some of these areas later in this testimony.  To help make sure DoD is competitive for the best talent, the budget includes a department-wide pay raise of 1.6 percent in FY 2017.  This is an increase above FY 2016’s pay raise of 1.3 percent. It’s important to note that of all the cuts we’ve taken to our previously-planned budgets since the Budget Control Act was passed, including cuts from sequestration – altogether so far totaling at least $800 billion over ten years – less than 9 percent of those reductions came from military compensation proposals.  This should make clear that we’ve worked extremely hard to protect our people, and that we do need to address some places where savings can be found, such as through modernizing and simplifying our military healthcare system, which I address later in this testimony. More Than Military Readiness Beyond ensuring the combat readiness of America’s military, our commitment to the force of today also encompasses what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people.  We’re putting a priority on preventing and eliminating sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, investing $246 million in FY 2017 to help support survivors, reduce retaliation for reporting, and eradicate these crimes from our ranks – and soon, DoD will deliver to Congress our strategy on addressing retaliation, in particular.  We’re also helping provide transition support and advocating for employment opportunities for veterans, investing a total of $109 million in FY 2017 so our people can make the most of their potential and keep making a difference when they complete their service in uniform.  And we’re fostering greater diversity of our force, because our strength depends on being open to the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards – young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, open, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. That’s one reason why we’re opening all remaining combat positions to women, so that we have access to 100 percent of our population for every position in the all-volunteer force and every American who can meet our exacting standards has the full and equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  That said, since the declaration that opens all career fields to women is by itself not sufficient for their full integration, I’ve asked the military services to mitigate any concerns about combat effectiveness by incorporating my seven guiding principles – transparent standards, population size, talent management, physical demands and physiological differences, operating abroad, conduct and culture, and assessment and adjustment – into their implementation plans, which I have reviewed and approved and are now being carried out.  First and foremost, this means the services will continue to apply objective standards for all career fields to ensure leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.  This may mean in some cases, equal opportunity may not always equate to equal participation.  Integration provides equal opportunity for men and women who can perform the tasks required; it does not guarantee women will fill these roles in any specific number or at any set rate, as adherence to a merit-based system must continue to be paramount.  Also, we must incorporate concrete ways to mitigate the potential for higher injury rates among women, and leverage lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan to address concerns regarding operating in areas where there is cultural resistance to working with women.  We must address attitudes toward team performance through education and training, including making clear that sexual assault or harassment, hazing, and unprofessional behaviors are never acceptable.  Our core beliefs in good order, discipline, leadership, and accountability are foundational to our success in integration.  And it is absolutely critical that we embark on integration with a commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and in-stride adjustment that enables sustainable success. Finally, it’s important to remember that our commitment to the force of today is not limited to those who serve in uniform.  In FY 2017, it also includes $79.3 billion to support our civilian workforce of 718,000 Americans – men and women across the country and around the world who do critical jobs like helping repair our ships and airplanes, providing logistics support, developing and acquiring weapon systems, supporting survivors of sexual assault, and helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured personnel.  The budget includes $7.7 billion to support our military families, because they serve too.  It includes $3.1 billion to help take care of our wounded warriors, to whom our commitment is and must remain as strong as ever.  And it includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  IV. ADJUSTING TO STRATEGIC CHANGE Another significant portion of our budget goes toward DoD’s current operations all around the world, in every domain, to help defend our country, our allies, and our interests.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to helping the President address key national security challenges, and my priorities for how we must adjust to strategic change – in countering terrorists, whether ISIL, al-Qaeda, or others; in taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression; in operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; in deterring Iranian aggression and malign influence; in standing alert on the Korean Peninsula; and in addressing threats from multiple directions in cyber, space, and electronic warfare.  We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges; we must and will address them all, and not only be prepared across the spectrum of conflict, but also for the possibility of multiple conflicts in overlapping timeframes. Countering Terrorism It is clear that our mission of countering terrorists and other violent extremists around the world will be with us for some time.  The Department of Defense has strong counterterrorism capabilities, and we continue to deploy them to protect America. Dealing ISIL a Lasting Defeat We must and will deal ISIL a lasting defeat, which is why the budget provides $7.5 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Inherent Resolve.  This investment will be critical to continuing to implement and accelerate the coalition military campaign plan that the United States has developed, that our key allies support, and that focuses on three military objectives:  One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by attacking its two power centers in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria; these cities constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic and ideological centers of gravity, which is why our plan has big arrows pointing toward both.  Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear.  And three, our most important mission, which is to protect the homeland. To eliminate the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, DoD is enabling local, motivated forces with critical support from a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities-ranging from airstrikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice and assistance.  It must be local forces who deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, because only they can secure and govern the territory by building long-term trust within the populations they liberate.  We can and will enable such local forces, but we cannot substitute for them.  Accordingly, the budget’s investment in the counter-ISIL campaign includes $630 million for training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces, and $250 million for enabling Syrian anti-ISIL forces. This is a worthy investment, as we’ve already started to see our investments over the last several months start to pay off.  For example, it was Iraqi soldiers who took back the Ramadi city center, reversing a loss the Iraqi army suffered last spring.  Our support to them included advanced training, tactics, air support, and the portable bridges that carried the Iraqi military across the Euphrates River and into the decisive fight.  Ramadi, like recent Iraqi gains in Bayji, Tikrit, and Sinjar, demonstrates that the approach we are taking is having an effect as Iraqis prepare for what will be a tough fight for Mosul.  Likewise in Syria, local anti-ISIL forces we’ve enabled with equipment and ammunition have had successes in Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, and Shaddadi.  It is imperative to keep building on this momentum. As we work with our partners to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas like North and West Africa and Afghanistan.  Having taken out ISIL’s leader in Libya in November, we are also now prepared to step up pressure on ISIL in Afghanistan to check their ambitions there as well. Finally, at the same time that we accelerate our campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners – there can be no free riders.  That’s why last month in Brussels I convened the first-ever meeting of defense ministers from 27 other countries involved in the military coalition to defeat ISIL to follow up after I personally reached out to dozens of defense ministers to urge them to consider filling critical military and non-military needs in the campaign.  And I’m gratified to report that coalition members responded to our challenge – and not only NATO allies like Canada and the Netherlands, but also Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  In sum, nearly 90 percent of the countries participating in the coalition’s military campaign have either stepped up their role or committed to do so in the coming days.  Their decisions to expand air operations, send more trainers, provide logistical support, help with reconstruction, or make other contributions will all help our coalition intensify the counter-ISIL campaign and bring about ISIL’s lasting defeat. None of this changes the fact that our counter-ISIL campaign is a hard and complex fight.  We have tactical and strategic goals, but they will take time – and, as is often said, the enemy gets a vote.  For our part, we will remain focused, committed, and resilient because this is a fight we can, must, and will win, as our efforts to accelerate our campaign are already producing real and promising results. Ensuring Long-Term Stability in Afghanistan After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan, we have to make sure our gains there stick, which is why the budget continues to support our two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).  In support of those two missions, the President announced last fall that the United States will maintain a continued presence of 9,800 troops through most of 2016 before drawing down to 5,500 troops by January 2017.  As I told our troops there when I visited them this past December, while Afghanistan remains a dynamic fight, we are determined to ensure that terrorists – regardless of whether they’re al-Qaeda or ISIL – never have or find safe haven there again. The budget provides $41.7 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel – including funding to support our posture in U.S. Central Command, the full funding of $3.4 billion to support the ANDSF, and $1.4 billion to support other coalition partners.  Importantly, this allows us to continue strengthening and developing the ANDSF’s aviation, logistics, intelligence, and special operations capabilities, with the intent of reducing their dependency on us over time.  Also, in addition to upholding our commitments to Afghanistan, the Afghan people, and other partners, the budget reflects that the United States will retain several key locations in 2016 and beyond, including facilities in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.  As we do so, the United States will support the continuation of the NATO mission in Afghanistan in 2016 and beyond, and continue to consult with our NATO allies and partners to ensure that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan are mutually supportive. Our continued presence in Afghanistan is not only a sensible investment to counter threats that exist and stay ahead of those that could emerge in this volatile region; it also supports the willing partner we have in the government of Afghanistan.  It is in the United States’ interest to help them succeed, for the benefit of their security, our security, the region and the world. Establishing an Alternative to the Detention Facility at Guantanamo The Defense Department is resolutely committed to responsibly closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay through the establishment of an alternative detention facility.  I share the President’s belief – and the belief of many in Congress – that doing so would benefit our national security, which is why DoD will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when we have substantially mitigated any security risks to the United States. Over the last four months, we completed transfers for 16 detainees, bringing the population to 91.  Like every transfer that came before them, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government. That said, because many of the remaining detainees currently cannot be safely transferred to another country, we need an alternative to this detention facility.  Therefore, I support the President’s plan to establish and bring those detainees to an appropriate, secure, alternative location in the United States.  I appreciate that Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal, and, in accordance with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD delivered that plan to Congress in February.  We look forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate design, legislative foundation, and geographic location for future detention and to lift the restrictions preventing the responsible closure of the facility at Guantanamo. Supporting and Maintaining our Counterterrorism Capabilities In addition to the specific funds outlined above, the budget also reflects other investments we’re making in DoD’s posture to ensure we can counter terrorism effectively wherever it challenges us.  For example, the budget sustains our robust funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, allocating $10.8 billion in FY 2017.  To bolster our partners in fighting terrorism, it requests $1 billion for our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  And it supports the development of DoD’s transregional counterterrorism strategy, which I’d like to outline now. The terrorist threat is continually evolving, changing focus, and shifting location, requiring us to be flexible, nimble, and far-reaching in our response.  Accordingly, the Defense Department is leveraging the existing security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe, so that we can counter transnational and transregional terrorist threats like ISIL and others in a sustainable, durable way going forward.  From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain last October to those I visited in Jalalabad, Afghanistan last December, these locations and associated forces in various regions help keep us postured to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds.  In a practical sense, they enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent terrorist group affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the main entities themselves.  This transregional approach is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this in action was our November strike on Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill him.  To help implement this strategy, including in the fight against ISIL and its metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, the budget includes an additional $175 million in FY 2017 – $9 million to help bolster our posture in the Levant, and $166 million to help us better address threats in North and West Africa in conjunction with our European partners. Because the accelerating intensity of our precision air campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria has been depleting our stocks of some of the GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets we use against terrorists the most, the budget invests $1.8 billion in FY 2017 to buy over 45,000 more of them.  Furthermore, DoD is also exploring increasing the production rate of these munitions in our industrial base – calling on America’s great arsenal of democracy to help us and our partners finish the job of defeating ISIL. Also, because our remotely-piloted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft play an important role in countering terrorism, the budget includes $1.2 billion for FY 2017 and $4.5 billion over the FYDP to increase the number of around-the-clock permissive ISR combat air patrols from 70 today to 90 by the end of FY 2018.  Using a mix of MQ-9 Reapers, Extended Range Reapers, and MQ-1C Advanced Gray Eagles – and comprising 60 patrols from the Air Force, 16 from the Army, and 14 that are government-owned and flown by contractors for the Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command – these investments will be critical as the need for ISR continues to increase around the world. Finally, because it helps us maintain a larger Air Force fighter fleet that can drop more smart bombs in our counter-ISIL air campaign, the budget also further defers the A-10 Thunderbolt’s final retirement until 2022.  I saw some of the A-10s that are flying bombing missions against ISIL when I was at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey last December, and we need the additional payload capacity they can bring to the fight.  Accordingly, we are also changing the rate at which we will phase out the A-10 as we approach 2022, as I will explain later in this testimony. A Strong and Balanced Strategic Approach to Deter Russia Despite the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community, and also Russia itself so well for so long.  In Europe, Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  In Syria, Russia has been pouring gasoline on a civil war, fueling the very extremism Russia claims to oppose.  At sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow’s nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to brandishing nuclear weapons. To be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy, even as it may view us that way.  But make no mistake – we will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all.  That’s why the United States is taking a strong and balanced strategic approach in response to Russia’s aggression:  strengthening both our allies and ourselves, including through investments in this budget, while also giving Russia the opportunity, if it chooses, to rejoin the international community and work with us where our interests align. Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, DoD’s budgets have made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies; for example, contributing to NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  This budget builds on that significantly, and breaks new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterring – and, if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future.  The 20th century NATO playbook was successful in working toward a Europe whole, free and at peace, but the same playbook would not be well-matched to the needs of the 21st century.  Together with our NATO allies, we must write a new playbook, which includes preparing to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, better integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to adapt and respond to new challenges and new threats. To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative to make a total investment of $3.4 billion for FY 2017 – more than quadrupling the $789 million that we requested last year – allowing us to increase the amount of prepositioned equipment sets in Europe as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies.  This increase supports the persistent rotational presence of an armored brigade combat team for 12 months out of the year, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European friends and allies.  It supports more warfighting gear, including forward-stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017.  It supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such that this equipment – along with assigned Army airborne and Stryker brigade combat teams and Marine Corps heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – will allow us to rapidly form a highly-capable combined-arms ground force of division-plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C tactical fighter squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft. In addition, the budget reflects how we’re doing more, and in more ways, with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, this includes building toward a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap up to Norway’s North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe’s first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to our British allies.  And, given Russia’s use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – the budget supports more rotational presence of U.S. special operations forces exercising in Europe. The budget also significantly funds important new technologies that, when coupled with revised operational concepts, will ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  While I will address these areas in greater detail later in this posture statement, investments that are most relevant to deterring Russia include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-range anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber, and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for electronic warfare, space, and cyberspace.  The budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent. Consistent with our strong and balanced approach, the door will remain open for Russia to reassume the role of respected partner going forward.  While that would be greatly welcomed by the United States, and the Department of Defense, it’s up to the Kremlin to decide – first by demonstrating a willingness to return to the international community. Operationalizing the Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific The budget also supports operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.  In a region home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy, for 70 years the United States has helped underwrite a stable security environment that allowed the people, economies, and countries in the Asia-Pacific to rise and prosper.  We fully intend to continue these efforts so that bright future can be possible for everyone in this important region. Accordingly, the budget helps improve DoD’s geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable posture in the region, through which the United States seeks to preserve peace and stability, and maintain our strategic advantage in an area that’s critically important to America’s political, economic, and security interests.  Investments in the budget reflect how we’re moving more of our forces to the region – such as 60 percent of our Navy and overseas Air Force assets – and also some of our most advanced capabilities in and around the region, from F-22 stealth fighter jets and other advanced tactical strike aircraft, to P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, to our newest surface warfare ships.  They also reflect how we’re developing and implementing new posture initiatives – in places like Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore, as well as modernizing our existing footprint in Korea and Japan – and continuing to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones, from India to Vietnam.  And they reflect our efforts to support and strengthen a regional security architecture that benefits everyone – from strengthening and modernizing our alliances, to bolstering our ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to building the security capabilities of our many friends and allies, who increasingly want to do more with us in the region.  In support of this effort, the budget fully supports our five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative begun in FY 2016. For this region, as it does with Europe, the budget also significantly funds important new technologies to ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These investments – which I will outline later in this testimony – are important for ensuring our forces can go anywhere, at any time, and succeed in whatever mission we ask of them. It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, because it’s good for the region and good for our collective interests.  That includes China.  As we welcome the growth and prosperity of all Asia-Pacific nations, it is clear that the U.S.-China relationship will be complex as we continue to balance our competition and cooperation.  There are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China – for example, we’ve agreed to four confidence-building agreements, including one meant to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  But there remain areas of concern. For one, the United States joins virtually everyone else in the region in being deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  U.S. military presence in the region is decades-old, has been instrumental in upholding the rules-based international system, and has laid the foundation for peace and security in the region.  Our interest is in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight, full and unimpeded lawful commerce, and that disputes are resolved peacefully.  To accomplish this, we will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  We also expect China to uphold President Xi’s pledge not to pursue militarization in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. Also, we are closely watching the long-term, comprehensive military modernization program that China, as well as other countries, continues to pursue.  While there is no question that the United States retains a decisive military edge in the Asia-Pacific today, China is investing in capabilities to counter third-party – including the United States – intervention during a crisis or conflict.  These capabilities include ballistic and cruise missiles of increasingly greater range and accuracy, counter-space and offensive cyber capabilities, and electronic warfare systems.  To maintain a lasting competitive advantage, DoD is taking prudent steps to preserve and enhance deterrence for the long term.  The budget reflects this, including with investments to continue adapting our forces, posture, operations, and capabilities to deter aggression, defend our allies, and sustain our military edge in the Asia-Pacific. Deterring North Korea The budget also supports investments necessary to deter North Korean provocation and aggression, ensure our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready and capable to ‘fight tonight’ if necessary, and defend against threats emanating from North Korea against the United States and our allies.  This includes threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, against which DoD is fully capable of defending the U.S. homeland.  Our position has been, and remains, that North Korea must abide by its international obligation to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and stop its provocative behavior. North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6th and its ballistic missile launch on February 7th were highly provocative acts that undermine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.  The United States condemns these violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again calls on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.  We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. DoD remains fully capable of fulfilling U.S. treaty commitments to our allies in the event of a North Korean attack, and we’re working with our Republic of Korea allies to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat.  I spoke with my South Korean counterpart shortly after the nuclear test, and reiterated our commitments as strong and steadfast allies.  Also, a few hours after the ballistic missile launch, the United States and the Republic of Korea jointly announced the start of formal consultations to discuss the feasibility of deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the Korean Peninsula at the earliest date. Checking Iran’s Malign Influence while Strengthening Regional Friends and Allies The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges, but there, as everywhere, DoD’s budget – and accordingly our actions and strong military posture – is guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s interests.  Defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria, which I discussed earlier, is of course one of those interests, but amid this region’s complexity and uncertainty, we also have other interests of great importance, which are to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; and to check Iran’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  That’s why DoD maintains tens of thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along with our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action places significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, it does not limit in any way what DoD can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance in order to provide all options, as the President has directed, should Iran walk away from its commitments under this deal.  So if Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can immediately respond and rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. This budget invests in maintaining those abilities going forward, which is important, because Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is contributing to disorder in Yemen, while still directing hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel.  To continue to meet our commitments and enhance our cooperation with our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, the budget makes critical investments – including $146 million to support Israel in FY 2017.  This reflects our unshakeable commitment to Israel and its security, with funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow, and other cooperative defense programs – not only ensuring that Israel can defend itself, but also preserving and enhancing Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is a cornerstone of our defense relationship. Meanwhile, with critical investments in other areas, the budget enables DoD to continue to advance our preparations, posture, partnerships, and planning to preserve the President’s options for any contingency.  It strengthens the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran’s ability to coerce its neighbors.  And it helps us stay ahead of the risks posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, naval forces, cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the region. Addressing Threats in Cyber, Space, and Electronic Warfare Even as we make adjustments in our budget to address the five evolving challenges posed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda, we are also making adjustments to address emerging and increasing threats that transcend individual nations and organizations.  That’s because, as we confront these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also led to vulnerabilities that potential adversaries are eager to exploit. As I made clear when I released DoD’s new cyber strategy last April, we have three missions in cyberspace – first and foremost, to defend our networks, systems, and information; second, to help defend the nation and our interests from cyberattacks of significant consequence, working with other departments and branches of government; and third, to provide options that can augment our other military systems.  Given the increasing severity and sophistication of the threats and challenges we’re seeing in cyberspace – ranging from ISIL’s pervasive online presence to the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management – the budget puts a priority on funding our cyber strategy, investing a total of $6.7 billion in FY 2017 and $34.6 billion over the FYDP.  This is a $900 million increase over last year’s budget.  While these funds will help us continue to develop, train, and equip our growing Cyber Mission Force, and also make new technological investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and capabilities – both of which I address later in this testimony – the budget also reflects our efforts to make a fundamental shift toward a culture of accountability in cyberspace, from instituting a DoD-wide cybersecurity scorecard to monitor our progress to increasing individual knowledge about practical ways to defend against cyber intrusions.  Our people understandably hold themselves to very high standards when it comes to caring for, attending to, using, and being accountable for the weapons they carry into battle, and we must do the same when it comes to interacting with our networks and cyber capabilities – not only among our cyber warriors and IT professionals, but throughout the DoD workforce. While at times in the past space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that’s not the case anymore, and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  This means that as we continue to ensure our access to space so we can provide capabilities like reconnaissance, GPS, and secure communications that enable and enhance our operations in other domains, we must also focus on assuring and defending these capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs of others.  Though competitors may understand our reliance on space, we will not let them use it against us, or take it away.  As I will discuss later in this testimony, this budget makes important investments to do just that – sustaining and building on the major shifts DoD began funding in last year’s budget submission – with a total of more than $22 billion for space in FY 2017.  With the presence of so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet:  free and open to all. Finally, high-end competitors have also invested in electronic warfare systems as a cost-effective way to challenge the United States and try to blunt our technological advantage.  By jamming our radars, communications, and GPS, these systems would seek to disrupt the integrated capabilities that allow our forces to identify, target, reach, and destroy an enemy with precision.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why this budget deliberately invests in buying more electronic protection and resiliency for our current systems as well as developing more advanced capabilities.  I will address these investments in more detail later in this testimony.  V. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE The other significant share of our budget goes toward making sure DoD will be ready for the future.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to create a Defense Department that’s open to change and new ideas to ensure a better future for both DoD and the nation, and my priorities in doing so.  These are best understood through the four key pillars of this commitment – namely, updating and refining warfighting strategies, operational concepts, and tactics; driving smart and essential technological innovation; building the force of the future; and reforming the DoD enterprise. While I will describe what we’re doing in each of those areas momentarily, the dynamic strategic environment I described earlier in this testimony explains why such change is so important – not for the sake of change, but for the security of this country.  We cannot let those challenges overtake us; we have to stay ahead of them and stay the best.  That’s why as Secretary of Defense I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box. Updating and Refining Warfighting Strategies, Operational Concepts, and Tactics Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win both the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, and to make sure that the plans apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats to our security, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  We’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners think about what happens if they have to execute their plan at the same time as another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into the trap of presuming the contingency they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  And we’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we must be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them. As I mentioned earlier, DoD is continuing to embark on a force-wide, all-service transition from an era focused on counterinsurgency operations to an era focused on the full spectrum of military operations.  While we do so for many important reasons, it’s also important to note that we don’t want to forget or turn our back on counterinsurgency, but rather enable most of our forces to be capable of doing a lot more than just that.  A smaller segment of our force will still specialize in these skills, and DoD will retain the ability to expand our operational capacity for counterinsurgency missions should it become necessary. The transition to full-spectrum operations is and will be coupled with demonstrations to clearly signal it and make that signal credible, which is key to conventional deterrence.  The same is true for our investments in capabilities – in new technologies, new operational concepts, and also innovative ways for how we use what we already have – these must and will be demonstrated as well.  This is accounted for in the budget, as are other investments we’re making to recommit ourselves to deterrence across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict. Recognizing the immense value that wargaming has historically had in strengthening our force in times of strategic, operational, and technological transition – such as during the interwar years between World War I and World War II, when air, land, and naval wargamers developed innovative approaches in areas like tank warfare and carrier aviation – this budget makes significant new investments to reinvigorate and expand wargaming efforts across the Defense Department.  With a total of $55 million in FY 2017 as part of $526 million over the FYDP, this will allow us to try out nascent operational concepts and test new capabilities that may create operational dilemmas and impose unexpected costs on potential adversaries.  The results of future wargames will be integrated into DoD’s new wargaming repository, which was recently established to help our planners and leaders better understand and shape how we use wargames while also allowing us to share the insights we gain across the defense enterprise. Driving Smart and Essential Technological Innovation The investments this budget makes in technology and innovation, and the bridges it helps build and rebuild, are critical to staying ahead of future threats in a changing world.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially DoD.  Today, not only is much more technology commercial, but the competition is global, with other countries trying to catch up with the advances we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber, and space.  So now, as we have in the past, DoD must invest to ensure America pioneers and dominates these and other technological frontiers. DoD is therefore pursuing new technology development along with new operational concepts, and new organizational constructs – all of which are reflected in or supported by this budget submission – to maintain our military’s technological superiority and ensure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.  How we do this is important, because while the Cold War arms race was characterized mostly by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, this era of technological competition is uniquely characterized by an additional variable of speed, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy; what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to upgrade them and repurpose them to be used in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats. In particular, this means leveraging the capability of current and emerging technologies, including commercial technologies wherever appropriate.  It means demonstrating and seeding investments in new capabilities and concepts to counter advanced anti-access, area-denial challenges across all domains and in every region where they persist – a particular focus of DoD’s effort to develop a third offset strategy.  And also, it means investing in and operationalizing our security by leveraging advances in cyber, space, electronic warfare, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other areas.  Our technologies and capabilities must be able to operate so that no matter what any of our enemies might throw at them, they are able to defeat attempts to be hacked. Accordingly, this budget invests a total of $183.9 billion in FY 2017, and $951 billion over the FYDP, to help research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and capabilities our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  For the second year in a row, the budget increases funding for our research and development accounts, which total $71.8 billion in FY 2017.  That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services, in our dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country, and in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing. At the same time that DoD is making investments in technologies themselves, we’re also investing in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s vibrant, innovative technology community and forging more connections with the commercial technology base – and it’s reflected in our budget.  In FY 2017, this includes $45 million for our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx), which we opened in Silicon Valley last August to build relationships and better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem.  It also includes $40 million for our pilot program with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel, leveraging its venture capital model to help find innovative solutions for some of our most challenging problems.  And it includes $137 million to support our public-private partnership-funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics that I announced in Silicon Valley last August.  In all these areas, similar to how DoD’s historic investments in things like GPS and the Internet later went on to yield great benefits for not just our security but also our society, we hope the investments we’re making in some of these fields along with our partners in the technology industry will lead to incredible advances that today we can only imagine. Importantly, technological innovation must be done in concert with operational innovation.  It’s not enough to have or create new technologies or weapon systems; how they are used is key.  The budget reflects work DoD has been undertaking in this area though multiple lines of effort.  First, there’s our Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program – an effort named after the mid-1970s project that brought together a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts who paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth – and also our Advanced Capability and Deterrence Panel.  Both focus on identifying and charting longer-term, leap-ahead investments for strategies and capabilities that will give us an advantage several decades from now, and together they make up nearly 60 percent of our science and technology investments in this budget submission. Now, to focus on maintaining our near-term advantage, DoD has an office that we don’t often talk about, but that I want to highlight today.  It’s called the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO).  I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense to reimagine existing DoD, intelligence community, and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  I picked a talented physicist to lead it.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but also has the rare virtue of rapid development and the even rarer charter to keep current capabilities viable for as long as possible.  So it’s good for both troops and taxpayers alike. SCO is focused on thinking differently, which is incredibly important to innovation when it comes to technological capabilities.  Thinking differently put us in space and on the moon.  It put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips.  It’s how we came to have airplanes that take off from the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, and satellite networks that take pictures of the world and show us where we are in it.  And this kind of bold, innovative thinking isn’t lost to history.  It’s happening every day, in SCO and many other places throughout the Department of Defense. Most people don’t often hear about it because most of its work is classified; however, SCO has been a tremendously useful part of DoD.  It’s received large support from all the services, as well as our combatant commands, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and also Congress – with its budget growing from $140 million in its first year, FY 2014, to reaching $845 million for FY 2017 in this year’s budget submission.  To show the return we’re getting on those investments, I’d like to highlight some projects SCO has been working on that we’re funding in the budget. First is a project focused on advanced navigation, where SCO is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads – enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand. Another SCO project uses swarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.  For the air, they’ve developed micro-drones that are really fast, and really resilient – they can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk.  Each one leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the micro-drones use a lot of commercial components and 3D printing.  And the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote for the Mars lander. SCO also has a project on gun-based missile defense, where we’re taking the same hypervelocity smart projectile developed for the electromagnetic railgun, and using it for point defense by firing it with artillery we already have in our inventory – including the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin earlier this year, and we found that it also significantly increases the range. There’s also a SCO project that we’re calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms, and turns it into a flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads.  In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes – essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities. The last SCO project I want to highlight is how we’re creating a brand new capability with the SM-6 missile, an interceptor that’s designed to launch from our Navy’s surface ships and be highly maneuverable and aerodynamic to stop incoming ballistic and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.  It’s one of our most modern and capable munitions – and thanks to work done by SCO, we’ve been able to modify the SM-6 so that in addition to missile defense, it can also target enemy ships at sea.  This new anti-ship mode makes the SM-6 doubly useful, taking the defensive speed and maneuverability already sitting in our Aegis destroyers’ launch cells and leveraging it for offensive surface warfare lethality.  That makes it a potent new capability for our fleet, and also a good deal for the taxpayer by using the same thing twice.  We already know this works; it was fully tested this past January to great success.  And, as I will address later in this testimony, this new operational concept is strongly reflected in our 2017 budget. Those are just a few projects that SCO has worked on so far – and they’re working on a lot more, including some surprising ones. Now, with all of that in mind – from why we need to invest in technological innovation, to how we’re doing it – let me address the specific investments this budget makes in technologies and capabilities to deter, and if necessary fight and win, a full-spectrum conventional war against even the most high-end of adversaries.  In concert, they will help maintain our military’s edge both under and on the sea, on land, in the air, in space, in cyber and electronic warfare, and in the modernization and maintenance of our nuclear enterprise. Maritime Investments In the maritime domain, the budget refocuses our Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts while continuing to grow the battle fleet to meet, but not exceed, the department’s warfighting posture requirement of 308 ships.  Our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years. First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – leveraging and growing our commanding lead in an area where the U.S. military should be doing more, not less, going forward.  It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, including $170.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.5 billion over the FYDP for an improved heavyweight torpedo as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo to stay ahead of existing and emerging undersea challenges.  It includes $5.2 billion in FY 2017 and $29.4 billion over the FYDP to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; four of those submarines – up from three in last year’s budget – will be equipped with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that can more than triple each submarine’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles to 40.  The budget also invests $500 million in FY 2017, and $3.4 billion over the FYDP, to upgrade 49 of our submarines’ combat systems and enhance underwater acoustics on nine of our existing Virginia-class submarines.  It increases funding for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) by over $100 million in FY 2017, part of a total $173 million in FY 2017 and $1.2 billion over the FYDP that invests in, among other areas, rapid prototyping of UUVs in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – which is important, since UUVs can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  And it includes $2.2 billion in FY 2017 and $6.4 billion over the FYDP to continue procuring the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft.   Together, all these investments – totaling $8.2 billion in FY 2017, and $41.9 billion over the next five years – will ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world. Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary prevail in a full-spectrum conflict against even the most advanced adversaries.  It invests $597 million in FY 2017, and $2.9 billion over the FYDP, to maximize production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, procuring 125 in FY 2017 and 625 over the next five years – and this investment is doubly important given the SM-6’s new anti-ship capability.  It also invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads – including $1 billion in FY 2017, and $5.8 billion over the FYDP, for all variants of the SM-3 high-altitude ballistic missile interceptor; $340 million in FY 2017, and $925 million over the FYDP, for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile; $221 million in FY 2017, and $1.4 billion over the FYDP, for the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, including its extended range version; and $435 million in FY 2017, as part of $2.1 billion over the FYDP, for the most advanced variant of the Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which once upgraded can also be used for maritime strike. Third, the budget reflects decisions we’ve made to ensure that we look at our overall warfighting posture, rather than only the presence that contributes to it, in determining whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict.  Having grown the size and the capability of our surface and subsurface fleet over the last seven years, this budget will continue to do both.  It will ensure we meet the department’s 308-ship posture requirement – indeed, growing the battle fleet to 308 ships by the end of the FYDP – and it will make our naval forces as a whole more capable, more survivable, and more lethal than they would have been otherwise. The budget invests $3.4 billion in FY 2017 and $18.3 billion over the FYDP to continue to buy two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 over the FYDP – as well as $400 million in FY 2017 and $2.8 billion over the FYDP for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing $2.7 billion in FY 2017 and $13.5 billion over the FYDP for new construction of Ford-class carriers, as well as $2 billion in FY 2017 and $8.9 billion over the FYDP for midlife reactor refueling and overhauls on our current carrier fleet.  And, as I will discuss in the reform section of this testimony, it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers – providing them with more capability and a longer lifespan while freeing up significant funds that can be put toward a variety of uses. I’d like to now address the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), where we made an important tradeoff so we could put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and many other critical areas.  As such, the budget takes a new approach to the LCS and its associated frigate – buying a total of 40, not the 52 or more that were planned starting back in 2002.  Let me explain why.  First, to be clear, we’re investing in LCS and frigates because we need the capability they provide, and for missions like minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare, they’re expected to be very capable.  But now, in 2016, we have to further balance our shipbuilding investments among guided missile destroyers and Virginia-class attack submarines.  We face competitors who are challenging us on the open ocean with new submarines, ships, aircraft, and missiles – advanced capabilities we haven’t had to contend with in a long time, meaning that we must now invest more in higher-end capabilities across our own fleet.  The department’s warfighting analysis called for 40 small surface combatants, so that’s how many we’re buying.  Over the next 10 years, this will let us invest almost $8 billion more into highly lethal ships and capabilities – all the while increasing both the number of ships and the capability of our battle fleet.  While this will somewhat reduce the number of LCS available for presence operations, that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface, and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries.  Under this rebalanced plan, we will still achieve our 308-ship goal within the next five years, and we will be better positioned as a force to effectively deter, and if necessary defeat, even the most advanced potential adversaries. Land Investments To ensure our ground forces have the capabilities to counter emerging threats and the demonstrated ability to deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict, the budget will help provide our Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces with greater lethality in several forms.  This includes a next-generation shoulder-launched weapon, a life extension program as well as a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can be used for improved counter-battery and long-range strike, and increased firepower for Stryker armored fighting vehicles.  Together these investments comprise $780 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP. Additionally, the budget invests $735 million in FY 2017, and $6.8 billion over the FYDP, in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle intended to replace the military’s Humvees – procuring more than 2,000 vehicles in FY 2017, and a total of more than 17,700 vehicles over the next five years.  It also invests $159 million in FY 2017, and $1.7 billion over the FYDP, in the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which will replace the Marine Corps’ aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle – helping procure over 200 vehicles over the next five years.  And, as I discuss later in the reform section of this testimony, it supports the Army’s ongoing Aviation Restructure Initiative – investing $1.1 billion for 52 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.7 billion for 275 Apaches over the FYDP, as well as $1 billion for 36 UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.6 billion for 268 Black Hawks over the FYDP. The budget also invests $9.1 billion for missile defense in FY 2017, and $47.1 billion over the FYDP.  This reflects important decisions we’ve made to strengthen and improve our missile defense capabilities – particularly to counter the anti-access, area-denial challenge of increasingly precise and increasingly long-range ballistic and cruise missiles being fielded by several nations in multiple regions of the world.  Instead of spending more money on a smaller number of more traditional and expensive interceptors, we’re funding a wide range of defensive capabilities that can defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby impose higher costs on the attacker.  The budget invests in improvements that complicate enemy targeting, harden our bases, and leverage gun-based point defense capabilities – from upgrading the Land-Based Phalanx Weapons System, to developing hypervelocity smart projectiles that as I mentioned earlier can be fired not only from the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, but also the hundreds of Army M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  Additionally, the budget’s missile defense investments maintain DoD’s commitment to improving our homeland and theater defense systems – as we’re increasing the number of deployed Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) from 30 to 44, redesigning the exo-atmospheric kill vehicle to improve the reliability of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, and funding improvements and follow-on concept development for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Specifically, we’re investing $1.2 billion in FY 2017 and $5.8 billion over the FYDP for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program; for THAAD, we’re spending $640 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP, which includes procuring 24 interceptors in FY 2017 and 149 over the FYDP; and, to research, develop, and deploy a new Long-Range Discrimination Radar, we’re investing $317 million in FY 2017 and $1 billion over the FYDP. Air Investments To ensure the U.S. military’s continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in several areas – and not just platforms, but also payloads.  For example, it invests $2.4 billion in FY 2017 and $8 billion over the FYDP in a wide range of versatile munitions – including buying more Small Diameter Bombs, JDAMs, Hellfires, and AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.  We are also developing hypersonics that can fly over five times the speed of sound. The budget continues to buy the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.  It includes $10.1 billion in FY 2017 and $56.3 billion over the FYDP to procure a total of 404 F-35s across the force through 2021 – 43 F-35As for the Air Force in FY 2017 as part of 243 to be purchased over the FYDP, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 97 to be purchased over the FYDP, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 64 to be purchased over the FYDP.  This represents a slight deferral in Air Force F-35 procurement, which we’re doing in order to free up funds to maintain a larger-size Air Force of 55 tactical fighter squadrons, and to improve avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, and B-52 fleets – increasing their lethality, survivability, and therefore usefulness in a full-spectrum conflict.  At the same time, it also represents an increase in the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-35 procurement, which is important to ensure sufficient high-end capability and numbers in our aircraft carriers’ tactical fighter fleet. Additionally, the budget invests $1.4 billion in FY 2017 and $12.1 billion over the FYDP for continued development of the B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as $3.1 billion in FY 2017 and $15.7 billion over the FYDP to continue upgrading our aerial tanker fleet – buying 15 KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers in FY 2017 as part of 75 aircraft to be purchased over the FYDP. The budget also reflects important decisions regarding future unmanned aerial systems, such as the Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), formerly known as the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Air Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program – by focusing in the near-term on providing carrier-based aerial refueling, we’re setting the stage for a future unmanned carrier air wing.  With this approach, the Navy will be able to quickly and affordably field the kinds of unmanned systems that its carrier air wings need today, while laying an important foundation for future, more capable unmanned carrier-based platforms.  We know we need to ensure aircraft can operate off the carrier in high-threat environments, and we’re working hard to make them unmanned – it’s just that the UCLASS program as previously structured was not the fastest path to get us there.  This approach will allow us to get started integrating unmanned aircraft onto our aircraft carriers affordably and as soon as possible. Furthermore, to maximize the capabilities and extend the reach of all our airborne systems, the budget reflects how we’re expanding manned-unmanned teaming – from buying Navy MQ-4C Triton unmanned maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft, which can be paired with our P-8A Poseidon aircraft for a variety of missions; to buying Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that can pair with MQ-1C Gray Eagle scouts; to buying Air Force F-35s that can network with both payloads and platforms. Cyber and Electronic Warfare Investments This budget significantly increases our cyber capabilities, with new investments totaling over $900 million in FY 2017 compared to last year’s budget. Because defending our networks is and must be DoD’s number-one mission in cyberspace, the budget makes significant investments to improve our defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding.  These include $336 million over the FYDP to support more capable network perimeter defenses, as well as $378 million over the FYDP to train and strengthen DoD’s Cyber Protection Teams to respond to security breaches, grow our cyber training and testing ranges, and support tool development that will let our Cyber Mission Force quickly respond to cyberattacks against our networks regardless of where they are stationed around the world. Reflecting our renewed commitment to deterring even the most advanced adversaries, the budget also invests in cyber deterrence capabilities, including building potential military response options.  This effort is focused on our most active cyber aggressors, and is based around core principles of resiliency, denial, and response. As part of DoD’s second cyber mission – defending the nation – the budget invests in an advanced capability to disrupt cyberattacks of significant consequences.  And to support DoD’s third cyber mission – providing offensive cyber options that if directed can augment our other military systems – the budget invests $347 million over the FYDP to help provide cyber tools and support infrastructure for the Cyber Mission Force and U.S. Cyber Command. DoD has a unique level of resources and cyber expertise compared to the rest of the federal government, and following the recent data breaches of the Office of Personnel Management’s information technology systems, DoD has undertaken responsibility for the development, maintenance, and cybersecurity of the replacement background investigation systems and their data infrastructure.  To provide proper support and a dedicated funding stream for this effort, the President’s budget includes $95 million for DoD in FY 2017.  Also, on a separate but related note, the budget invests $454 million over the FYDP to ensure DoD will continue to have access to the trusted microelectronic components needed in our weapon systems.  By developing alternative sources for advanced microchips and trusted designs, this funding will help ensure the long-term security of our systems and capabilities. Meanwhile, to protect our platforms and ensure U.S. freedom of maneuver in contested environments, the budget also continues to support research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of advanced electronic warfare capabilities – totaling $3.7 billion in FY 2017 and $20.5 billion over the FYDP.  To enhance the electronic survivability and lethality of fighter and bomber aircraft like the F/A-18, F-15, and B-2, we’re investing in both offensive and defensive airborne capabilities, including the Air Force’s Defensive Management System modernization and Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, and also the Navy’s Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures and Next Generation Jammer.  We’re upgrading the radar on our E-3 Sentry AWACS with enhanced electronic protection to make adversary jammers less effective.  Investments in the Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program will help our ships protect themselves better.  And to help protect our ground forces, the budget invests in the Army’s Common Infrared Countermeasures and Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, as well as the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger pod. While cyber and electronic warfare capabilities provide, for the most part, different techniques to achieve similar mission objectives, an integrated approach can yield additional benefits.  This is reflected in our budget, including investments intended to ensure we can hold even the most challenging targets at risk. Space Investments As I mentioned earlier, this budget continues and builds upon important investments in last year’s budget to help secure U.S. access to space and address space as an operational domain. After adding over $5 billion in new investments in DoD’s 2016 budget submission to make us better postured for contested military operations in space – including over $2 billion in space control efforts to address potential threats to U.S. space systems – this budget largely sustains those investments over the FYDP.  While there is much more work ahead, we are on a good path in our efforts to complicate an adversary’s ability to defeat our systems while also enhancing our ability to identify, attribute, and negate all threatening actions in space. Meanwhile, the budget also supports strengthening our current space-based capabilities, and maturing our space command and control.  It invests in more satellites for our Space-Based Infrared System to maintain the robust strategic missile warning capability we have today.  And it allocates $108 million over the FYDP to implement the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), which will better align joint operations in space across the U.S. government. DoD must have assured access to space through multiple reliable sources that can launch our critical national security satellites, which is why the budget invests $1.8 billion for space launch in FY 2017 and $9.4 billion over the FYDP.  Because we want to end the use of the foreign RD-180 engine as soon as possible, because we have a strong desire to preserve competition for space launch in order to ensure multiple launch service providers can sustain uninterrupted access to space, and to control costs, the budget includes funds for competitive public-private partnerships to help develop new launch services, which we believe is the most responsible way forward.  Merely developing a new engine would not give us the assured access to space that we require.  We plan to take advantage of the emerging commercial space launch marketplace using an innovative, more commercial approach – investing through competition in new launch services in return for priced options for future launches. Nuclear Enterprise Investments The budget also makes reforms and investments needed to continue providing a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.  Compared to last year’s budget submission, it adds $10 billion over the next five years, for a total of $19 billion in FY 2017 and $108 billion over the FYDP for maintaining, and modernizing the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control, and communications systems.  This reflects DoD’s continuing commitment to the nuclear triad and its critical mission. In addition to making an array of investments across the nuclear enterprise – from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance, to technological efforts that improve the sustainability of our bomber fleet – the budget also fully funds the first stages of our key nuclear modernization effort, in particular the replacement of our Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.  The Ohio Replacement Program is allocated $1.9 billion in FY 2017 and $13.2 billion over the FYDP, which in addition to research and development will allow the first year of construction on an incrementally-funded first ship to begin in FY 2021. We expect the total cost of nuclear modernization to be in the range of $350-$450 billion.  Although this still presents an enormous affordability challenge for DoD, we believe it must be funded.  Previous modernizations of America’s strategic deterrent and nuclear security enterprise were accomplished by topline increases to avoid having to make drastic reductions to conventional forces, and it would be prudent to do so again.  I hope DoD can work with Congress to minimize the risk to our national defense. Building the All-Volunteer Force of the Future While we have the finest fighting force in the world today, that excellence is not a birthright, and we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again, starting with our most enduring advantage – our people. That’s what building the force of the future is all about:  making sure that long into the future, my successors will be able to count on the same excellence in people that I do today.  And we have several overarching priorities to help us do that, like attracting a new generation of talented Americans, promoting diversity, and rewarding merit; carving tunnels through the walls between DoD, the private sector, our reserve force, and other agencies across the government; and updating and modernizing our personnel management systems with technology and data analysis to help improve the choices and decisions we make related to our people. I made this commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school in Abington, Pennsylvania to outline my vision for the force of the future.  I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and labor market changes, we in the Pentagon must try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans.  In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century.  And this past December, I announced that we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force. Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  It’s not a business.  We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows our friends and family members and fellow citizens to go to school, go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give the next generation a better future. The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. Last spring I asked DoD’s Personnel and Readiness chief to lead a team in developing a package of bold proposals, which they did – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and also coming up with some new ideas.  Subsequently, a senior leadership team led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva has been working with the service vice chiefs to closely analyze each proposal and make recommendations before I decide.  While this process is still ongoing for some proposals, I’ve decided to announce my decisions on other proposals as I’ve made them, which I will now detail. Greater Permeability and Talent Management I outlined the first link we’re building to the force of the future at George Washington University last November, announcing over a dozen new initiatives in several categories that are intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent. First, we’re creating what we call ‘on-ramps’ for people who aren’t involved with DoD but want to try contributing to our mission.  One way we’re doing this is by having better managed internship programs that more effectively transition promising interns into employees.  Another is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community for a time to help solve some of our most complex problems.  We’re also going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two.  And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles, as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Second, we’re creating short-term ‘off-ramps’ for those currently in DoD, so they can gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives from outside and then bring them back in to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking.  One way we’re doing this is by expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family.  DoD plans to seek authorities to make this program permanent, and looks forward to working with Congress to do so – similar to how we were able to partner last year to update and modernize retirement benefits and ensure that the 80 percent of our force that doesn’t serve 20 years will get the benefits they earned whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life. And third, we’re going to use 21st century data and technology to improve and modernize our talent management systems.  We’re launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help give servicemembers and units more choice in matching up for future assignments.  We’re creating an Office of People Analytics to leverage big data to inform our personnel policies.  We’re finally implementing exit surveys, so we can have quantitative data on why people decide to leave.  And to help us keep bringing in the best people, we’re looking at ways to evaluate recruit performance, improve outcomes, and better analyze trends that if left unchecked could indicate or lead to our military’s insularity from the rest of society. Family Support and Retention Next, in January, I announced our so-called second link to the force of the future, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life.  They were developed keeping in mind DoD’s recruiting, retention, and career and talent management needs, as well as our closely-linked readiness and warfighting demands, which must always guide us. We know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force – 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages, with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other.  So while we recruit a servicemember, we retain a family.  This means that what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we’re a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit, is absolutely essential to our future strength.  While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known; among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top.  We also know that at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services.  And we know that a high level of work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service. To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work-life balance.  These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly four-in-five of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce – twice the rate of baby boomers.  These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly. That’s why, for starters, we’re providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force – setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, and working with Congress to seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  These changes put DoD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  For both mothers and fathers alike, this establishes the right balance of offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force.  While I don’t take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we’re providing across the joint force.  This will be an increasingly important factor as current and future generations of parents have different views and expectations in parenting, and we must continue to be able to attract and retain the best talent among them. Additionally, we’re expanding the childcare we provide on our bases, because whether for single parents, for families in which both parents work outside the home, or for every mother or father in our military, childcare hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands.  So based on feedback from pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase childcare access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with childcare they can rely on –from before reveille to after taps – we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  And we show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals. We’re also making relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breastfeeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, we’re requiring the installation or modification of mothers’ rooms throughout all facilities when there are more than 50 women regularly assigned. Furthermore, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time preserving our force’s effectiveness.  Data indicates that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active-duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness.  DoD will be seeking legislative authority to this effect – when the needs of the force permit a servicemember to stay at their current location, we will seek to empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation. Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  To account for this more fully in the benefits we provide our troops, DoD will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active-duty servicemembers – a benefit that will help provide our men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers. Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries.  The initiatives approved to date total $867 million across the FYDP; we’ve included this in our budget because it’s a worthy investment that will yield great returns. More Still to Come While these first two links are important, we will have more to announce on the force of the future in the coming months.  For example, we’re taking a serious look at some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system, and I greatly appreciate Congressional leaders from both parties who have indicated their support for such reforms in principle.  We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions.  In both of these efforts, working with Congress will be essential to ensure that our force of the future is as strong as the force of today. Reforming the DoD Enterprise As I’ve said consistently from the moment I became Secretary of Defense, I cannot ask for more taxpayer dollars for defense without being candid about the fact that not every defense dollar is spent as wisely or responsibly as it could be, and also being determined to change that and make our department more accountable.  That’s why reforming the DoD enterprise is so important – from improving how we’re organized so we can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the future security environment, to continuing to improve our acquisition and enterprise-wide business and audit practices, to reducing excess infrastructure and overhead, to modernizing the military healthcare system. Before I address the reforms in this budget submission, it’s important to consider the recent history of defense reform – how DoD has been embarked on a reform path for much of the last seven years, and how we appreciate Congress’s work with us over the last year on acquisition and modernized retirement reforms. Despite what some may think, this administration hasn’t been dragging its feet when it comes to defense reform – the reality has been quite the opposite.  Beginning in 2009, we reduced the number of senior executives and general and flag officers, while working with Congress to trim management headquarters staffs by 20 percent, and move DoD toward auditability.  We’ve done three iterations of the Better Buying Power initiative I established to continuously improve our acquisitions, with Better Buying Power 3.0 incorporated into this budget, and we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time.  And we’ve continually submitted much-needed reforms to strengthen the efficiency and capability of our force – many of which have been continually denied, either in whole or in part, at a cost for both taxpayers and our troops.  This last part poses a real problem, because every dollar Congress denies us in reform is a dollar we can’t invest in security we need to deter and defend against today’s and tomorrow’s threats. Now is the time for action.  DoD will work closely with Congress on any anticipated reform legislation, and we welcome an open and collaborative process.  In the past, legislative reform has proven to be a double-edged sword – sometimes it leads to constructive change, which is good, but other times it just adds to bureaucracy and overhead, even if that was never the intent.  I hope that with the focus on reform we’ve recently been seeing in this and the other defense committees in Congress, we can work together to do reform right.  And we should, because there’s a lot that needs to be accomplished in many areas. Continuously Improving Acquisition DoD has been, and still is, absolutely committed to improving acquisition outcomes.  After five years of implementing our Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives for continuous process improvements in the defense acquisition system, we’re seeing compelling indications of significant improvement in acquisition outcomes – for example, annual growth metrics for contracted costs on our major programs have dropped dramatically from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2011 to a 30-year low of 3.5 percent in 2015, and a much higher percentage of major programs are projecting cost reductions relative to initial baselines than in the past.  While these developments are positive signs, we can and must do more to sustain and where possible accelerate our momentum to keep improving and deliver better military capability while protecting American taxpayers. We need to continue reducing overhead and bureaucracy associated with the acquisition system, making it more agile and having a faster flow of commercial technology into our weapon systems.  DoD is comfortable with the reforms in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act – which included several legislative reforms that DoD proposed last year – and we strongly support the increased role of the service chiefs in acquisition programs, particularly on cost and requirements trade-offs.  Going forward, it’s important that we take the responsible approach to absorb these reforms and see their effects before making additional major changes. DoD also appreciates Congress’s interest in flexibility and agility, because the pace of threat changes and technology development are not compatible with our long cycles of budget submission, authorization, and appropriations.  And DoD will be looking for opportunities to work with Congress to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our acquisition process.  In particular, we would welcome greater flexibility in appropriations or reprogramming to initiate development of urgently needed capabilities.  The flexibility to start a program as soon as a threat is identified would save critical time – as much as two years under current practices – and position both DoD and industry to more quickly initiate development, without a long-term commitment, outside the traditional budget cycle.  This step would represent a ‘free’ two years of lead time to acquiring a new capability. Leaner Business Practices and Reducing Excess Overhead and Infrastructure The budget submission reflects several important efforts to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently, generating savings that would be much better invested in other areas like the fight against ISIL or deterring Russian aggression. Part of this means making more reductions to overhead, and also adopting some commonsense business practices that are long overdue – which in total we expect to help save nearly $8 billion over the next five years.  By better managing the 20 percent management headquarters reductions I mentioned earlier, including delayering and flattening management organizational structures, and also by increasing the reduction to 25 percent, reviewing service contracts, and making business operations and IT more efficient, we expect to save close to $5.9 billion over the FYDP.  And we’re modernizing how we manage our commissaries and military exchanges, to optimize their business practices and respond to the changing needs of their customers.  Unlike commissary and military exchange reforms proposed in previous budgets, this new approach protects the benefits they provide our people while still generating expected savings of about $2 billion over the FYDP. We’re also making real progress on reforming DoD’s myriad systems and business processes to meet our commitment to be audit ready by the beginning of FY 2018.  The three military departments began audits of their budgets for the first time last year, and DoD financial audits currently cover over 75 percent of our total General Fund budgetary resources and just over 90 percent of the current year dollars. In addition, we need to stop spending so much money to hold onto bases we don’t need, and implement a domestic round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2019 as we’re requesting.  While it’s helpful that the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act allowed a study of DoD’s excess infrastructure, the bottom line is that we have more bases in more places than we need, with preliminary analysis indicating that we have over 20 percent excess infrastructure.  To ignore this fact while criticizing DoD for wasteful spending is not only a sin of omission, but also a disservice to America’s taxpayers.  Last year’s Congressional denial forced the BRAC round to slip from 2017 to 2019, further prolonging our ability to harvest savings we greatly need.  By then it will have been 14 years since DoD was allowed to right-size its domestic infrastructure, which any business leader or citizen would think is ridiculous – and they’d be right.  Now is the time to fix it. Reexamining Goldwater-Nichols and Defense Institutional Reform I appreciate that Congress shares my desire to make institutional reform a priority.  The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 was important and had deeply positive results, but after 30 years, it needs updates.  To help formulate DoD’s recommendations to Congress on reviewing Goldwater-Nichols reforms, I asked our Deputy Chief Management Officer last fall to lead a comprehensive review of organizational issues in DoD – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and the military departments – and identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of improvement. This review is currently ongoing, and preliminary internal findings are expected by the end of March to help shape our forthcoming recommendations to Congress.  In addition, and without prejudging any outcomes, I can say our review is examining areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, as in not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability; or where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, as in taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint Staff to support management, planning, and execution across the combatant commands, including for prioritizing military activities and resources across combatant command boundaries, and particularly focused on trans-regional, multi-domain, and multi-functional threats, as well as threats within overlapping time frames; ensuring the Chairman’s ability to provide their best military advice to me and the President, outside the chain of command as conceived of in the law; eliminating unnecessary overlap between OSD and the Joint Staff and between the service secretariats and staffs; better aligning combatant command staffs to their mission; streamlining acquisition requirements and decision-making processes to remove unneeded decision-making layers; having more flexibility in the laws and policies that govern joint duty qualifications; and better aligning the Joint Staff and the combatant commands to produce operational advice and respond to transregional threats. I look forward to the full results of our review, and I hope you will too.  While DoD’s current organization produces sound military advice and operational decisions, it often does so in a needlessly costly and time-consuming manner – leaving plenty of room for organizational improvements that can make us more agile and efficient.  While much is within our existing authority to do, we will work with Congressional committees to frame and seek any needed reforms in statute.  I look forward to working with you. Modernizing and Simplifying the Military Healthcare System DoD greatly appreciates that Congressional leaders have said 2016 will be the year to reform our military healthcare system, TRICARE, after having passed retirement modernization reform in 2015.  As you know, DoD has proposed various ways to reform TRICARE for several years, so we look forward to working very closely with Congress in the year ahead.  The reforms reflected in the budget give beneficiaries more simplicity and choice in how they manage their healthcare, while also incentivizing the much more affordable use of military treatment facilities.  This will not only save money, but also maximize the workload and readiness of our military’s medical force, giving our doctors, nurses, medics, and corpsmen the experience they need to be effective at their mission.  Together this should generate about $548 million in FY 2017 and almost $7 billion over the FYDP that can be better spent in other ways without sacrificing the care of our people.  It’s time to get this done. Making Sure Retirement Reform Works DoD greatly appreciates being able to work closely with Congress last year in reforming the military’s retirement system.  In this year’s budget submission, we are including a few modifications to military retirement reform to help make sure those reforms work in the best possible way for the future strength and success of our military. First, continuation pay should not be an entitlement at 12 years of service, but rather a vitally important force shaping tool.  DoD should have the flexibility to determine if and when to offer this benefit so we can better retain the talent we need the most at any given time. Second, the blended retirement plan that Congress passed last year needs some modifications to avoid having adverse effects on retention – in particular, slightly raising the maximum matching contribution from 4 percent to 5 percent.  To improve retention, we also propose increasing the number of years a servicemember has to serve before matching contributions begin – so instead of beginning them at the start of their third year of service, it would be at the start of their fifth year of service, after their first reenlistment.  DoD looks forward to working with Congress to make these proposals a reality. The Right Force Structure for Current and Future Operations The budget also reflects critical decisions on force structure reforms, all of which are vital to making sure our troops have the capabilities they need for both present and future missions.  While Congress has too often rejected such reforms out of hand, our decisions this year show that when world events and operational demands require the Defense Department to change its plans, it does so.  In turn, Congress must do the same, and recognize that with a set budget and the need to invest in advanced capabilities to strengthen high-end deterrence, it’s time to seriously consider these reforms and stop tying our hands from implementing them. I mentioned earlier that we’re pushing off the A-10’s final retirement until 2022 so we can keep more aircraft that can drop smart bombs on ISIL; in addition to changing when A-10s will be retired, we’re also changing how it will happen.  As 2022 approaches, A-10s will be replaced by F-35s only on a squadron-by-squadron basis as they come online, ensuring that all units have sufficient backfill and that we retain enough aircraft needed to fight today’s conflicts. While some members of Congress may think the Navy’s phased approach for modernizing its guided missile cruisers is just a ploy to quickly retire them, that is incorrect – in fact, retiring them now or anytime soon would be a serious mistake.  Our cruisers are the best ships we have for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and given the anti-ship missiles being developed by other nations, we not only can’t afford to go without them; we also need them to be as modern and capable as possible, and for them to stay in service as long as they can.  The Navy’s plan is still smarter and more affordable than the approach laid out by Congress, saving us $3 billion over the FYDP that we’re putting to good use elsewhere in the budget.  And to make clear that this is not a ploy to quickly retire our cruisers, we will be submitting proposed legislative language that Congress can pass to hold the department to its word. Additionally, the Army is continuing to implement its Aviation Restructure Initiative in accordance with the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act as the Chief of Staff of the Army reviews the recent findings of the National Commission on the Future of the Army.  While we will revisit the Army’s aviation transfer plan when we receive the Chief of Staff of the Army’s report, the Commission’s proposal to keep four Apache battalions in the Army National Guard could cost over $2.4 billion if the Army fully equips all 20 active battalions and keeps all aircraft currently dedicated to its equipment set in South Korea.  By improving the readiness of the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and better leveraging the diverse capabilities Black Hawk helicopters bring to the table for National Guard missions – both here at home, and around the world when called upon as an operational reserve – the Army’s planned Aviation Restructure Initiative is in the best interests of both the Army as well as the taxpayers who support it. The Opportunity of Reform Regardless of how any of our proposed reforms might be initially received, DoD needs Congress to work together with us on a path forward for all of them, because there’s a real opportunity in front of us. With last fall’s budget deal, you showed that cooperation and prudent compromise for the good of our future security and strength was actually possible.  And our reform submissions on things like the A-10, commissaries, and TRICARE reflect the fact we’ve heard Congress’s concerns about past submissions, and made adjustments accordingly. If we don’t lead the way ahead together, both troops and taxpayers alike will be forced to deal with the consequences.  So let’s work together on their behalf.  VI. REQUESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE: THE IMPERATIVE OF WORKING TOGETHER Before concluding, I want to reemphasize the big picture, because this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, and we need your support for it. For a long time, DoD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts – long-term at the expense of the here-and-now.  Thankfully we were able to realize that over the last decade, correct it, and with help from Congress turn our attention to the fights we were in. The difference today is that, while such a singular focus made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won’t work for the world we live in.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges – not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both, and we have to have a budget that supports both.  That means funding a force with the right size, readiness, and capabilities to prevail in today’s conflicts while simultaneously building a force that can prevail in the future – recognizing that future force won’t exist unless we take actions today.  That’s what this budget submission was designed to do, and we need your help to do it. I thank this committee again for overwhelmingly supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget; our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, and we hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest risk we face in DoD is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically in the Congress is averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time. By working together, I am confident we can succeed, because in many ways we already have.  If we think back to those defense investments and decisions that changed the course of our nation’s and our military’s history for the better – and not just in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like jointness and the all-volunteer force – they were all able to benefit our security and our society because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations. That same support for what’s in this budget is essential today to address the security challenges we face and seize the opportunities within our grasp.  We need your support in the decisions that our senior military leaders and I are advocating for.  We need you to work with us, and not tie our hands, when it comes to pursuing smart and critical reforms.  And we need you to provide adequate, stable, predictable resources, as only you can, by coming together as you have before – including, in the coming years, to avert the return of sequestration once again.  As long as you do, I know our national security and national strength will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

"Sept. 7, 2016","Good morning. Thanks very much, Lorrie…old friend.  Thanks very much.  Appreciate those kind words, and all you’re doing to help ensure today’s students – and readers – learn the best of the old lessons of war and strategy as they seek to shape and serve in a new era. I want to thank Dean Woods, who could not be here, and the Blavatnik School for inviting me to return to Oxford to speak with all of you today.  I’ve got a number of friends in the audience I’ll mention shortly. It’s a pleasure to be back in the United Kingdom and back on campus.  That’s because, first of all, the United States has no closer ally, no stronger ally than the United Kingdom, and the world has few finer educational institutions than this one.  For centuries the great and the good have been studying here…and you’ve even been generous enough to let people like me in over the years. As Lorrie mentioned, I was fortunate to be one of them…and I was grateful no one held my Philadelphia accent against me.  Now, you probably know in the United States, speaking with a British accent earns you automatically ten extra points of perceived IQ.  And here it works just the other way around…but everyone treated me very well.  And I had a wonderful time here. I earned a doctoral degree in theoretical physics at St. John’s College under Chris Llewellyn Smith, sitting here today.  Terrific to learn from him, [laughter] as you must know…but I’ll spare you the details.  I studied many other subjects at one of Oxford’s other renowned institutions of higher learning, the Lamb and Flag Pub.  I’m disappointed to say I don’t have time for a visit there today also. That’s because I have to make it back to London in time for a very special event.  Tonight, dozens of defense ministers from around the world will gather for the first-ever UN Peacekeeping Defense Ministerial.  My friend and the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon, my very good friend, my very able friend, is hosting this important event where we will discuss how the world’s militaries can and must do more to end – and, more importantly, prevent – conflicts around the world. Of course, that’s not a new commitment for the United Kingdom.  Like many Americans and many others around the world, I’ve always valued Britain’s – and its people’s – global view.  I saw that as a student here at Oxford.  I’ve seen it in my years working on defense issues for my country, alongside our British allies, who have long played a leadership role – economically, politically, militarily, and morally – around the world.  As it has done so, the UK has helped ensure collective security and prosperity in Europe and many other regions of the world, among many other important contributions to global progress and civilization. And I see the UK’s global view, global influence, global reach – both military and moral – still today…at a time of great change in the world and at a time when the principled international order we’ve built together is being tested in Europe and elsewhere.  Indeed, in the face of Russia’s aggression and coercion, and ISIL’s barbarism – the two topics I’d like to address this morning – the United States and the United Kingdom are continuing to stand together.  And so I’d like to speak with you about the steps our alliance – our special relationship – is taking to continue to standup for the principles and values that have, for decades, made all of us safer, freer, and more prosperous. We’ve been doing so together for the last seven and a half decades.  Because, although the U.S.-UK relationship is rooted in centuries of shared history – including a few contretemps and centuries of tension along the way – our modern alliance has its roots in conversations and meetings held just 75 years ago last month aboard the USS AUGUSTA and HMS PRINCE OF WALES.  In August 1941, on those two ships anchored off the shores of Newfoundland, President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill met for the first time, and together made history. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill’s conversations those days were unique and instructive for us today.  That’s because before World War II was won, before it even seemed likely to be won anytime soon, and before the United States was even in the war, the U.S. and UK – in the Atlantic Charter – identified the eight “certain common principles…on which they base[d] their hopes for a better future for the world,” as they put it.  Those principles included freedom of the seas, the right of people to choose their own government, and the elimination of territorial changes against the wishes of the peoples who live there. We should take a moment to appreciate the wisdom – and the pluck, some might say – of those two great statesmen who had the foresight to make a plan for after the war before they had finalized a plan to win the war.  At the time the Atlantic Charter was issued, the United Kingdom was fighting for its very survival.  And the United States would soon be in the fight as well.  But, as the Charter demonstrated, they also sought – and later fought together – to build a world that would not just be safer, but also better, thanks to those shared principles.  That commitment, and the inherent logic of our partnership is what makes our relationship so special.  We are brought together and we work together not only because of shared interests and values – though they are closely aligned – but also because of a shared belief in, and willingness to take action to promote and defend, the principled international order. That’s why Roosevelt and Churchill met near Newfoundland and worked so closely in the years that followed.  And that’s also why generations of Americans and British, servicemembers and civilians, have served together to deliver on the commitment and principles embodied in that Charter.  Along with our other allies, those men and women – whether they served at the Battle of the Bulge or Bletchley Park, under the seas of the Atlantic or on the sands of North Africa, in the skies over the continent or in battles of the Asia-Pacific – all those places, they together won a world war, and set the stage for the hard work to build a better world around those principles. And together, the United States and the United Kingdom, our militaries, our servicemembers, have realized that opportunity.  Together, during and after the war, we built multilateral institutions like the United Nations and the Bretton Woods system.  We established and led the greatest alliance in history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to deter an aggressive Soviet Union and provide a shield behind which the nations of Europe could rebuild.  During the Cold War, we stood together to confront a global adversary intent on autocracy and dominion – and after we succeeded, we helped bring East and West together again.  We stood together to help make and keep the peace in the Balkans.  We stood and responded together in the face of terror – 15 years ago after 9/11, 11 years ago after the 7/7 bombings, fighting side-by-side during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  And we’ve continued to do so, most recently in the coalition military campaign plan to deliver ISIL a lasting and certain defeat. And because of all we’ve done together, our people, our two nations, and people around the world have benefited over the past 75 years.  And the world has become more prosperous and dynamic as a result.  All that change – economic, political, military, social, and technological; personal and national; regional and global – has produced many opportunities for both our nations, but it has also created challenges and crises as well. Indeed, today’s security environment is dramatically different from that of the last generation, and even the generation before that.  In this new era, the United States and the Department of Defense I lead are contending with five immediate, major, and rapidly evolving challenges.  First, of course, here in Europe, the United States is standing with the United Kingdom and America’s NATO allies and taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression, on that I will say more about in a moment.  We’re managing change in the vital Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but also behaving in some ways that are aggressive and self-isolating, which is not.  In that same region, we are also strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations and threat to our allies, South Korea and other allies.  In the Middle East, especially in and around the Gulf, we’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence, all while standing with America’s friends and allies in the region.  And, of course, in the broader Middle East, as well as elsewhere in the world, the Defense Department is continuing to counter and defeat terrorism – in particular, accelerating the lasting defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it metastasizes.  More on that in a moment as well. Now, thankfully, the United States and its military and Defense Department do not have to respond to these challenges or underwrite global security alone.  President Obama and all Americans are heartened to know that we can continue to count on our allies and alliances, and especially on the United Kingdom, to join us in meeting these challenges and defending the principled world order.  That’s because – even with all the change in the world – the inherent logic of our countries’ special relationship still stands. That was true the day before the Brexit vote, and it is true today after the Brexit vote.  The United States respects the decision of the British people, and we’re committed to continuing to partner together in the months and years ahead.  While I said before the vote that I wished it would go the other way, I’m confident the U.S. and the UK will now focus on the future.  And that’s what I’m doing.  And I’m here this week to work with my counterpart Secretary Fallon, who’s doing the same, to ensure that our countries, and our militaries, are ready to keep standing together and partnering together in the years ahead. That’s important, because the Brexit decision does not change all that we have to do together, whether in response to Russian provocation or ISIL’s threats or anything else.  It does not change the fact that the UK will continue to have a rich relationship with countries across Europe – economically, politically, and militarily.  And it does not change all that the United Kingdom – and particularly its military – all that it is doing, all that it is doing at home and around the world. We see that in the ambitious, forward-looking Strategic Defense and Security Review conducted last year, which has quickly progressed to the implementation phase.  We see it in the coming modernization of the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent, maritime patrol aircraft, and attack helicopters, which make clear the British military will continue to be among the most capable in the world.  And we see it in the British military’s contributions to NATO’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, to the global coalition to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, to our deterrence efforts against Russian aggression, and to leading in NATO, including upholding the alliance-wide commitment – and this is important – to invest 2 percent of GDP in defense. This week’s UN Peacekeeping Ministerial is yet another example of the UK’s continuing leadership in the world.  At a time of crises and change, strengthening UN peacekeeping is vital, and I appreciate Britain’s leadership in pressing for reforms to UN peacekeeping.  And I look forward to discussing that further this evening, when I join Prime Minister May, Secretary Fallon, and other defense ministers for this important ministerial. The United Kingdom’s continued commitment to global leadership comes at a time when the principled international order is being tested.  For, as more nations rise, as some states fail, as some institutions fray, as people seek better lives in other countries and on other continents, some are questioning whether the principled international order can endure and continue to serve us as well in the future. Unfortunately, some in the world are also intent on challenging or even upending that principled order.  I’ll speak about two of these challenges today.  First are states like Russia that are trying to play by their own rules, undercutting the principles that have benefited their own country and the rest of the world.  None of these actors can overturn the international order completely, but they are intent on undermining its cohesion, questioning its effectiveness, and assailing its legitimacy.  And the second type of challenger – who in their own right stand opposed to the principled order – are terrorists like ISIL, who are intent on pursuing a violent ideology, premised on hatred and intolerance, and seeking to thrive on division and suspicion.  They directly target the human values and shared principles that bind the current order. Let me start with the challenge posed by Russia’s coercion and aggression.  Despite the progress that we made together in the aftermath of the Cold War, Russia’s actions in recent years – with its violations of Ukrainian and Georgian territorial integrity, its unprofessional behavior in the air, in space, and in cyber-space, as well as its nuclear saber-rattling – all have demonstrated that Russia has a clear ambition to erode the principled international order that has served the United States, our allies and partners, the international community, and in fact Russia itself. As it does so, Russia appears driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced fear.  Russia wants to be considered, very understandably, as the important world power it is, one of historic importance.  Unfortunately, its tendency is to pursue that goal by undercutting the work and contributions of others rather than by creating or making any positive contributions on its own.  It sows instability rather than cultivating stability.  It lashes out, alleging that it fears for its own viability and future, even though no nation – not the United States, not the United Kingdom – seeks to defeat it or constrain its potential.  Just the opposite; we all have expressed an interest in being able to work more closely with Russia. Now in response to this behavior, the United States is taking a strong and balanced approach to address Russia’s actions and deter Russian aggression against our allies.  We are strengthening our capabilities, our posture, our investments, our plans, and our allies and partners, all the while keeping the door open to working with Russia, wherever and whenever our interests align. Let me be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don’t seek an enemy in Russia.  But also make no mistake – we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us.  We will counter attempts to undermine our collective security.  And we will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes. Now, we haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on the Transatlantic Community’s eastern flank for over 25 years.  Unfortunately, now we do.  That’s why the United States is strengthening our deterrence posture here in Europe.  Our defense budget for the coming year includes significantly more funding for our European Reassurance Initiative – $3.4 billion dollars, more than quadruple what we allocated this last year.  That will allow us to rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team into Europe on a persistent basis, and to preposition a brigade-worth of equipment and warfighting gear to be used by American troops flown into Europe.  And that’s in addition to the two brigades the United States already has stationed in Europe. Meanwhile, NATO, which the United States and the United Kingdom helped establish and build into the greatest alliance in history, has been writing a new playbook for itself.  Here’s what I mean by that: the 20th-century NATO playbook that helped counter the Soviet Union in the Cold War is not a perfect match for today’s Russia challenge.  That’s why NATO’s new playbook takes the lessons of history and leverages our alliance’s strengths in new ways.  Together, we’ve been adapting and innovating to meet new challenges, like countering the cyber and hybrid warfare threats we’re seeing more and more of, integrating our conventional and nuclear deterrence, and adjusting our military posture and presence here in Europe so we can be more agile and quick in responding to new threats. For example, the United States, the UK, and our NATO allies have developed and exercised what we call a Very-High-Readiness Joint Task Force.  It can deploy NATO forces on 48 hours’ notice from multiple locations in Europe to any crisis on alliance territory.  This is a real innovation: one that combines the commitments from many members of the Transatlantic Alliance – the United States, the UK, and others – to respond to crises in Europe’s East, South, or elsewhere.  The UK’s own Allied Rapid Reaction Corps will rotate in to spearhead this task force soon. NATO has also agreed to a persistent Enhanced Forward Presence of four NATO battalions stationed in Allied countries on its eastern flank – one each in Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  This past July at the NATO Summit in Warsaw, the United Kingdom announced that it will lead the battalion in Estonia, and the United States announced that it will lead the battalion in Poland. Additionally, NATO and its members, including the U.S. and UK, are also providing support to partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia, both of which have seen their sovereignty and territorial integrity violated by Russia.  We’re helping them strengthen their capabilities for national defense, to improve their ability to work with NATO, and reform their defense institutions…all important in the face of Russian coercion and aggression. Of course, even as we take these prudent steps to guard against a revisionist and more aggressive Russia, the United States will continue to hold out the possibility that Russia could one day assume the role of a constructive and reliable partner.  In fact, we’ve cooperated with Russia when it’s been in our shared national security interest to do so – even recently, most recently in fact, in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And these past few weeks, America’s Secretary of State, John Kerry, has been tirelessly testing the proposition for a true ceasefire in Syria with his Russian counterpart.  Russia entered the Syrian tragedy saying it wanted to counter terrorism and end the civil war – the source of so much suffering – through a political transition.  But what it has done is very different from what it said. Unfortunately so far, Russia, with its support for the Assad regime, has made the situation in Syria more dangerous, more prolonged, and more violent.  That has contributed to what President Obama this weekend called the “gaps of trust” that exist between our two countries. Nevertheless, our diplomatic team continues to test whether Russia will agree to take, and then actually carry out, the specific steps to attain a true ceasefire, and whether it is in fact willing and able to influence the Syrian regime toward a political transition that ends the civil war.  And today’s news out of Syria is not encouraging. The choice is Russia’s to make…and the consequences will be its responsibility. Of course, there was a time, in the years after the Cold War, when Russia worked with the United States and other nations closely, contributing to the principled international order rather than undermining it.  I know and I remember that personally.  In 1995, for example, I negotiated with Russia’s then-defense minister so that Russia could help NATO bring peace to Bosnia and also to establish a number of cooperative efforts together between the U.S. and Russian militaries.  Both of us then blinking from the bright light of the new potential to work with common purpose rather than previously at cross purposes. And I also worked in a very practical and successful manner with Russian defense officials to help limit the dangers of nuclear proliferation in former Soviet states.  In fact, 20 years ago this summer, I was in the Ukrainian town of Pervomaysk with the Russian defense minister, and his American and Ukrainian counterparts, when the last nuclear weapon rolled out of Ukraine.  The denuclearization of Ukraine was the result of far-sighted American, NATO, Russian, and Ukrainian statesmen dedicated to turning the page of history and making a better world together.  So it can be done.  And someday I hope to see that spirit rekindled. Now, let me turn to the Middle East, where the United States and the United Kingdom face a very different challenge from the one posed by Russia, and that’s ISIL – a barbaric organization intent on harming our citizens, damaging our allies and partners, and trying to shake the principled international order with an ideology that is hateful and cruel to those under its sway. In response, the United Kingdom and the United States are leading a historic coalition to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  We’re fighting that campaign in many different ways, across all domains from air to land to cyberspace, to destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology. As I speak to you today, we’ve entered a decisive phase in our counter-ISIL coalition military campaign.  Thanks to the contributions and sacrifices of our local partners there in the region, and of British, American, and coalition servicemembers, we’ve accelerated the military campaign, we have the momentum firmly on our side, and we are seeking – this year – to put ISIL on a path to the lasting defeat it will surely suffer and richly deserves. Let me remind you briefly of our campaign’s three objectives and our strategic approach that Secretary Fallon played a critical role in shaping. The first objective is to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  ISIL’s safe havens in those countries threaten not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples, but also the security of our own citizens and those of our friends and allies.  The safe havens feed the illusion that there can be an Islamic State based on ISIL’s hateful ideology.  That’s why the sooner we defeat it in Iraq and Syria, the safer America, the United Kingdom, and other countries will be. Our second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world.  That’s because, while defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria is necessary, it’s not sufficient.  We know this cancer can metastasize, and in some cases it already has.  That’s why U.S. and coalition forces are engaged in supporting local forces in operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, in Libya, and elsewhere , and in countering ISIL across the intangible geography and terrain of the Internet. And our third objective, and a very important one, is to support our law enforcement and our intelligence partners, in protecting our respective homelands. All three objectives are critical to defeating ISIL and delivering it the lasting defeat it deserves.  Ensuring that sort of defeat – a lasting one – requires our coalition to identify and enable capable, motivated local forces in Iraq and Syria, and not to attempt to substitute for them.  That is our strategic approach…for local forces are the only ones that can hold and govern territory after it has been retaken from ISIL.  So their participation is necessary to make ISIL’s defeat stick. From my first conversations with Secretary Fallon, we resolved to accelerate our coalition’s military campaign.  We set in motion a series of deliberate steps to gather momentum and put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  And we’ve seen those steps carried out over the last year.  We mobilized the coalition to step up the contributions – not only of the United States and the United Kingdom but of all its members – and get them to join the fight.  And we made it clear that there can be no free riders in this campaign.  When the war is over and the coalition prevails – which I am certain it will – the United States will not forget that the United Kingdom stood with us.  And collectively we will remember who failed to show up for the fight. Since last fall – town after town, from every direction, and in every domain – our campaign has accelerated, pressuring and squeezing ISIL, and rolling it back towards Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. In Iraq, we enabled the Iraqi Security Forces led by Prime Minister Abadi and the Peshmerga commanded by Kurdish Regional President Barzani to clear Ramadi, and Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Makhmour, and now the important town of Qayyarah – setting the stage to complete the envelopment and the isolation of Mosul and collapse ISIL’s control over that city. In Syria, we’ve also enabled considerable results by our local partners.  After seizing Shaddadi – a crucial junction on the road between Mosul and Raqqa and key to cutting ISIL’s self-proclaimed caliphate in two, an Iraqi piece and a Syrian piece – our partners on the ground cleared Manbij City, a key transit point for external plotters, by the way, threatening Europe and our homelands.  And our NATO ally Turkey, working with vetted Syrian opposition forces, is clearing the remaining stretch of the Syrian side of the border from ISIL.  The United States is supporting this effort also through air strikes, surveillance, and other enablers, and – as of last week – with High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.  To be clear, the United States is willing to do more to help Turkey – including on the ground in Syria – to cut off ISIL lines to and from Europe.  At the same time, we will continue to work with and support the Syrian Democratic Forces to capitalize on their considerable successes on the battlefield, especially as they begin to converge on Raqqa – our next objective in Syria. At the same time, across Iraq and Syria, our coalition is pressuring ISIL by systematically eliminating its key leaders and destroying its financial base.  Just last week, our coalition targeted Abu Muhamad Al-Adnani – one of the most lethal leaders within ISIL, who was actively planning to kill our civilians around the world.  Wherever our local partners have advanced we’ve taken out ISIL field commanders.  Thus far, we’ve removed from the battlefield more than 20 external operators and plotters of ISIL, including Jihadi John and Junaid Hussein.  We’re continuing attacks on ISIL’s economic infrastructure – from oil wells and cash storage sites to tanker trucks.  In recent days, our coalition hit over 40 oil tankers and other key ISIL financial centers, depriving ISIL of tens of millions of dollars in revenues.  And we’re taking the fight to ISIL across all domains, including cyber. We’ve also seen results where we’ve been countering ISIL’s metastases.  Working alongside our Afghan partners, U.S. forces have conducted two large operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, dealing the organization severe blows, including killing its top leader there, and degrading its infrastructure, logistics base, and recruiting.  And more operations are coming.  Meanwhile, in Libya – which a few months ago many predicted would become the next ISIL headquarters – our air strikes in support of local forces aligned with the Government of National Accord have shrunk ISIL’s presence in Sirte to a single neighborhood. So as I said, we have entered a decisive phase in our campaign.  Our coalition has expanded our geographic reach, intensified our operations – in the air, on the ground, in cyberspace – and we’ve enabled our local partners to take and hold territory.  ISIL is simply unable to resist this pressure.  They’re still a dangerous adversary and their lasting defeat will take time.  But we won’t let up until ISIL is defeated. Of course, even when the coalition wins this fight – and let there be no doubt that we will – there will still be much more to do.  We must ensure that when that time comes, the Iraqi and Syrian people have what they need to hold, stabilize, and govern their own territory and win back peaceful lives for themselves.  So our coalition’s development and diplomatic institutions must summon the courage and foresight that Roosevelt and Churchill had all those years ago, and make their own plans and preparations to keep a lasting peace once our militaries and our partner forces have delivered that defeat. Russia’s aggression and ISIL’s barbarism are robust challenges for the United States and the United Kingdom, and, to be sure, there are many others out there.  But, if we continue to stand together, if we pursue our objectives with vigor and focus, and if we avoid needless distractions, we not only can meet these challenges, but also seize the many opportunities – many bright opportunities – before us. To do so, as I discussed today – and as I will discuss later this afternoon with Prime Minister May and Secretary Fallon – we must recommit our two countries to standing together and standing up for the values and principled order that we have promoted and defended over the last 75 years.  We must partner together in new ways and in new domains.  And we must remember that our two nations have faced – and overcome – many challenges and many difficult days in the past. At the close of their meetings off Newfoundland, on the quarterdeck of the USS AUGUSTA, Prime Minister Churchill brought out two copies of a poem, a verse of which President Roosevelt had sent him eight months before to help boost the Prime Minister’s spirits in, of course, a very difficult and dark time.  As he said goodbye after their meetings, Churchill signed one part of the poem and gave it to Roosevelt, and asked Roosevelt to do the same. That poem was “The Building of the Ship” by the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  It rather eloquently makes the point that even though a sailor – or by implication a statesman – may worry in the face of storms, rough seas, and tough days, they must sail on for their own good – and the good of everyone on their ship. Now, studying theoretical physics, Chris, I didn’t get many opportunities for me to recite poetry here at Oxford.  But I’ll quote a few lines from that Longfellow poem today.  He wrote: “…Sail on O Ship of State! …In spite of rock and tempest’s roar, In spite of false lights on the shore, Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee...” You see, for decades, the United States and the United Kingdom – and millions of American and British servicemembers – have helped provide the security and uphold the values that have allowed millions upon millions of people around the world to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, and to live lives that are full, and to contribute to the civilization you see all around you in this city At a time of change, and at a time of challenges to what our two nations have both built and defended, we must continue to do so together.  As we do, we must not be afraid of change, or intimidated at the challenge, or doubtful of our capacity to meet it – we must not flinch at the “rock and tempest’s roar” or be distracted by “false lights on the shore.” Instead, we must sail on, and sail on together…for our national and shared interests, for the principles and values embodied in the Atlantic Charter, and for the principled international order that of course has continued to serve us all so well.  As we do, we must remember that… the hearts and the hopes of the world are with us. Thank you.

"May 16, 2017","STAFF:  Good afternoon and welcome to today's swearing-in ceremony in honor of Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force.  Ladies and gentleman, the Secretary of Defense, James M. Mattis, the Secretary of the Air Force, Heather A. Wilson, and General David L. Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force. (Applause.)  (SINGING ""STAR SPANGLED BANNER"")  (Applause.)  STAFF: Ladies and gentleman, General Goldfein.  GENERAL DAVID L. GOLDFEIN:  Secretary Mattis, distinguished guests, fellow joint teammates, family and friends, it is an absolute honor to welcome Dr. Heather Wilson as out 24th Secretary of the Air Force, along with her husband Jay and her son Josh.  Secretary Wilson and I first served together as cadets at the United States Air Force Academy.  Almost 40 years ago, we stood together in the field house and took our oath of office for the first time -- the same oath Dr. Wilson has repeated throughout her distinguished Air Force career, and the same oath she took as she was sworn in as a congresswoman from the great state of New Mexico.  And here we stand together again, as you repeat these same sacred words.  What a journey it has been, and what a journey it will be.  We follow in the footsteps of service secretaries and chiefs of the past who have put their heart and soul into building the most combat-capable and lethal Air Force the world has ever known.  The names are familiar because we studied them together at the academy.  Symington and Spaatz; Orr and Allen; Peters and Ryan; Secretary Wynne, who was here today, and General Moseley; and Donnelly and General Schwartz, who is also with us; and today begins the era of Wilson and Goldfein.  While we face the complex and dangerous national security environment where air and space power are in great demand, others before us have faced similar challenges.  Working together in an executive team, they organized, trained, equipped and presented ready forces to combatant commanders to capture the high ground and win our nation's battles as we simultaneously protected the homeland.  And under your leadership, Madam Secretary, we will do the same.  Of all the words in our sacred oath, perhaps the most important are ""we take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.""  You did not have to take on this responsibility, and no doubt, there were a few nights when you and Jay looked out of your residence at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and questioned why you would leave your dream job to go back into government service.  But, ma'am, your airmen know why.  It's the same reason you left home to join the Air Force in 1978.  It's the same reason you ran for office and served in our Congress.  It's what drives you, because it was ingrained in our character at the Air Force Academy:  integrity first, service before self, excellence in all we do.  Service before self:  ma'am, your nation has called you back to duty, and it is my distinct honor to represent the over 660,000 active-duty Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve and civilian airmen as we welcome you, Jay and Josh back to your Air Force.  We're proud to follow you, and I'm honored to fly on your wing once again, these four decades later.  And it is now my honor to introduce our Secretary of Defense, a man who knows a bit about service and duty, the Honorable James Mattis.  Sir.  (Applause.)  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JIM MATTIS:  Well, thank you, General.  And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here.  General Goldfein, it's great to see the Air Force under your uniform leadership, and to bring you a wing man who knows something about the Air Force, to say the least.  But to Jay and to Josh, thank you for sticking with us through the usual injurious confirmation process.  You've already shown you have the right stuff, just like your mother does, Josh.  And I would just say to Senator Kurtz, Secretary Wynne, Undersecretary Zakheim -- I saw him here -- General Schwartz, General Moseley -- all of you who are here, if we wanted to do one thing to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary to define a patriot with no words, we could put up Heather Wilson's picture right next to the word, and we would explain what a patriot truly is.  And certainly, leaving a dream job somewhere west of the Potomac is something I can identify with.  But I'd just say, on -- on behalf of Secretary Wilson -- and it's lovely to call you that, Secretary Wilson -- on behalf of the entire Air Force community, on behalf of the Department of Defense, welcome home.  Before us, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, is someone whose personal story mirrors America's coming of age and our times.  She's an east-coaster, a Granite Stater who went west to go to college.  She went west to Colorado and came out an Air Force officer from the Air Force Academy and grew up in service to our country.  And it's interesting to look at her service as being at a hinge in history for the Air Force, for our nation and for the world.  She's been at the hinge each time.  She was one of the first women to graduate from the Air Force Academy.  She's one of the first to earn a degree as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford; to serve as a female veteran in Congress.  A cold warrior, she worked in the White House National Security Council when the Berlin wall was swept down.  Infused throughout this service is a continual quest for wisdom, often conducted in exalted institutions, whether in the shadow of the Rockies, on the banks of the Thames, or in the corridors of Congress.  We are grateful recipients today of that expertise.  You know, I read Oxford University books.  Secretary Wilson writes them.  Here's the title of one, and for those of you who don't think Marines can use multi-syllable words, I'm going to prove you wrong.  Title:  ""International Law and the Use of Force by National Liberation Movements.""  How's that for a mouthful?  And how's that for a book that we might all want to be reading right now?  Madam Secretary, I say unequivocally, I need your ideas and this department needs your wisdom.  The Air Force is beginning another chapter in its legendary story.  Secretary Wilson and her airmen will be in -- will have the --  pen.  She masters her subject.  She does not dabble in it.  And writing that history along-side her will be more than a half-million airmen and -women that with ""Fingers"" Goldfein on her wing, the finest Air Force in the world, if we can keep it.  If they wonder what manner of leader they welcome today, I offer the words of a student at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, where Secretary Wilson served several years as president.  And here is the quote:  ""She was much more than a president to us.  She was a role model, a friend to us all, and above all, an inspiration.""  So ladies and gentlemen, our Air Force welcomes a secretary, a scholar, a statesman, an advocate, and one of its own.  It is not surprising that Heather Wilson's service comes at yet another of history's hinges.  Since 1945, American air superiority has never been questioned.  Our Air Force has been so successful that America today takes for granted that our spacious skies are also safe, free and clear.  This is true around the world as America's ground and other combat forces operate with confidence that no evil can set upon them from above.  But history is not pre-determined, nor is it static.  History hangs on a hinge.  Air supremacy is not America's ordained right and there are other hands pushing on history's door.  They push also in space and in cyberspace.  By Secretary Wilson's leadership, by the superior service of America's airmen and -women, they push in vain.  I close with a reflection.  The United States Air Force has an air force today because a pair of bicycle mechanic brothers studied flight day and night and worked like the dickens in a garage in Ohio 100 years ago.  That kind of industry and creativity, the relentless pursuit of knowledge happens all across the world today.  It must happen here.  At an astounding pace, it must happen here.  The U.S. Air Force must be better at it than anyone else.  And under Secretary Wilson, I have absolute total confidence that will be the case.  So summoned once more into service, she will, as we say in the west, she will ride for the brand -- integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.  Secretary Wilson, welcome to the Pentagon. (Applause.)  STAFF:  With Secretary Wilson's family, please join her on the steps for the oath of office.  SEC. MATTIS:  Repeat after me.  I, state your full name...  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HEATHER WILSON: I, Heather Wilson...  SEC. MATTIS:  ... do solemnly swear...  MS. WILSON:  ... do solemnly swear...  SEC.

STAFF:  Ladies and gentlemen, the Honorable Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force. (Applause.)  MS. WILSON:  Thank you, Secretary Mattis, for your leadership and also for your kindness.  I also wanted to thank my husband, Jay, who I think is up for sainthood, and my family, many of whom are here today from all over the country.  General Goldfein, thank you.  It is true, we stood together in 1978 to take that oath the first time.  And we have a lot of other classmates here today, and most of us took our oath four years later, but I think you were on the five-year plan. (Laughter.)  There are several university presidents here who know students like that. (Laughter.)  My colleagues from -- I have several colleagues here from South Dakota, and I wanted to thank you for coming.  And Kevin Schieffer is here from the Board of Regents, as well as two of my colleagues, Tom Jackson, the president of Black Hills State, and my successor, at an exceptional engineering and science university, Jan Puszynski is here from South Dakota Mines; as well as Mike Rush and Jack Warner, who had to put up with me.  They were -- they were technically my supervisor.  I'm a very difficult person to supervise.  General Mattis -- Secretary Mattis, you should have talked to them before you hired me.  My friends and classmates from the class of 1982, thank you for -- (Applause.) -- thank you for your friendship and for your support.  I'll need your advice, because I know you will give it frankly over the next several years.  I also wanted to personally thank Lisa Disbrow, who has been the acting Secretary of the Air Force since January, and she is the undersecretary.  She has served the United States Air Force for 32 years.  And I could not have asked for a better -- better support and help to me and to the country. (Applause.)  And thank you to the airmen who protect the freedoms we enjoy.  You and your family's represent the best of what it means to be an American.  You know, in August 1908, a man names Orville Wright took a contraption made of wood and fabric just over there beyond the corner on Arlington Ridge at the parade ground at Fort Myer.  And he was there a man with a mission, to convince the United States Army that this contraption, this new technology would revolutionize warfare.  And he was right.  As airmen, you are the successors to those bicycle mechanics.  You are the innovators and the intrepid airmen who stand ready every hour of every day on every continent ready to protect the country that we love.  And we've got a lot of work to do.  Under the guidance of Secretary of Defense Mattis and with the support of the United States Congress, we will restore the readiness of the force so that we can win any fight, any time, anywhere.  We're going to cost effectively modernize the force and drive innovation to bring new capabilities to the service of liberty.  And underpinning it all will be a commitment to people, to the development of leaders to command the finest combat force in the world.  We're not going to take for granted American dominance in air and space power.  We're going to use every taxpayer dollar entrusted to us to train for it, to equip for it and to fight for it.  My classmates will remember that small book of knowledge that cadets had to memorize all those years ago.  It was called Contrails.  And every service academy graduate has a copy, usually tattered in the bottom of some box in the garage.  And there are things from it each of us likely remember.  And each of us probably have something different that we remember from that book.  But for me, one that resonates over the years is probably appropriate for this time and this place down the hill from the home of Robert E. Lee, his historic home that now is at Arlington.  Lee said, ""Duty then is the sublimest word in the English language.  You should do your duty in all things.  You can never do more.  You should never wish to do less.""  I know as airmen you will do your duty.  I will do my best to do my duty by all of you.  God bless you all.  And God bless the country that we love. (Applause.)  STAFF:  Thank you, Secretary Wilson.  Ladies and gentleman, please join us singing the Air Force song.  -END- ",Remarks by Secretary Mattis at Swearing-In Ceremony for Secretary of the Air Force Wilson,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1184792/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-swearing-in-ceremony-for-secretary-of-the-air-fo/
"Aug. 22, 2017","Good afternoon, everybody, it’s good to see you again.  I’m honored to be joined today by Mr. Brett McGurk, Presidential Envoy to the Defeat-ISIS Coalition, and Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, our field commander.  We continue to stand steadfast with our Iraqi allies.  Three years ago, Prime Minister Abadi came into a terrible situation.  Today, by his steady hand and strong leadership, and thanks to the Iraqi Security Force and coalition working hand-in-hand, security for the Iraqi people has greatly improved, cities have been liberated, the economy is recovering, Iraq is re-engaging with the region, and ISIS is clearly on the run – and shown to be unable to stand up to our team.  We are dedicated to the Strategic Framework Agreement, and we will continue standing by the Iraqi people and their military to make a brighter future, improve stability, and secure the borders while encouraging regional commerce.  We in the coalition will remain steadfast with Iraqi allies to defeat ISIS and avoid obstacles to our cooperation.  Lieutenant General Townsend will share more with you about the campaign to deal ISIS a lasting defeat.

"March 22, 2016","Thank you very much, Chairman Thornberry. Congresswoman Davis, thank you. Thanks to all Members of the Committee. Thanks for hosting me here today. I want to begin by condemning this morning’s bombings in Belgium.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with those affected by this tragedy – the victims, their families, and the survivors.  And in the face of these acts of terrorism, the United States stands in strong solidarity with our ally Belgium. We’re continuing to monitor the situation, including to ensure that all U.S. personnel and citizens are accounted for.  We also stand ready to provide assistance to our friends and allies in Europe as necessary. Brussels is an international city that has been host to NATO and to the European Union for decades.  Together, we must and we will continue to do everything we can to protect our homelands and defeat terrorists wherever they threaten us.  No attack will affect our resolve to accelerate the defeat of ISIL.  I’ll have more to say about this later in the testimony. Thank you again for hosting me today, and for steadfastly supporting DoD’s men and women all over the world – military and civilian – who serve and defend us.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford and Under Secretary McCord to discuss President Obama’s 2017 defense budget, which marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense.  As I will describe in detail, the threat from terrorism is one of the five challenges, as has been noted, that the United States now faces and will in the future. In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much-needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to help pass it.  That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future. Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world, as we have been since the end of World War II.  That’s thanks in large part to the unequivocal strength of the U.S. military.  And as we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget. I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL – which, as the attacks in Belgium today again remind us, we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing.  And all the while, we’re continuing to help protect our own homeland. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we’re doing to pressure and destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  In Iraq, with our support, the Iraqi Security Forces retook Ramadi, and are now reclaiming further ground in Anbar Province, and are simultaneously shifting the weight of their effort toward Mosul in the north.  With our advice and assistance, Iraqi and Kurdish Security Forces have begun the shaping and isolation phase of the operation to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul.  That was the mission Marine Staff Sergeant Louis Cardin was supporting when he gave his life over the weekend – providing critical protection to Iraqi forces and coalition military advisors in northern Iraq.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and with the other Marines injured in Saturday’s rocket attack.  Their sacrifice will not be forgotten, and our global coalition will complete the mission they were supporting. In Syria, capable and motivated local forces supported by the United States and our global coalition have retaken the east Syrian town of Shaddadi.  This town served as an important logistical and financial hub for ISIL and a key intersection between its Syria and Iraq operations.  In fact, Shaddadi was so important to ISIL that its so-called Minister of War was involved in ISIL’s defense of the town.  We killed him, while our local partners expelled ISIL from the town.  In doing so, the coalition campaign severed the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq.  And we’re intent on further isolating and pressuring ISIL, including by cutting off its remaining lines of communications in southern Syria and into Turkey. In addition to local forces we’re working with, 90 percent of our military coalition partners – from Europe, the Gulf, Asia; 26 countries in all, including, by the way, our ally Belgium – have committed to increase their contributions to help accelerate the defeat of ISIL.  We’ve increased strikes on ISIL-held cash depots, oil revenues, and sites associated with its ambitions to develop and use chemical weapons.  And we’re addressing ISIL’s metastasis as well, having conducted targeted strikes against ISIL in Libya and Afghanistan. As we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding for 2017, as the Chairman already noted – requesting 50 percent more than last year. Now, before I continue, I want to say a few words about Russia’s role in this.  Russia said it was coming into Syria to fight ISIL, but that’s not what it did.  Instead, their military has only prolonged the civil war, propped up Assad, and as of now, we haven’t seen whether Russia has retained leverage over Assad to facilitate a diplomatic way forward, which is what the Syrian people need. One thing is clear, though.  Russia’s entry into Syria didn’t impact our campaign against ISIL.  Along with our coalition partners, we’re intensifying our campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, and we’ll continue to do so until ISIL is dealt a lasting defeat. Two of the other four challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great superpower competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for nearly a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance to the region to maintain the stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, enabling so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our regional friends and allies, especially Israel, to which we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Now, addressing all of these five challenges requires new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, we know we must deal with these challenges across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also especially in cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also led to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit. Key to our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to ensure that anyone who starts a conflict with us will regret doing so.  In our budget, our capabilities, our readiness, and our actions, we must and will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We see them in the South China Sea, and in Crimea and in Syria as well.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting. In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us better address these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces very important matter, emphasized, very appropriately, by the Chairman – and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts.  In our Navy, we’re emphasizing not just increasing the number of ships, which we’re doing, but especially their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships, and extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will keep ensuring our dominance in all domains. As we do this, our budget also seizes opportunities for the future.  That’s a responsibility I have to all my successors – to ensure the military and the Defense Department they inherit is just as strong, if not stronger, than the one I have the privilege of leading today. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, innovating operationally, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – as we always have, to stay ahead of future threats.  That’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent.  Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to meeting it. And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise, and we need your help with all of them – from further reducing overhead and excess infrastructure, to modernizing and simplifying TRICARE, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization, as I intend to do shortly, to continuously improving acquisitions. And on that subject, I want to commend this committee, and especially its leaders, for your continued dedication and strong partnership with DoD on acquisition reform.  We’ve already taken important strides here, such as last year’s reforms to reduce redundant reporting requirements and documentation.  And as you’re looking to do more, so are we. Chairman Thornberry, I know you laid out new proposals on this last week.  Some of what you’re proposing would save us critical time in staying ahead of emerging threats.  That’s very important and we appreciate that.  It’s extremely helpful.  I know this is just a draft, and I appreciate that you put it out there for discussion.  In that regard, I have to say that in the current draft, there are some things that are problematic for us.  So I’m also hopeful that we can continue to work with you on your proposals to ensure that DoD has the flexibility needed to apply the principles in your work to addressing all the diverse acquisition challenges we have to solve for our warfighters.  I appreciate your willingness to hear our ideas as well – including ways to make it easier for program managers to do their jobs, and involving the service chiefs more in acquisition decision-making and accountability – and I look forward to working together as we have before. Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  The Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between fights – between future fights and current fights – we have to do it all.  That’s what this budget is designed to do – and we need your help to succeed. I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, making changes that are necessary and consequential.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we indicated last year we would be asking for and what the budget deal gave us – a net total of about $11 billion less is provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act out of a total of almost $600 billion – but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal; it gave us stability.  We’re grateful for that.  Our greatest risk, DoD’s greatest risk, is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester return in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest budget priority for us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration – to prevent what would be $100 billion in looming automatic cuts – so that we can maintain stability and sustain all these critical investments I’ve been speaking of. We’ve seen this before, and that same support, coming together, is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

"Aug. 14, 2015","Secretary McHugh, my admired friend and public servant, thank you for hosting today’s ceremony. It’s a privilege for me to be here today to honor these two great Americans and their families. Thank you also to the large and distinguished audience that came here to recognize Ray Odierno and what he's meant in connecting our Army to all walks of life. And thank you to the magnificent representatives of our force who stand proud before us all. On his first day as the 38th Army Chief of Staff, General Odierno shared with his soldiers a creed that defines his life and his duty: “The strength of our Nation,” he said, “is our Army; the strength of our Army is our soldiers; the strength of our soldiers is our families. That is what makes us Army Strong.” I join everyone here today in celebrating Ray Odierno’s 39 years of unwavering commitment to Army, to soldier, and to family. Let me start there, with Ray’s family. Linda, you’ve stuck by Ray’s side since high school and you’ve given your life to the Army. You’re a source of comfort for Army families, a source of leadership in military communities, and a source of healing for wounded warriors and their loved ones. To the entire Odierno family – Linda, Tony, Katie, and Mike – we cannot thank you enough for your service to our nation and your support for Ray. Ray’s legacy is like Ray himself: it simply won’t fit into the space behind a podium. But let me characterize it this way: Ray Odierno’s story is our Army’s story. He’s a consummate leader and more, the very symbol of the U.S. Army; big, strong, capable, always willing. After 9/11, under the weight our Army’s mission – as important, difficult, unprecedented, and all-consuming as it was – our soldiers performed exceptionally, with courage and strength befitting the most highly trained and professional land power on earth. No other force – no other force – could have executed or adapted the way our Army did in Iraq and Afghanistan. For that, we are all so proud, and so deeply in its debt. As a leader, in over 50 months in Iraq, Ray’s tenacity helped us get through the most heated period of conflict; his operational savvy helped us surmount the insurgency; his commanding presence calmed the confused; and his courage and compassion helped carry the burden of loss and sacrifice. I and my predecessors as Secretary of Defense and their Commanders in Chief drew great confidence knowing Ray was on the ground leading our political and military work in those heroic and trying times. Ray embodies, as if a symbol, Army Strong. Ray’s a big guy; but even bigger is his personality, his passion, and his heart. He devotes so much time to mentoring young leaders, not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because he loves it. And his soldiers love him back. Ray is just as likely to give you a bear hug as he is to give a sturdy hand shake. He speaks to you with his shoulders always forward, eyes always clear, arguments always sharp – each one buttressed by an unyielding commitment to his mission and his people. Whether listening intently to a grieving family, or looking a foreign leader in the eye to deliver the honest truth, or shaving Stephen Colbert’s head in front of hundreds of soldiers – Ray lives his life, as his Ivy Division motto goes, steadfast and loyal. Each service gives our military unique and unrivaled capabilities. Our planes fly high, our ships sail far, our Marines act quickly - but it's our soldiers who are unmatched in their ability to seize and dominate physical terrain and human terrain. They help give our military, and our nation, an overwhelming edge in defending our people and making a better world for our children. America maintains that edge today, forged in two long wars, sharpened in counter-terror efforts around the world, and leading what must what forever be a free world. We must not take that for granted, we must keep honing that edge into the future. As the world changes, we must change with it. To stay unrivaled in posture. Agile and ready. And Army Strong. That charge now falls to General Mark Milley, our 39th Army Chief of Staff. He’s the right officer to lead the Army over the next four years – to shape our force, to continue restoring its readiness, to get there quickly and win…as our nation expects of its Army. Mark is a leader, a warrior, and a statesman. One story: as it happened, I was with Mark in Afghanistan as the U.S. Consulate in Herat was attacked in 2013, and as we flew there I saw him take decisive command of the scene. In addition to decades of such operational experience, Mark clearly also has the strategic vision needed to build on what Ray’s started. I have confidence – I know – he’ll succeed. Because Mark carries that same, unyielding commitment to Army, to soldier, and to family; and in his case, he carries something Ray Odierno doesn’t have but we both share – a commitment to the Boston Red Sox, too. I want to also thank Hollyanne for her leadership and service, as yet another admired military spouse. To the Milley family, thank you for supporting Mark and for assuming this new post with him. To General Odierno, General Milley, and both your families: for your distinguished leadership, your selfless service, and your belief that above all our people and our principles make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known – your country will be forever grateful. Thank you. ",Army Chief of Staff Change of Responsibility,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/613676/army-chief-of-staff-change-of-responsibility/
"July 21, 2016","Well, good morning, everyone. And thank you, John. Thank you for that very comprehensive and forward-looking and absolutely on target depiction of the threat we face but also the problem that's represented in this room and the certainty of victory. It’s great to join so many friends and colleagues here today, allies and partners. I know Jim Clapper was here earlier this morning for a briefing.  Jim, I want to thank you for your hard work and leadership here. And I particularly want to thank John Kerry for that introduction, that wonderful speech, for hosting us today, and for all his work to counter ISIL and to end the civil war in Syria. I can ask for no better partner in government, John.  And, at a critical time in the world, the United States – and all our allies and partners – can ask for no finer, more dedicated, or more tireless a diplomat than you. Now, while we’ve held Counter-ISIL defense minister meetings before – including yesterday’s very productive meeting at Joint Base Andrews – today’s discussion is the first we’ve held together with our diplomatic and civilian counterparts.  That’s important, because we know that defeating ISIL is more than a one-country, a one-military, or a one-ministry job.  We all have work to do, and we all have to work together. And this is a critically important time for our counter-ISIL campaign.  Thanks to our global coalition, our clear and deliberate military campaign plan, our dedicated local partner forces, and the hard work and sacrifices of our countries’ military personnel, we now have momentum in this fight and clear results on the ground.  And this week, we’re making the further plans and the further commitments that will help us deliver to ISIL the lasting defeat that it deserves.  Together, we’re going to destroy the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology. This morning, I’d like to briefly review our coalition military campaign and our very productive discussion we had yesterday. Our coalition’s military campaign plan has three objectives.  First, to destroy the parent tumor of ISIL in Iraq and Syria.  As recent attacks remind us, ISIL’s safe havens threaten not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples, but also the security of our own citizens.  And the sooner we defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria, the safer our countries will be.  But while it’s necessary to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria, it is not sufficient since this cancer can and in some cases – Afghanistan and Libya, for example – it has metastasized not to mention intangible geography and terrain of the Internet So our second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around the world.  And the third objective, a very important one , is to support, which we do as defense ministers, our national governments’ efforts – diplomatic, economic, homeland and border security, intelligence, law enforcement – to protect our homelands and our people.  All three of these objectives are necessary. In January this year, we updated our comprehensive Coalition Military Campaign Plan to meet those three objectives.  Our campaign’s strategic approach is to identify and enable capable and motivated local forces who can deliver ISIL a lasting defeat with our strong, mighty support.  Only local forces can deliver and sustain such a defeat.  U.S. and coalition forces can enable them with our vast military power, but it’s local forces who must hold and govern territory after it has been retaken from ISIL and restore a decent life to the people who live there. Now, over the last year, we’ve pursued a number of deliberate decisions and actions to accelerate this Coalition Military Campaign Plan and hasten ISIL’s lasting defeat.  A year ago, we put our campaign in its entirety in Iraq and Syria under one single command, charging Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland as the overall operational commander.  Then we introduced a series of accelerants to help us gather momentum.  And, of course, we asked all our coalition countries to make additional contributions to the campaign – which they did, which you did. As we did so, we also set in motion a series of specific and deliberate steps through the winter, the spring, and now the summer – the first plays of the game, as President Obama called them.  And since then – play by play, town after town, from every direction and in every domain – our campaign has accelerated further, squeezing ISIL and rolling it back towards Raqqa and Mosul.  By isolating those two cities, we’re effectively setting the stage to collapse ISIL’s control over them. We see that on the ground.  In Iraq, as I saw firsthand during my visit last week, we’re enabling the dedicated Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga led by Prime Minister Abadi and supported by Kurdish Regional President Barzani.  And after clearing Ramadi and establishing a staging base in Makhmur, the Iraqi Security Forces moved on to liberate Hit, Rutbah, and Fallujah.  Then early last week, they seized the strategically important Qayyarah West airfield, which is a critical logistical springboard for the effort to collapse ISIL’s control of Mosul. And in Syria, we’re also seeing results.  After seizing Shaddadi – a crucial junction on the road between Mosul and Raqqa – our partners on the ground have now surrounded Manbij City, which is one of the last junctions connecting Raqqa to the outside world and a key transit point for external plotters threatening our homelands. We’ve also been pressuring ISIL by systematically eliminating their key leaders and their financial base.  In addition to taking out key ISIL ministers and capturing one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, we’ve killed over 20 of ISIL’s external operators who were actively plotting to attack our personnel and our homelands.  And wherever our local partners have moved – whether in Anbar, Ninewah, or Manbij – we have taken out ISIL’s field commanders.  Meanwhile, we’re continuing attacks on ISIL’s economic infrastructure – from oil wells and trucks to cash storage sites.  And we’re taking the fight to ISIL across all domains, including cyber. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of our local partners and our servicemembers, and additional contributions from the nations all around this room, we’ve seized opportunities, reinforced success, and taken the fight to the enemy.  But we are not going to rest. Yesterday, we also reviewed – and agreed on – the next plays in our campaign, which, of course, we’re  not going to discuss publically yet.  But let me be clear: they culminate in the collapse of ISIL’s control over cities of Mosul and Raqqa. Next, we identified the capabilities and support required to execute those next plays.  Since our first full defense ministerial in Brussels in February, our nations, including the United States thanks to President Obama, have provided even more support to accelerate the campaign, as our local partners have made advances in the theater. But we’re all going to need to do more.  The United States, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, Finland, and several others have recently committed – some as recent as yesterday – to contribute even more to the military campaign.  It’s encouraging to see so many countries continue to be willing to do more. And there are others as well, who will make their contributions public in due course. Of course, even when we win this fight – and let there be no doubt that we will – there’ll still be much more to be done.  There will be towns to rebuild, there will be services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Such progress is critical to ensuring ISIL once defeated, stays defeated.  And so, we must ensure that when that time comes, the Iraqi and Syrian people have what they need to hold, stabilize, and govern their own territory. For that reason, we cannot – let me repeat that – we cannot allow the coalition’s stabilization and governance efforts to lag behind our military progress.  That was one of the biggest strategic concerns voiced at yesterday’s defense ministerial, and it will surely be discussed again here today. And that’s a good thing…because making sure there’s no such lag must be a strategic priority.  For that reason, I commend John, his team, and many of your countries’ civilian and diplomatic agencies for the work you are doing to enhance stabilization and governance efforts, including raising more than $2 billion dollars at yesterday’s pledging conference to assist Iraq with humanitarian aid, de-mining, immediate stabilization, and longer-term recovery. Of course, as I said earlier, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient.  That’s why, yesterday, we also discussed how we can continue to combat ISIL wherever it might attempt to take hold, and how our military campaign can best support our national governments’ efforts to protect our respective homelands and our people. Let me close by saying thank you to all of you in the room, my partners, friends for your commitment to this fight, and for your work in the counter-ISIL campaign and at our conferences this week.  I look forward to the conversations today – and to the commitments our nations will be making – to ensure that together, together we will deliver ISIL the lasting defeat it deserves.

"Oct. 3, 2016","I can do all that, too.  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  What a terrific video and no, I can’t do any of that.  But what a great opportunity for all of us to celebrate as a community. Every four years, the country comes together, cheers together, and watches with pride as Team USA enters the Olympic Opening Ceremony in the – in the Parade of Nations.  American athletes – dressed in red, white, and blue – march behind the flag, stand with their foreign counterparts and competitors, and wave to their family and friends in the stands…and all of us here back home. But parades like that are nothing new for a few of the Olympians and Paralympians who competed in Rio this past summer.  And that’s because nearly two dozen athletes and coaches also serve in another uniform…as members of Team DoD.  And while they may be accustomed to marching with a bit more military order here…these individuals bring the same dedication, hard work, and skill to their athletic endeavors that they bring to the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And for that I couldn’t be prouder…or cheer louder. Secretary Fanning, General Harris, John Register from the U.S. Olympic Committee, DoD leaders, colleagues, family and friends, thanks everyone for being here. Let’s give a warm welcome to our Olympic and Paralympic athletes who join us today.  Don’t they look magnificent? As a community and as Team DoD, we support one another in all of our endeavors.  So it’s a pleasure to honor these Olympians and Paralympians for their athletic success, and thank them also for what they do in uniform…athletic and military uniforms, in other words. This year in Rio, Team DoD was represented by 16 Olympians, four Paralympians, and three coaches – warrior-athletes who competed from each of our services.  Many of them join us here today, including Army’s Sergeant First Class Glenn Eller who made his fifth Olympic appearance.  First Lieutenant Cale Simmons proudly represented the Air Force as a pole vaulter – that I definitely can’t do.  Second Lieutenant David Higgins, who shot in the prone rifle event, will start the Marine Corps’ Basic School this fall. And Navy’s Midshipman Fourth Class Regine Tugade was the first Naval Academy plebe to compete.  And these are just a few of the athletes we’re honoring today – you saw the rest in that video a moment ago. Glenn, Cale, David, Regine, and all the other members of Team DoD ran, shot, coached, swam, and more in Rio.  They won four medals.  And one member of Team DoD and Team USA – Army Sergeant Elizabeth Marks – even broke a world record, winning the gold in her Paralympic debut.  Let’s give her and all of them another big round of applause. Team DoD also contributed a few of the moments that make each Olympics special.  You just saw one in the video…how Second Lieutenant and pole vaulter Sam Kendricks was sprinting toward the crossbar and suddenly broke stride to stand at attention as our national anthem played elsewhere in the stadium.  [applause]. With that simple act, he made us proud.  And when he later won the bronze medal, he made us all cheer as well. But in doing so, Sam, also reminded – Sam also reminded everyone watching that these Olympians, Paralympians, and coaches never stop being members of Team DoD – never stop. While there are some similarities in these endeavors – Olympians and Team DoD both wear uniforms, and athletes and servicemembers alike are known for training, training, and training some more – I know it isn’t always easy for them to balance both of those commitments. And that’s why I’m pleased to see so many of you benefited from the support of our initiatives in DoD like the Army’s World Class Athlete Program. And I’m glad all of you were able to make that balance work – to compete in the Games and to serve in uniform – for a few reasons. First, each of you – each and every one of you – is doing one of the noblest things a person can do with their life, which is to help defend our great country and make a better world for our children.  Now, I know some of you are just beginning your military careers – either at a service academy, or in your first or second assignment – while some of you have served around the world…in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.  But each of you makes our country stronger and safer every day.  Thank you for doing so. And second, at a time when we have fewer Americans serving, and fewer who are personally connected to those who serve on our behalf, you help us build bridges.  By competing for Team USA while you serve on Team DoD, you help us connect with our fellow citizens and communities who aren’t as connected as they once were to those who serve and sacrifice on their behalf. And third, as you do all of this – as you compete for gold and serve in uniform, as you protect our country and build these bridges – you inspire all of us.  Look at all those who came out here today to cheer you…this beautiful day in the courtyard at the Pentagon. You inspire them – you inspire all of us to do our best…whether we’re here at the Pentagon, or at bases around the country, or on battlefields thousands of miles away. And you also make me proud – very proud.  Our people, all our people, are my number-one commitment as Secretary of Defense.  I want you to know that I’m immensely proud of everything that all of you have accomplished, and everything you will accomplish…in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, in our military, and long into the future.  And I’ll be cheering for you, and supporting you, all the way. Bless you all, and congratulations.

"June 30, 2017","Thank you, my comrades.  Thank all of you for being here. Although it’s such a pleasure, I don’t need any thanks for coming out to this beautiful ceremony. Believe it or not, the first time I saw this parade was in July of 1969, 48 years ago. I was 18 years old and we were sitting down there, down at the far end.  I was an officer candidate at the time.  We were all bussed up here, told to sit down and shut up, which we did.  And its proof because the parade has not changed one iota, as the Marine Corps has over two hundred years of tradition unhampered by progress. But I say so proudly, because the kind of things that make this America what it is, is not only its power of inspiration, but it’s willingness to defend itself in an awesome manner. I remember a young corporal got up in front of us before the parade. He had a purple medal on—they were all Vietnam Veterans in those days, with purple hearts; and he told us “for you all,” he said, “the only reason you exist is to fight and to fight well and protect this country.” He went on to say, “if you can’t do small things perfectly, you can’t do the big things even half way good enough.”  So tonight you’re going to watch people committed to excellence. And as they march by tonight, look into their eyes and you’ll see this unapologetic pride in who they are and that’s the willingness to go into harm’s way. Remember, these are all volunteers who looked passed the hot political rhetoric of today and rallied to the flag. Then they volunteered for a second thing, the infantry where we take 85 percent of our casualties and these young men are not naïve.  They’ve seen war on TV their whole life growing up. So it’s with great pride that I return to the Barracks. I once hosted here, I think it was 12 years ago, this day as a matter of fact—a parade for John Glenn, Col John Glenn.  And I was floored by it. My boss, Rudy DeLeon who is here tonight, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, when I worked for him, had introduced us. John Glenn and I were standing over in the shadows, after the guests were seated, getting ready to do our thing.  John Glenn was reminiscing about how he had been a Marine for 23 years.  Think about it. He was a Marine fighter pilot in World War II and in Korea, an ace. The first American to orbit the earth. A Senator. And he said, you know 23 years wasn't nearly long enough. I recalled his wing man in Korea was baseball legend Ted Williams.  Ted Williams was once asked by Sports Illustrated, years after he retired, which team that he had been with was the best team ever.  He said, “oh that easy, the U.S. Marine Corp.”  That’s from Ted Williams. And I bring that up because it shows the continuity of what’s passed on from one Marine to another. So it’s not a night for long speeches.  I’m honored to be here Commandant, Colonel. Thank you for having me here.  Let’s have a great evening together and remind ourselves how fortunate we are to be in this country. And Pam Hester out in the audience, a reporter with the guts to go into Fallujah with the Marines, thank you, wherever you’re at Pam. Let’s have a great evening and Happy Fourth of July.

"May 29, 2017","They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.*  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford, Gold Star families, everyone.  We gather here today with a shared attitude of gratitude.  Twenty-Three centuries ago, so Plutarch tell us, an old Spartan King observed, it is not the places that grace men but men grace the places.  Today we know that he was right.  More than a century ago, this 624-acre plot of land was a plantation on the Potomac. Scenic, but hardly sacred. Now, these fields hold the greatest treasure of our nation. America’s courageous, dead. Those who today we pause to remember.  Not far from here lies the marker of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a Civil War infantry veteran, who later rose to be a Supreme Court justice. Holmes said those who serve in our military have hearts that are “touched with fire. Having known great things,” he said, they are “content with silence.”  If you have ever known one of the fallen, you have known greatness. But it is hard to be content with their silence, for we miss them. The empty chair on a holiday, empty every day. The photograph that goes wherever you do. The picture fades, but the person in it does not.  Their fighting spirit persists, passed down through the ranks, their spirit echoes in those who serve today in the air, on land, and at sea.  In a world awash with change, some things stand firm. Some things are as Plato said: Good and true and beautiful.  The kid on the line who never got a chance to grow old will always be there to teach us that suffering has meaning if it is accepted out of love for others.  To the families of the fallen, both here and at home, no words will ease your pain. But I beg you, let it have meaning. Unite your sorrow to their awesome purpose. People do grace places, but people also grace people. We are blessed by our time with those now asleep, the mighty and the gentle.  Let us share their story with others. Then, like the poet**, we all can say:  Sleep, soldiers! still in honored rest, Your truth and valor wearing. The bravest are the tenderest,– The loving are the daring.

Thanks, thanks for that introduction. And thanks, General Holland also for welcoming me here today.  Appreciate it, General.  And to all of you, to all of you, first of all, thank you.  Thank you for joining our family, our mission.  The profession that you represent – you’re doing with your lives the noblest thing that you can do, which is to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  That’s why you’re here, that’s why I’m here.  That’s why everyone in our magnificent Department of Defense is there.  Because we wake up every morning with that mission in mind.  And it feels good.  It feels good to be part of something bigger than yourself.  And it’s hard work, but it’s the most important and noble thing you can be doing with your lives.  I want you to know that you should be proud of yourselves, and I as the Secretary of Defense am incredibly proud of you.  I can’t tell you what it’s like to be able to go out and talk to public audiences in the United States and day, “just look at how magnificent are the people who make up our armed forces,” and to see in their eyes the tremendous pride that they have in you.  And they don’t pay attention to what you do every day, and in the way that’s the flipside of being in the business of protection, which is the better you do it, the less people have to think about it.  That’s the whole point.  But in their hearts they know you’re there.  They know they can count on you.  Pretty soon you’ll be joining that noble mission with all of your time and you’ll also be assuming the awesome responsibility that goes with it – the responsibility of leadership and the responsibility of holding in your hands the security of so many in America and around the world. Yesterday’s attacks in Brussels were a grim reminder of how serious are the dangers we face, the dangers that civilization and our country face, the challenges of this complex world.  Our thoughts and prayers are, I know yours are, with all those who are affected by this tragedy, who include, particularly worth noting, a U.S. military family that was affected by these attacks. And I, in that connection, want to assure you, and soon you’ll be doing this with me, that we do everything we can to help protect these families, and we will to help this family in this instance, and to protect our service members, wherever they are, and their families – protect them as they protect us. In the face of these acts of terrorism, the United States stands strongly in solidarity with our ally Belgium.  Brussels is an international city that hosts NATO, the European Union, and other great institutions that represent people working together for a better future, and the opposite for what the people who conducted this attack represent and stand for.  So together with them, we must and we will continue to do everything we can to protect our homeland and defeat terrorists wherever they threaten us.  No attack, no attack, can shake our resolve to accelerate the defeat of ISIL. I know that yesterday’s news only galvanizes our determination, yours too, to serve our nation and join those who came before you in this mission of defending our people and the values we share.  So before I get your questions, I want to take some time to talk about the strategic landscape, as we see it from the Pentagon – me and your Army leadership – and after that take a moment to discuss several of the lessons that I hope you’ll carry with you from this extraordinary institution here at West Point to the great challenges that are going to confront you in your career. The Army, like our entire joint force, is in the process of turning a corner from an era when we were, and I was very much a part of this, very singularly focused upon our counter-insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We had to be.  We did an excellent job.  The military execution was superb.  And we’re now entering a different strategic era, and I’m asking the Army, and our military to change and evolve, and it is. And as we look out, the leadership of the department, your senior leaders, we see no fewer than five evolving challenges, big challenges, evolving challenges.  And these are, namely, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism.  We don’t have the luxury of choice among them.  We need to deal with them all. Two of them represent, in a way, a return to great power competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deterring Russian aggression – the kind we saw in Ukraine.  We haven’t had to focus on that very much for the last quarter-century since the Soviet Union ended and the Berlin Wall came down, but now we do.  The second challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region to America’s future because it’s half of where humanity lives, and where half of the economic activity of the planet is, and that’s only growing.  And there China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose specific threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one, and that’s why – I know some of you will be going to South Korea – that’s why as they say over there, and you’ll soon say if you go there, the slogan is to be ready to “fight tonight.”  It’s not what we want, but to deter we have to be ready.  And the other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord reached last year is a good deal in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression, counter it’s malign influence in the region, and continue standing by and standing up for our friends and allies in the region. And then the fifth challenge, very different from the other four and critically important, is our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL.  We’re accelerating our campaign against ISIL, most immediately in Iraq and Syria – that’s where the parent tumor is of this cancer, and we need to defeat it there.  That is necessary, not sufficient – we need to defeat it in other places as well where it’s metastasizing like North Africa, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.  And make no mistake, we will defeat ISIL.  I’m completely confident in it.  We want to get it done as soon as we can, but we will destroy ISIL. We don’t have the luxury, as I said, of choosing among these five challenges.  We have to deal with them all – and you’re part of our plan to do so.  The Army is transitioning, as I said, to full spectrum readiness.  The force you will lead is stronger than ever.  It’s capable of more kinds of operation than ever.  To deter and win in a conflict, potential enemies have to know that we will dominate them. Your service will, and I hope it does, span many decades.  A future Chief of Staff of the Army, or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may very well be in this room.  Ten, 20 years from now, new challenges will almost certainly arise.  To help you win now, and to deal with that complex and uncertain future – the world may change – but I think that you’ll find that there are four things that will remain constant, that I predict will remain constant for you, that I want you to keep in your mind. The first is this.  Our primary mission will always be the defense of our country and our people.  When I sit with the President in the situation room, we’re always focused on America’s national interests because that’s what matters most.  While the capabilities and capacity of our fantastic institution are enormous and immense, what we commit ourselves to is something we think about very carefully. We also recognize at the same time that protecting American interests often means leading by example.  Ever since the graduates of this institution led the United States to victory in World War II, America has stood as the world’s foremost leader, partner and underwriter of stability in every region of the world.  It is a mantle we embraced again following the end of the Cold War, and one that continues today to the great benefit of our nation, and also the global community. The positive and enduring partnerships the United States has cultivated with other nations around the world are built upon our values, and reflect the way we conduct ourselves.  Nations know what we stand for.  They know how we do things and why.  They know we treat them as equals, but we take their interests into account.  That creates opportunities to defend American interests wherever and whenever necessary.  When I travel around the world what I hear always from foreign leaders is how much they like working with you.  You’re capable, competent, like no other military, but you represent values that they like.  They want to work with you.  You conduct yourselves in a way that is attractive to them.  This is important because in order to do the business of protecting the United States, we want others to help in that mission of creating a better world.  We don’t want to have to do everything ourselves.  So it’s important that you have those values, and that they like working with you.  And if you think about it, our enemies don’t have any friends.  We have all the friends and allies, and that’s because of who you are and what you represent, as well as how good you are. So whether your responsibilities take you to train, local, capable forces fighting ISIL in Iraq, say, which is what the 101st is doing in Baghdad, or strengthening our posture in the Asia Pacific with a Stryker Combat Brigade in the Philippines, you will see many opportunities where the U.S. military can make a difference around the world.  I want your good ideas.  Our nation needs your good ideas.  When you bring them forward – this is important – always be able to explain how they benefit America’s interests, and by extension the American people. Another constant, one that has echoed through the generations, is that what makes our military great is our people.  It was a former cadet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who said, “Guns and tanks and planes are nothing unless there is a solid spirit, a solid heart.” That lesson was reinforced for me several weeks ago at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, when I met with two soldiers – SGT First Class Hastings and SGT Campbell.  Both were seriously wounded in Afghanistan while accompanying Afghan forces – one in a close grenade exchange with the Taliban, the other after taking five shots – three to the SAPI and two to the body.  I spoke to them in that hangar. They were each driven – and you hear this again and again, and you all have probably heard it as well – by a single goal, which was getting back to their unit.  Back in the fight. So don’t ever forget the caliber of the soldiers you will lead as a brand-new second lieutenant.  Don’t ever forget the quality of experience of the NCOs under your command.  Don’t ever forget the families of every soldier, and the sacrifices they make.  And regardless of what branch you have selected or will select in the future, don’t ever forget that there are soldiers like SGTs Hastings and Campbell who count on you to do your utmost. My first, highest commitment as Secretary of Defense really is to our people.  We have other things that make our military great, but it’s our people that make it the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And it’s because of that commitment that I am committed to building what I’m calling the Force of the Future. In the future we have to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent from future generations.  We’re an all-volunteer force.  We like it that way.  We want to pick the members of the military, not have them given to us.  But we have to compete for them and I recognize that.  That is, by the way, the reason why we’re opening all combat positions to women.  It provides them an opportunity, but the real point from my perspective is that it provides us the opportunity, the opportunity to have access to another half of our population who can meet the standards for those branches – it’s important.  We have to compete for good people everywhere for an all-volunteer force, and that’s a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. As you grow through the ranks I want to make sure the younger generation coming in is as good as you, as good as the ones you see to your left and right today.  That needs to be true tomorrow, ten years from now, 20 years from now.  I feel that responsibility.  You will soon have that responsibility.  So when you select and assign people, remember that experience, courage on their part, courage on their part to speak up, the diversity of the experiences they’ve had and that they represent – all of that will make the whole team stronger.  That’s a lesson as old as the Army itself, and one that actually echoes across this campus, as I was learning this morning – from the memorial to Margaret Corbin, who kept her cannon firing to preserve the continental army, to the bust of Henry O. Flipper, born a slave and graduated an officer, to crest of the class of 1980, where men and women served together in 1980 for the first time with “Pride and Excellence” here. I just came from lunch with a dozen cadets who have branched infantry, including the first women to do so.  And just remember that it’s not only them who are making history, it’s you, as an institution, that is doing so.  First in training, and then in battle, you’ll demonstrate that the women who recently graduated from Ranger School, who have accompanied our Special Operations Forces, and led convoys in combat and have flown attack helicopters for the past 15 years are not just a news story, they’re a vital part of our ability to defend our country. Next, I want you to remember that our nation’s defense rests in being able to find solutions to seemingly intractable problems.  In any situation, you will encounter unexpected challenges that have to be solved at a moment’s notice. I can’t tell you what they are now.  I’ve told you what we’re facing today.  I can’t tell you with confidence what we’ll be facing in the future.  You have to have – I want you to have the courage to accept risk to solve those problems and the wisdom to determine when a risk becomes a blind gamble.  You’re responsible for the lives of the soldiers, and for accomplishing your mission.  That’s the burden of command. Let me give you a recent example from a West Point graduate, and that’s LTG Sean MacFarland, who is serving as our coalition commander in Iraq.  When he got there last year, he found a fractured Iraqi Army on the defensive, one that was trained for a narrow set of threats that didn’t include the kinds of conventional military tactics that the enemy, ISIL, was using, or even their conventional tactics that were being used effectively, to stymie the Iraqi forces in the field. Providing the same training over and over again – that same training wouldn’t accomplish the mission.  General MacFarland saw this as an opportunity – to provide advanced training and engineering capabilities to effectively change the way the Iraqi Army operated.  All of you, like Sean, are capable of this.  I’m proud to say we saw the results of this in December when the Iraqi Army retook Ramadi – bridging the Euphrates, conducting combined arms breaching, and ultimately clearing the city with the assistance that we provided. When you plan, rehearse, and execute your missions, you must always be willing to reevaluate the situation and take a new course of action when the situation demands it.  In order to do that, you have got to be open to new ideas. At the Pentagon, I have made it a priority at all levels to think, as I say, outside our five-sided box, to be open to new ways of thinking, operating, and innovating.  It’s the only way to be the best in a competitive world.  You are warriors first, but as I saw today in the physics lab, the counter-terrorism center, your cyber center, you’re also scientists, political scientists, and so much more.  Every day you crack the code in some way, and we need you to continue to do so. This should be a lesson for our enemies: never underestimate the ingenuity of the American soldier.  We need to maintain that advantage forever.  That’s why as part of the Force of the Future initiative, we’re building greater opportunities as you advance through the ranks for you to work in advanced industries outside of DoD just for a time, partner with tech companies, and get out and learn about how the rest of the world works while continuing to achieve the breakthroughs and uphold the profession of arms that makes the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And finally, I want to discuss the importance of being a leader of character.  Character is the difference between George Washington, remembered on this campus with that iconic equestrian statue, and Benedict Arnold, recalled with an unnamed plaque in the old chapel.  Both were gifted warriors, with great technical skills. But only one had the strength of character to, in the words of the cadet prayer, “choose the harder right, instead of the easier wrong.”  You don’t know when, where or how – you may not even know it at the time – but your character will be tested against these words.  And your reaction will be a reflection of your true self.  In my time working with some of the finest alumni of this institution, I’ve observed that combat doesn’t as much build character, as it does reveal it. It’s a big world out there, and we are a great nation, with great responsibilities.  And we stand on the foundation of the character that both you and this institution provide around the world. Those of you who will be commissioned this spring will are about to join the noblest profession there is – a profession that will have you waking up every day to help defend this country and make a better world.  As you embark on this, know that our nation is 100 percent behind you.  I’m a thousand percent behind you, though we know that’s not really possible, but you know what I mean.  We know what you’re putting into this.  We know what you’ll sacrifice.  And we know what you’re able to achieve.  There’s nothing we appreciate more.  There’s nothing that makes me prouder to be where I am and to look out and to be with you. Thanks for having me, and I look forward to answering some of your questions.

"Sept. 20, 2017","Welcome Minister Payne, Ambassador, Secretary Moriarty – congratulations to you sir, military officers, members of the delegation, welcome to the Pentagon. Minister Payne, it’s great to join you again in, I think, our 6th meeting in about 8 months. Your visit today is a reminder that the Australia-U.S. defense alliance is absolutely ironclad, forged by 65 years of mutual trust, respect earned on the battlefield, and friendship across the sea – a friendship formed in the trenches of World War I during the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918, when our troops first fought side by side, under the command of an Australian general. That was the first time U.S. troops fought under foreign command, and the battle helped turn the tide on the Western front. Since then, we have fought side by side many times and we look forward to commemorating “100 years of Mateship” in 2018. The courage, dedication, and ferocity of your troops is as inspiring now as it was in various theaters throughout our history. I witnessed this dedication firsthand while serving alongside Australian forces, and I am reminded daily as our troops fight alongside each other on the shared battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. You are a trusted ally who tells us what we need to hear, not what we might want to hear, and that’s the mark of a true friend and one always worth listening to. Today we will discuss threats to our common security, from terrorism and destabilizing activities in the South China Sea, to North Korean provocations. You and I were together at NATO some time ago. NATO’s Secretary-General Stoltenberg said last week, “the reckless behavior of North Korea is a global threat and requires a global response,” and I know our two nations will stand together in defense of freedom and liberty. For we see, Australia is fully committed to global stability, global security, and passing freedom to the next generation of Australians. Minister, members of the delegation, thank you for coming. You, your team, and your ideas are always welcome here in the Pentagon. Thank you, Minister Payne. # # # ",Bilateral Meeting with Australian Defence Minister Payne,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1318372/bilateral-meeting-with-australian-defence-minister-payne/
"Sept. 7, 2017","  Welcome Your Excellency Minister, Ambassador, military officers, members of the delegation. You are most welcome at the Pentagon today as a special ally. Your Excellency, it is good to see you again after meeting during my trip to Europe, I think in February.  It is good to see you because our two nations share a meaningful history of security cooperation and understanding. Since the intervention to oust Saddam Hussein’s army from your sovereign territory in 1991, our countries have maintained a highly productive military relationship.  As I mentioned in front of Your Highness and the President today, I fondly recall the 50 Kuwaiti soldiers who served bravely in my Marine Infantry Battalion during our assault through minefields – your young Air Force NCOs fighting together with us.  Now our militaries remain bonded by shared security concerns, which I felt was highlighted in today’s earlier meeting. Our views on these concerns mirror almost to the letter.  Regional stability is strengthened by Kuwait’s robust commitment to fighting terrorism. In light of our common counterterrorism cause, our countries maintain a very close military relationship. In recent years, we have partnered in joint training and exchange programs focused on enhancing counterterrorism at the local unit level.  In addition, we greatly appreciate your Emir’s leadership and tireless efforts to mediate the recent rift between Qatar and other countries in the GCC. Kuwait stepped forward in its usual way – it was a difficult situation for your Emir, and we appreciate his leadership.  I look forward to discussing how we can further advance our countries’ military partnership in the coming months and years, in particular, by exploring ways to increase Kuwait’s involvement in the D-ISIS campaign.  Your Excellency, members of the delegation, thank you for coming. You are most welcome here.  # # # ",Bilateral Meeting with Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister al-Sabah,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1302671/bilateral-meeting-with-kuwaiti-deputy-prime-minister-and-defense-minister-al-sa/
"Oct. 28, 2016","Thanks, John, for that introduction, and, more importantly – where’d John go? – for your many years of service, many years of friendship to me, and wonderful service to our country over so many years, and leadership of this great institution. I also want to thank CSIS for hosting this important conference, and I want to commend my Deputy Secretary of Defense – Bob – and General Paul Selva – guys, thanks for holding the fort down last week – for their leadership and hard work in leading the technology investment thrusts we call the Third Offset Strategy.  I’ll speak about that, but of course, in this speech I also want to speak about about innovation in all its dimensions – of which technological innovation is a piece, a very important piece.  Because being more innovative in every way we can is critical to the future success of our military and our Defense Department. Today, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, more innovative.  That’s why our military edge is second-to-none.  And it’s a fact every American ought to be proud of. But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  And we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century – we have to earn it again and again.  And that’s what this is all about:  innovating to stay the best.  And I want to talk to you today about how we’re doing that in some different areas – our technology, our operations, our organization, and above all, our people. And right now it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a relentlessly changing, and fiercely competitive world.  There’s the faster pace of change, which sets up a fierce competition between the present and the future; competition with other nations, not only with us, but also with each other; and competition with terrorists and other malefactors for whom we are the game to beat – if they can – even if only in one place and at one time. Technology is one example of such change and competition that many of us have long been familiar with.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.  Today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  And much of the frontier of innovation is commercial, leading to additional sources of competitive dynamism outside our five walls. Against this background, your Defense Department is confronting a world security environment that’s also dramatically different than the last generation, and even the generation before that.  Indeed, the U.S. military is at this moment addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL – destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.  And at the same time as all of this, we’re preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges – we have to do them all.  And as the world changes and complexity increases, we’ll have to change, too – how to invest, how we fight, how we operate as an organization, and how we attract and nourish talent. As we do, we have to be able to move fast, because the advantages we expect to derive from each innovative cycle today will not last as long as they used to.  All the commercial and global change that’s occurred across the technology landscape has made repeated and rapid cycles necessary, and made high-end tech a lot more accessible to competitors. Think about it.  While the Cold War arms race was characterized by the inexorable but steady accumulation of strength – with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons – today’s era of military competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else, and even change the game.  In the area of investment, it’s no longer just a matter of what we buy.  Now more than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, whom we buy them from, and how rapidly and creatively we can adapt them and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies technologically. That’s why I’ve been so intent as Secretary of Defense not only to plant the seeds for a number of different technologies that we think will be determinative in giving us a warfighting advantage for the future – more on those in a moment – but also to be more innovative and agile in all aspects of DoD:  in our operations, in our organization, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer forces. In each of these four areas, I – along with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Service Chiefs, all our excellent Combatant Commanders, and the Defense Department’s civilian leadership – have had a lot of help.  We’ve had help from Washington think tanks like CSIS, from our defense labs and industry partners, and also from many innovative Americans who understand the innovation imperative and who aren’t in our community now, but understand the need for our mission of national security and want to help.  And all of us have been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation. And I want to focus on that in the rest of my remarks – the clear strategic imperative we have to innovate in each area, how we’ve been innovating so far, and how we need to innovate going forward. Given the topic of this particular conference, I’ll start with technology. The strategic imperative to innovate technologically is well-known to those who’ve been paying attention, and that’s many of you here at CSIS.  Nations like Russia and China are trying to close the technology gap with the United States, and as I noted, high-end military technology has diffused – sometimes becoming available to countries like North Korea and Iran, as well as non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on technological systems like satellites and the Internet has grown, creating vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. To stay ahead of these threats, and to stay the best, we’re pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, robotics, undersea warfare, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and much, much more.  And I’ll repeat yet again, since it keeps coming up, that when it comes to using autonomy in our weapons systems, we will always have a human being in decision-making about the use of force. Now we’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed – a budget I strongly encourage Congress to pass when they return to Washington next month – will invest $72 billion in research and development in the next year alone.  That’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent last year on R&D combined. This budget marked a strategic turning point for the Department of Defense, with our Third Offset Strategy driving a wide range of new, innovative technological investments in order to advance and sharpen our military edge.  We’re making these investments because we aren’t yet exactly certain what, or where, this offset is going to come from – it could be one area of technology, or several.  Remember, previous offset strategies were generational successes, reflections of the security environment of their eras, and were only recognized as such after the fact.  Today, speed and agility are key, and because of the world we live in, the next offset will not look like previous ones.  And it may not even end up being what we might consider a traditional ‘offset’ strategy at all.  That’s why we’re seeding these investments in lots of different technologies – so we can see which ones germinate, how they develop, what they produce, and how we can use them most effectively. And in addition to these critical investments, it’s important to note how DoD is innovating technologically – how we’re innovating technologically – by creating technologies from within, by bringing in technology from without, and by repurposing technologies and capabilities we already have.  Because different entities are focused on each. Within the Defense Department, we have dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country – each one home to great technological innovators, both civilian and military, who work closely with a very innovative defense industry that’s long supported us and kept us on the cutting edge.  And they’re continuing to do so today, across a wide range of critical technologies.  For example, our Navy labs are developing and prototyping undersea drones in multiple sizes and with diverse payloads – which is important, since among other reasons unmanned undersea vehicles can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  Also, our Army labs are working on gun-based missile defenses, which can help defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round than more expensive interceptors – imposing higher costs on the attacker.  And our Air Force labs are pioneering applications for neuromorphic computing – that is, hardware, software, and systems inspired by the working mechanisms of the human brain – which offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current computing architectures, and enabling information superiority in air, space, and cyberspace. As I said, America’s innovative defense industry is a key partner in this – because, remember, we don’t build anything in the Pentagon.  That’s not the American way.  The Soviet Union tried that, and it didn’t work out very well for them. Today, with more technological innovation happening in the commercial sector, we need to be able to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit as well as those within, and welcome them into our defense technology community.  That’s why last year I created our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – to help build bridges with startups and other commercial technology firms located in innovation ecosystems across the United States, and help us more quickly adopt technologies that can help our troops accomplish their missions.  DIUx opened its doors last August with a West Coast office in Silicon Valley, and since then, we iterated and launched DIUx 2.0 in May, and opened a DIUx East Coast office in Boston, and established an outpost in Austin, Texas.  One important area where DIUx recently solicited proposals is in micro-satellites and advanced analytics – leveraging the revolution in commercial space and machine learning to transform how we use space-based tools and advanced data processing to provide critical situational awareness to forces around the world.  And it also adds resilience, by the way, to our national space architecture. Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO, we’re also changing and adapting how we use existing platforms and technologies already in our inventory – giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  As some of you know, I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense – putting Will Roper, by the way, in charge of it, Will – and earlier this year, I lifted the veil on several of its projects that we’re investing in, such as the arsenal plane, a new anti-ship capability for the SM-6 missile, and swarming drones on the sea and in the air.  In fact, this technology took a large step forward just this week.  You’ll be hearing more about that in the months to come A prominent theme of SCO’s work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions across varied domains.  One example of this I want to highlight – it’s something that we haven’t talked about publically before today – is SCO’s project to develop a cross-domain capability for the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.  By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they’re enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land.  With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.* Going forward, as these and other investments yield new weapons systems and warfighting capabilities in the coming years – some of them much sooner than you might think – they’ll need to be demonstrated so that they’re effective in deterring future conflict.  And it will be important to ensure they are allowed to run their course.  We have to protect the most promising, and integrate those concepts and ideas into our programs, rather than let them be uprooted just because they’re new – which is always a tendency in tight budgets. Of course, how we use technology is just as important as the technology itself, if not more, which is why we’re also investing aggressively in operational innovation.  Our plans and operations must account not only for the evolving challenges we face from our competitors, but also the opportunities afforded by new capabilities as they come on line – so technological and operational innovation must go hand-in-glove. Here, the strategic imperative is rooted in the fact that while we’ve spent the last 15 years innovating expertly – and I’m very proud of it – in how we kill terrorists and counter insurgencies, we did so to some extent at the expense of our expertise in full-spectrum warfighting.  Other nations have gotten good at that over the years, and in some cases they’ve been devising new methods to try to counter our advantages and pre-empt us from being able to respond – not just by developing high-tech weapons, but also by crafting operational approaches such as hybrid warfare techniques. For these reasons, we’ve been reinvigorating our training across the services to return to full-spectrum readiness, and we’ve been re-thinking how we operate to find new advantages against potential adversaries – including by changing and adapting how we might fight with friends and allies.  For example, in Europe, we’ve been working with our NATO allies to adapt and write a new playbook for our Strong and Balanced strategic approach to Russia – one that takes the lessons of history and leverages our alliance’s strengths in new, networked ways to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare; to integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence; and to adjust our posture and presence so we can be more agile and responsive.  And in the Asia-Pacific, we’ve been modernizing our alliances, strengthening new partnerships, and helping to build a Principled and Inclusive regional Security Network. This rubber meets the road in how we’re revising our actual plans for potential operations themselves.  Now, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational concepts to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, but we’ve also updated our core contingency plans to make sure they apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  And at the same time that we innovate in our plans to counter these conventional threats, we’re also ensuring that – with respect to potential confrontations with nuclear powers – we continue to sustain America’s nuclear deterrent as we recapitalize our nuclear triad and infrastructure. Overall, we’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners take into account how to prevail if they have to execute their plan at the same time another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into a trap of presuming the one they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  We’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we have to be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them.  And we’re prioritizing transregional and transfunctional integration in our plans – which is an imperative considering that conflict doesn’t segment anymore, and the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  This was one of the Goldwater-Nichols reforms I proposed here at CSIS nearly seven months ago, and it will be coordinated on my behalf by our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford – whom, by the way, we’re very fortunate to have in his job.  Recommending him to President Obama was one of the best decisions I’ve made as Secretary of Defense. The result of this is that we’ve revised all of our war plans to ensure we have the agility and ability to win the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future.  And while I can’t say more – and if any audience can appreciate why, a CSIS audience can – I’ll tell you that I’m very proud of this evolving family of plans. Now, innovation in technology and in operations are necessary for us, but they’re not sufficient – because at the pace today’s world demands, we can only succeed in these by being an agile organization that nurtures innovation in all its forms.  So we’re also investing in innovative organizational structures and practices. The strategic imperative here is that DoD must be an organization that better fosters innovative thinking and ideas that can help us to stay ahead of our competitors.  The Defense Department is one of the largest organizations in the world, and as many of you know well, we can be pretty bureaucratic and slow-moving, where it’s easy to default to the status quo of continuing to do things the same way we’ve always done them.  But we can’t afford that in today’s security environment – we need to be a place where thinking differently is welcomed and fostered, not where good ideas go to die just because they happen to be new. Over the last few years, I’ve created a number of entities to help signify and drive innovation throughout DoD – including SCO, DIUx, and the Defense Digital Service.  And I most recently created the Defense Innovation Board, to advise me and future leadership on how we can keep growing more competitive. As you know, the Defense Innovation Board is one of several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise.  The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served – and which, by the way, we’re grateful that John Hamre chairs – has a membership with exceptional foreign and defense policymaking experience.  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoD’s vast business enterprise and practices.  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role – its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches that have worked in their leadership experience, and that might be applicable to us. The Innovation Board is chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and its membership represents a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, Mike McQuade from United Technologies, and retired Admiral Bill McRaven, now chancellor of the University of Texas.  And I’ve charged them and the rest of the board to help keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation – to support innovators themselves, the people in our defense enterprise who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of our competitors. At the outset, I gave them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in DoD, along the lines of our Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which invited hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already routinely conduct.  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first time in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful, we’re now expanding it to other parts of DoD.  This is the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Innovation Board – things that are out there and that might be useful to us. Now, of course, not everything in the private sector will make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s dedicated to the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn, and ways we can operate more effectively. The Defense Innovation Board held its first public meeting earlier this month and made some preliminary recommendations to me and the public about some innovative practices that might make sense for us to adopt.  And today I want to tell you about several that I’ve decided we’re going to do. First, we’re going to increase our focus on recruiting talented computer scientists and software engineers into our force, both military and civilian.  We’ll do this through targeted recruiting initiatives ranging from our Reserve Officer Training Corps to our civilian scholarship-for-service program that’s intended to help build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders – all with the goal of making computer science a core competency of the department. Second, we’re going to invest more broadly in machine learning, through targeted challenges and prize competitions, and not through a new brick-and-mortar institution, but rather through a ‘virtual center of excellence’ model that establishes stretch goals and incentivizes academic and private-sector researchers to achieve them.  Since this is an area where both the academy and commercial technology companies have been making significant strides, I’ve asked DIUx to pilot this approach by sponsoring an initial prize challenge focused on computer vision and machine learning. And third, we’re going to create a DoD Chief Innovation Officer, who will act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and will serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, including but not limited to those suggested by the Defense Innovation Board – such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD at scale, sponsoring innovation contests and tournaments, and providing training and education that promotes new ideas and approaches to collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Many different organizations have recently embraced this position, and also started to regularly run these kind of innovation tournaments and competitions – including tech companies like IBM, Intel, and Google – and it’s time we did as well, to help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches, and be recognized for them. Going forward, I’m confident that the logic behind everything I’m talking about today will be self-evident to future defense leadership, as will the value of these efforts – but they also need to have the momentum and institutional foundation to keep going under their own steam and to continue to thrive.  We must ensure that we keep leading the way, and keep disrupting, challenging, and inspiring all of us to change for the better. And this brings me, finally, to how we’re innovating in terms of our people, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force.  While it’s the last area of innovation I’m going to discuss today, it’s also the most important – because the fact is, our people are the source of every innovative thing we’ve ever done, are doing, or will do. Indeed, much more than our technology, operations, and organization, our people are the key to us having the finest fighting force – in our uniformed military, in our DoD civilian workforce, and in the defense industry that supports us.  And that means we need to compete for good people as far into the future as we can. Now the good news is, there’s lots of opportunity here, as well as new techniques and technologies in talent management – such as the kind of advanced data analytics that underpin companies like LinkedIn.  But there are also challenges we face – in terms of the limitations of our current technology in the human resources area, and as generations and labor markets change.  Even so – so even as our force of today is outstanding – we must ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer in future generations of defense.  And that’s why we’ve been taking step after step to build what I call the Force of the Future. I’ve announced four different ‘links’ so far to the Force of the Future.  The first focused on building and increasing on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions – creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and more.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or a project.  And it will also allow more of DoD and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – of which there are many – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovative ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about, working with defense. Next, the Force of the Future’s second link focused on increasing retention among our ranks through increased support to our military families.  It’s often said that when you recruit a servicemember, you retain a family; after all, it’s no secret that military life is difficult, and can be especially tough on our military families.  And let me remind you that our force is largely a married one, with about 70 percent of officers and 50 percent of enlisted who are married.  Now, we can’t change the fundamentals of military service, but we can make some changes to make life easier for our married people – and increase the possibility that they’ll want to stay at that critical moment when they’re trying to reconcile military life and family life.  That’s why we expanded maternity and paternity leave, why we extended childcare hours on bases, and why we’re giving more families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional service commitments. After that, the third link to the Force of the Future focused on how we can make some common-sense improvements to military talent management – particularly for our officer corps.  In some cases, our current system proves too rigid.  It can limit the ability of our services to achieve the right force mix they need, especially at a time when we’re seeking to promote a wider range of experience, perspective, and training to strengthen the overall effectiveness of the force.  That’s why we want to give the military services the authority to do things like expand lateral entry for more specialties and adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance. And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future made clear that this is not only about our military, but also about our civilian workforce.  When people talk about DoD civilians, they’re talking about over 700,000 talented Americans serving across the country and around the world.  More than 85 percent of them live outside of the DoD – D.C., excuse me – the D.C. area.  They fix aircraft, they operate shipyards and ranges, and more.  They do critical jobs, and without them DoD wouldn’t function.  So the goal here is the same as with our military personnel:  to make sure our future civilian workforce is just as great as the one we have today, in several ways – by directly hiring civilian employees from college campuses, by creating a new two-way civilian talent exchange program with the private sector, by expanding our scholarship-for-service program in mission-critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, and more. Also, in addition to each of these links, over the last year we opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now draw on 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force – focusing purely on a person’s willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission, and giving everyone the full and equal opportunity to do so. Going forward, there will still be much more work to do – and you’ll soon be hearing from me more about the Force of the Future.  But these links span the spectrum of our opportunities, our challenges, and the lifetime of a member of our all-volunteer force – recruitment, retention, development, transition – and also our valuable civilian workforce.  And for the first time in a long time, DoD’s Personnel and Readiness office has a real, proactive agenda – a concrete action plan to guide its efforts, so that they’re doing more than just being reactive belatedly to issues that crop up.  And based on support for these efforts that I’m seeing in the military services and across our department, I’m confident that the implementation of all these initiatives will continue moving forward, and ensure that the Force of the Future is as great as the force of today. I’ve described today a lot of ways the Department of Defense is changing and will continue to change in the future, but I want to close by reminding all of you, all of DoD, and all of America that as we sit here this morning, our country’s strengths are undeniable. We have the best military, of course – spanning our people, our investments, our dedication to the mission, and the public support we receive from the American people – but there’s much more than that.  Our economy is growing.  We have world-class schools and universities.  We uphold the right values, which is one reason why we have an unrivaled network of friends and allies.  Meanwhile the operational experience of our force – hard-earned – is second-to-none.  And we have the greatest innovative culture on the planet.  When we’ve brought that innovative culture to bear in service of others – that is, to defend our country and help make a better world for our children – it’s long been America’s open military secret.  And we remain dedicated to doing so, and it can be so. We have a legacy of innovating, but that in itself is not enough.  That’s why we’re moving aggressively toward a more innovative future, and why everything I’ve talked about today is intended to ensure exactly that.  Going forward, our success will depend on whether we can keep it up. Like its predecessors, the next wave of innovation and advantage will be a generational success – and it’s only just beginning.  We probably don’t even know yet the names of the people who will make it a reality.  More likely than not, it won’t be by me or anyone from my generation.  Instead, it’ll be the generation that comes after. It’ll be junior officers and DoD civilians fresh out of graduate school – some of them here today, perhaps – who decide to spend a year outside of the department at Google or somewhere else, and work with an expert in data science or machine learning. It’ll be the software engineers and bioscientists who get to know our mission by working with one of our DIUx outposts, and then choose to do a tour of duty in the Defense Digital Service or working at one of our DoD labs. It’ll be the enlisted soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who come up with new operational concepts for overcoming potential adversaries using advanced technologies that may not even exist yet, or defeating a terrorist group we haven’t heard of. They’re the ones – they’re the ones – who will end up reinventing and changing anew how we will deter, fight, and win wars in the future.  Our job is to give them the foundation, the right kind of Pentagon to help them succeed:  one that’s more agile and innovative than ever before.  As long as we do, they will ensure – like those who came before them – that our military remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Thank you.  [*Please note, due to an unfortunate error, the following paragraphs were omitted from this speech.] DIUx and SCO share the characteristics of speed and agility, which has long been a focus of mine.  When I served as Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was imperative that we quickly get our troops in harm’s way the tools they needed to accomplish their mission.  We started the Warfighter Senior Integration Group, which is designed to bring together and bring to bear the full weight of the Defense Department’s senior leadership on addressing our most critical operational needs.  And we established a “fast lane” to rapidly field cutting-edge, much-needed capabilities, like mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and inexpensive aerostat balloons equipped with cameras to help monitor the security of our forward operating bases. Ultimately this evolved into what we in the Pentagon today call Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs) – or the things we need right away for fighting the wars we’re in now – and Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs) – the things we need as soon as possible for a conflict that could start tomorrow.  As I’ve said before, the system is far from perfect, but it has injected some badly needed agility into the Pentagon’s notoriously slow bureaucracy – agility that I’ve been determined to enhance as Secretary of Defense.  And DIUx and SCO build on this legacy with their focus on quickly meeting the near-term needs of not only today’s, but also tomorrow’s warfighter.

"Aug. 4, 2016","Well, good evening everyone, and what a spectacular evening it is tonight. Let me first say this to the folks that are here, General Paxton, Jay, stop talking. Bob Neller, guys I've known for a long time. You all ought to know I asked to come to this. I'm going to tell you why in a minute, but I thought it was important for you to know I wanted to be here tonight, and I appreciate that General Neller asked me to come. I appreciate that, Bob. I see Chairman Dunford's here, General Milley, Admiral Rogers, all the other General and Flag Officers, and everyone else. Debbie, more about you in a moment. But what was already noted was what you do for our wounded warriors, and have done for our wounded warriors’ families. Thank you. And I see all these Paxton's out there. There are lots of Paxton's in the audience. They look so magnificent, and you must be so proud. We are. And, to all the Marines aboard ship, at every forward station all around the world, anybody's who's listening to this. Thank you. Thanks for always standing faithful, prepared to answer any call, fight in any clime or place, and just look behind you. I think there's some folks who came out and are watching this parade from outside tonight, but just look behind you and look at the magnificence of that. It's just a part just to representation of the millions who protect this country every night. It's a big world out there, and we're the biggest player on it. We have the greatest interest. We have the greatest power. We have the greatest influence. We stand for the greatest things. The people that these wonderful Marines standing in front of you represent, they fight for that every day, they stand for that every day. It's not a game. Serious business, and we're not short of things to do. So, if you wake up in the morning, and you take your kids to school, and you kiss them goodbye, and you go to work, and you live your lives, and you dream your dreams, and you live lives that are full and you're American, it's because of them. I think all those who are visiting from outside, those of you inside our community know that, but those from outside ought to know that. It's a pretty big deal, and we're very grateful to them. Now listen, I'm going to be brief because Bob Neller's going to speak to all of Jay Paxton's really considerable achievements over a very long career to the Marine Corps and our country. But, the reason I asked to be here was this. I wanted to share with you just a little bit of what Jay and I have done together, and that's -- Jay and I have done together over the last seven and a half years, God help us, that we've been working together. Some of which I've simply witnessed, some of which we've done together. And also, by the way, the seven and a half years that Stephanie, and Jay, and Debbie have been friends. So I picked one thing that sticks out particularly in my mind. Let me just tell you the story. In 2009, 2010, Jay was my co-chair, in something that was called the Pentagon's Counter IED Senior Integration Group -- I assume you all know what an IED is? And, at that time IEDs -- or improvised explosive devices -- remained the number one killer of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. MRAPs that we had designed for the flat Iraqi desert, and it worked there, performed poorly in the mountains of Afghanistan, and too many brave Americans were going into harm's way with inadequate protection. Jay was determined to change that. He brought a Field Commanders operational style to the E-Ring of the Pentagon of all places. Focused on identifying solutions, assigning responsibility, and generating answers. Answers like, ""It can't happen,"" or, ""It's too costly,"" or, ""It'll take years,"" were unacceptable to him. Jay's answer was always, “figure it out and come back to us with what you need.” Jay helped turn the old Pentagon process of “Require, then Acquire” into “Acquire and then Require” instead, so our troops would have access to what they needed when they needed it without having to wait for the acquisition system to catch up to what they needed. The most significant example of this was the effort to produce and deploy a new all-terrain vehicle of the MRAP called the M-ATV, which was better suited to Afghanistan's varied landscapes, it had independent front and rear suspensions rather than a spring suspension, a V-shaped armored hull to deflect blasts away from the troops inside, and thanks in large part to Jay's leadership and focus we were able to produce and deliver 8,000 of these vehicles to the far reaches of Afghanistan which, take a look at the globe. It's about the most ungodly place you can possibly think of fighting a war from a logistics point of view, to Afghanistan. Eight thousand of them. Trained the Marine and soldiers who would use them. Eight thousand of them in just sixteen months from the order to trained and delivered. Now Jay and I, during all that time, spent a lot of time on the road together getting to know what ground truth was, checking the status on commitments that we'd made. Had we fulfilled them, and seeing the capability needs that soldiers and marines needed for themselves. We visited troops that were preparing to deploy at Twentynine Palms, at Ft. Irwin, Fort Polk, sometimes for their second and third tours, by the way, and asked them if they were getting the right training. They were getting familiarized with the right equipment to defeat the threats that they would experience, and that they knew they would experience because they had in the field. We visited the production facilities to thank the people who were making the M-ATV and to delay any obstacles to their rapid production. Jay was also always in contact with our logistics people and our transportation commander, working out the really extraordinary land, sea, and air undertaking required to get equipment to Afghanistan. Multi-modal transportation kind of things. He and I visited the State Department, to Capitol Hill, the intelligence community, et cetera, and everything else, understanding that to succeed there needed to be a whole government effort. Above all, in our frequent trips to Afghanistan, Jay always stepped off the plane ready to work. Meeting with senior commanders, Leatherneck or elsewhere out in the field, and getting out to forward operating bases and the combat outposts to speak with the troops, ask them what they were up against. Always the same question, “What do you need? How can we help? At one point, we even put together an armored convoy and went down to Chaman Crossing -- I'm sure you'll remember this --  so we could see for ourselves that single lane checkpoint from Pakistan into Afghanistan through which all our cargo moved. And, of course, which we were told couldn't be improved, but it actually could be. On these trips Jay took every opportunity to speak individually to every Marine, every soldier, every American servicemember he could. He'd shake their hands, he'd look in their eyes, and he'd let them know that they mattered, and that we're here for them, not the other way around. He always made that clear, that we'd do everything we could for them. He took the time to address their questions, to engage in an open and warm way, especially the junior service members. Great humility, good humor, gave them the confidence that they could do what they needed to do, and that we'd do what we needed to do for them. That was something he did throughout his career, he made sure the troops understood they were important, heard, valued, and that he was there for them. He took their concerns to heart, and then he found a way to deliver. I'll give you another example. When Marines and soldiers describe just how different detectors and tools work in different situations, Jay created these depots where people could go and familiarize themselves with the equipment that they'd fall in on when they arrived in deployment. When commanders at some forward operating bases and combat outposts described needs for better surveillance overhead of them, Jay didn't just fight for greater access to all the fancy stuff, we found ways -- he found ways to create persistent localized ISR, balloons, and it was with his leadership that we went from four to 144 such balloons rising above our troops and Marines positions in Afghanistan, giving them total situational awareness in all directions every day. Now, all this I'm describing is just one little chapter in the career, the 42-year career, God help us, you and me, of Jay Paxton in our Marine Corps. All that time he had the backs of Marines. He made sure the Pentagon, the entirety of the Pentagon, did the same for the Marines and other service members. And it's not just that he held people accountable for delivering on their promises, it's that he made them want to do it. He made them understand that that's what they should do. He had this miraculous power of making people understand that they could make a difference and want to do it, and that's what he did -- to make them feel the same responsibility that he had. Just like Bob would do, Bob Neller, when he assumed his responsibilities as my co-chair also. Same stories about Bob. Jay Paxton made great changes possible when it was needed most. He saved lives, countless lives. Made sure the mission was accomplished -- many missions. So, Jay, I'm so proud of you. Our country's so proud of you, and Debbie, for so many reasons, but I just wanted to share one with this audience on your last night as a Marine, and I'm very grateful for everything you've done throughout your career. We'll always be your friends, your lifelong friend, congratulations my friend.

"March 1, 2016","Thanks, Gloria [Duffy], so much.  What a wonderful, warm introduction.  And Gloria left herself out of that story, and I want to get back to that in just one moment, old pal.  I also want to recognize Secretary Perry, Secretary Schultz.  Thanks both.  Many other distinguished guests here.  Thanks all of you for coming. One of my core goals in this job has been to build, and in some cases to rebuild, the bridges between the Pentagon and America’s wonderfully innovative and strong technology community.  When I visited here the first time as Secretary of Defense back last April, I discovered that I was the first Secretary of Defense to have visited Silicon Valley in almost 20 years.  So today, it’s my pleasure to be here on my third official trip in that time to the Bay Area to speak with you about the common challenges we face and the extraordinary opportunities that we share. Now, almost a quarter century ago, Gloria and I had the privilege of working together for Bill Perry in the Defense Department during those critical days after the end of the Cold War.  It was evident then, as it was after the end of World War II, that America would be called upon to stand as the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world.  It’s a role we continue to fulfill today, even as we’re now entering a new strategic era.  And as I mentioned that – those former times – I need to say that we take it for granted now, but without the effort of Gloria Duffy who was carrying out our program for Secretary Perry and me, those nuclear weapons would not have been removed from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.  That is a historic achievement.  So there you go. I came from Washington where last week I laid out our defense budget for 2017.  In that budget, we are and we need to take a long view in our mission to defend the United States.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  This is particularly important today, because today’s security environment, like everything else, is rapidly changing.  It’s competitive.  It’s dramatically different from the last 25 years.  It’s going to require of us new ways of investing and operating for the U.S. military. Five evolving challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – now drive DoD’s planning and budgeting.  And I want to describe briefly each of them to you before I dive more deeply into some issues that I know are top-of-mind for this particular community. The first two of the five challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great power competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression.  The second challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region for America’s future, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not. Now, we don’t desire conflict with either of those countries, and while I need to say that they pose some similar challenges militarily, they are very different nations and very different situations, and our preference is to work together with important nations.  But we also cannot blind ourselves to their apparent goals and actions. And meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one; that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say and have said for decades now, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and malign influence against our allies and friends, particularly Israel. The fifth challenge – very different from the other four, very important – is our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL, which we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, where we’re accelerating our campaign in every dimension, as well as where ISIL is metastasizing around the world.  We’re doing that in North Africa.  We’re doing that in Afghanistan, where we continue to stand with the Afghan government and people to counter Al Qaida, and now ISIL.  And all the time, all the while, we’re continuing to work with other government agencies to protect our people here in the homeland. We don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges.  But we do have the ability to set a course for the future: a future that’s uncertain but will surely be competitive and demanding of America’s leadership, values, and military edge.  That’s why a common theme across our budget is that DoD has to innovate to be competitive in a competitive world – as I like to say, we in the Pentagon need to think outside of our five-sided box.  And that’s why, just to give you one measure, we’re spending $71.8 billion on research and development next year alone, constantly increasing.  For a little local context, that is more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google spent on R&D last year combined. That money, those funds go to fund things like making DoD the leader, a leader in cybersecurity – more on that later – advancing our commanding lead in undersea capabilities, and developing new hypersonic missiles that can fly over five times the speed of sound.  It involves advancing artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics, so that no matter what our enemies throw at our systems, they just work.  It enables taking long-existing systems and giving them surprising new capabilities.  And it invests in new strategic approaches to preventing and winning conflicts against 21st century threats. All this reflects our understanding of how much technology development has changed in recent decades.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially by DoD.  Today, much more technology is commercial.  And as many of you know, the competition is global. For these reasons, our budget also invests hundreds of millions of dollars next year in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s technology and business community, including here in the Bay Area.  Because we need a strong partnership to succeed in the 21st century, to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  One way we’re reaching out is through our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx as we call it, which I opened in Mountain View last year to explore different ways – a  variety of different ways – for DoD to better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem and build relationships with local companies, some of which I’ll be meeting with later today.  And we’re still exploring, we’re still innovating because we want to be iterative, we want to be agile.  Another example is the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes that we’re co-funding with the private sector in key technology frontiers, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics located in San Jose.  There, over 30 of our partner organizations have a presence between Silicon Valley and the Golden Gate Bridge, including companies from Apple to Lockheed Martin to Xerox.  We opened that a few months ago on my previous visit. We’re making these investments here because our military must always be capable enough to deter even the most advanced future threats in a changing and competitive world.  And this means that just like competitive companies here in the Bay Area, we have to innovate and seize opportunities in everything we do. Just as companies here are constantly restructuring and reevaluating their approaches to their competitors, we too at DoD are doing the same, making our contingency plans and our operations more flexible and more dynamic in every region.  I can’t talk about this much here, but it’s yet another place where our military commanders excel over others. Just as companies here compete furiously for the best talent, we in DoD must do the same.  It’s an all-volunteer force.  That’s why we’re building what I call the Force of the Future.   Because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people.  They are what make our military the world’s finest fighting force.  And in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent from future generations.  That’s also why we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of Americans for our all-volunteer force. Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. And just as companies here in San Francisco continually seek greater efficiency to benefit both their customers and their shareholders, we in DoD are pushing Congress for much-needed reforms across our enterprise – from acquisition reform, to closing bases that we don’t need, to reducing overhead – so that your taxpayer dollars will be spent more wisely, and so that our troops get everything they need to succeed and come home safely. We’re doing all these things to make sure that the remarkable stability and prosperity that’s been achieved in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world can endure.  Trade requires safe passage.  Investment requires stability.  Innovation requires freedom.  And each of these requires security. It’s been said that security is like oxygen; when you have enough of it, you tend to pay no attention to it, but when there isn’t – when you don’t have it, it’s all you can think of.  Security is what enables the stability and success of global markets, and the very foundation that shapes the global order depends on the physical and perceived security that the Department of Defense provides. Whether you think about it or not, this community right here can and will continue to thrive because that foundation has been rock-solid – from the seas to space to cyberspace.  Indeed, the Bay Area’s prosperity depends on connectivity to the wider world and stable markets enriched by global investments.  It always has.  First as a port in the Gold Rush through to the present.  And now today, this community thrives because of an open global marketplace, including over the Internet.  And increasingly, many tech leaders here are now seeking to reach above the sky, building and launching path-breaking satellite and space technology – a reflection of how the world looks here, to you in the Bay Area, it looks to you to see what that next great thing will be. In these three critical domains – the oceans, the Internet, and outer space – continuing to ensure the free movement of information, goods, and services will require the private sector and DoD to work together.  And it will require fresh thinking – in the Bay Area, yes, but also in Washington – to chart a future that brings a common benefit, and a common wealth, to all of us. We’ve done this before.  Seventy years of security, stability and prosperity on both sides of the Pacific didn’t happen on its own.  Neither did the extraordinary leaps that allowed us to network the world and reach for the stars.  All three were a product of hard work and focus by generations of individuals – military and civilian, government and industry alike – who stepped forward together to build that prosperous future.  The government helped ignite the spark, but this was the place that nurtured the flame that created incredible applications.  Now, we must do so once again, and renew and strengthen our partnership, lest others chart the future instead of us. Let me begin with the guiding example of the sea.  San Francisco’s history, as I noted, is inextricably trade – tied to trade in the Pacific.  The remarkable diversity of commerce and people who’ve crossed the Golden Gate over the centuries proves that the Pacific has never been the domain of any one nation; it belongs to and benefits all. But that common benefit relies upon a foundation of stability and peace.  Since the end of World War II, the United States and our military have played an indispensable role in helping create that foundation of security, allowing people, economies, and countries to rise, prosper, innovate, and win – first Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, then the nations of Southeast Asia, and now, yes, China and India.  Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted into the middle class. And in many nations, democracies have taken hold. America’s policy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific is about sustaining this progress and maintaining our pivotal role to ensure stability and prosperity in a changing region.  The U.S. Navy patrols the seas to ensure the free flow of commerce, as we have for generations, not only for the United States but for every nation.  We will also continue to forge stronger bonds between the nations of this critical region, including the bonds between our respective defense industries.  When we build things together, the bonds between nations grow stronger, and others can share the burden of common defense.  We’ll also continue to provide defense systems to friends and allies and train with them to advance the maritime security of all our nations – as we’re doing increasingly, as more Asia-Pacific nations, from India, through Vietnam to Japan are drawn to partner more with us.  And we’re investing in this in our budget too, with, for example, a $425-million Maritime Security Initiative for Southeast Asia. Now, to be clear, America’s efforts in this region have never been aimed at holding any nation back or pushing any country down.  The United States wants every nation to have the opportunity to rise and that includes China.  We welcome its rise and its inclusion in this architecture.  But we don’t welcome aggressive behavior. We all have a fundamental stake in the security of maritime Asia, including in the South China Sea.  Nearly 30 percent of the world’s maritime trade transits its waters annually, including approximately $1.2 trillion in shipping trade bound for the United States.  Like, you can see it; I saw it in the Strait of Malacca – amazing sight – when I was in Singapore a little while ago. That’s why the United States joins virtually every nation in the region in being deeply concerned about the artificial island construction and militarization in the South China Sea, including steps, especially by China, as it has taken most recently, by placing anti-access systems and military aircraft on a disputed island.  These activities have the potential to increase the risk of miscalculation and conflict among claimant states.  President Xi stated in Washington a few months ago that China would not do this.  China must not pursue militarization in the South China Sea.  Specific actions will have specific consequences. Indeed, while some in the region appear determined to play spoiler, the United States and our many friends in the region don’t plan on letting anyone upend seven decades’ worth of progress.  For our part, it should be clear that the U.S. military will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows there, as we do all around the world, because the maritime domain must always be open and free to all. To ensure the U.S. military’s continued ability to project power in the maritime domain around the world, our budget makes key investments in our naval strength.  One is in undersea capabilities, where we continue to dominate and where we’re investing over $8 billion just next year to ensure ours is the most lethal and most advanced undersea and anti-submarine force in the world – including by the way, with new undersea drones.  Another investment is of course our surface fleet, which in our budget grows both the number of ships and their capabilities to deter even the most advanced potential adversaries and protect the maritime security we all depend on.  All in all the rebalance has dedicated by far, the most, and the newest forces, of the United States to this region.  And more is coming. All of these military investments are necessary; they’re not sufficient.  Because security and prosperity are inextricably linked, so America must build on its growing political and economic engagement in the Asia-Pacific as well.  Most importantly, Congress must complete action on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement, or TPP.  I’ve said that from a strategic perspective, with respect to foreign policy, having TPP is as important to me as an aircraft carrier.  We cannot allow anything to undo this critical achievement.  It’s time to get this done. Now, as our military preserves freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce at sea, we are equally committed to the free flow of information and commerce online.  The Internet was created by DoD, academia, and industry working together.  And since then we’ve seen it enable boundless transformation and prosperity across all sectors of our society – making many things easier, cheaper, and safer. But as we’ve also seen in recent years, these same technologies present a degree of risk to the individual people and the businesses who rely on them every day – making it easier, cheaper and, so it seems, safer to threaten all that. Like so many Bay Area businesses, the Defense Department relies on networks heavily, which is why defending our networks and weapon systems is job one for the Department of Defense in cyberspace – they’re no good if they’ve been hacked.  DoD’s second mission in cyberspace is to help other agencies defend the nation against cyberattacks from abroad, especially if they would cause loss of life, property destruction, or significant foreign policy and economic consequences.  And the third mission is to provide offensive cyber options that can be used in a conflict, as we’re doing now against ISIL in Syria and Iraq. In the defense budget, we’re investing more in all three of these missions, a total of $35 billion over the next five years, with much, much more of this going to modernizing and securing DoD’s hundreds of networks.  Part of that goes toward building and training the Cyber Mission Forces, some of whom I’ll meet in Seattle later this week.  These are talented people – some active-duty, but also Reservists and National Guardsmen – who hunt down intruders, red-team our networks, and perform the forensics that help keep our systems secure.  And it’s just one way the American military is helping protect U.S. interests in cyberspace and preserve access to a free, open, and secure Internet, so businesses can continue to innovate and individuals can continue to interact without having to live under any threat. This is important, because the rules of the Internet, to the extent they exist, have always been a product of all its users.  They weren’t written or dictated by anyone.  They came out of garages, and dorm rooms, and home offices, and research laboratories.  In many ways, they still do, and are continuing to be shaped by individuals, including many here in the Bay Area. When it comes to the Internet, no one nation, no single entity has the authority to write all the rules for anyone else.  That’s not just my opinion; it’s the firm position of the Obama administration, which it has shown in recent trade negotiations, diplomacy, and decisions on net neutrality that the United States is a strong proponent of a free and open Internet. But here too, some nations seek to play spoiler.  China and Russia, for example, are pursuing a very different vision, one predicated on absolute government control of the Internet, anti-access policies like the “Great Firewall,” state-sponsored cyber theft, including theft of intellectual property, cyberespionage, and also cybercrime.  Just last week, China’s government further restricted foreign companies from publishing and distributing online content in China, and made it clear that state media would speak for the party’s will alone.  We’ve seen that China aims to, as one news headline put it last [year], quote, “Rewrite the rules of the global Internet,” end quote – limiting the access of their 1 billion-plus citizens to an open society.  China has also indicated an intent to require backdoors to all new technologies, potentially forcing the world to operate and innovate on China’s terms.  That’s not right. Clearly this approach is contrary to the values we share as a nation here in the United States.  So let me take a moment to tell you where the United States government and the United States Department of Defense stand on this issue.  We share the same underlying objectives and values as America’s technology community – and we believe in living the values we defend in the Department of Defense.  We believe we all have a stake in protecting intellectual property, and making sure the Internet remains free, open, secure, and prosperous.  And that means we must continue to respect, and protect the freedoms of expression, association, and privacy that reflect who we are as a nation. As Secretary of Defense, my mission is ensuring our military can defend our country and make a better world.  And DoD is at its best when it has the best partners.  Knowing how we’ve worked together in the past with those of you in the innovative tech sector, and how critical your work is to our country, strengthening that partnership is very important to me.  And I’m glad that we’ve started to make real progress on that over the last year. We always want America’s best contributing to our national security, and for it to be a two-way street.  There’s a lot we can learn from each other on better securing our networks and defending against emerging cyber threats.  Getting it right depends on getting the right people, which is why we’re creating new ways to bring talent from the technology community into DoD, even if only for a time, a year or two, a project, so they can help us do better.  An example of this is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community to help solve some of our most complex problems.  And I brought its leader, Chris Lynch, out here with me.  Chris, stand up and wave.  Before Chris came here – great guy – before Chris came to us to help us, he was a serial entrepreneur here in the tech world, also worked at Microsoft.  He’s recruited in – in this role for me – he’s recruited coders from places like Google, and Palantir, and Shopify for a tour of duty – we call it a tour of duty here at – back in DoD.  And he’s done such a good job of cutting through red tape, he even figured out how to get away with wearing a hoodie every day in the Pentagon.  That’s what he looks like. We want people like Chris to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking – and hopefully that infusion of innovative, entrepreneurial spirit will rub off on us, and help sustain and strengthen the bridges we’re building with the tech community for many years to come.  I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow. I know the issue of data security, including encryption, has been a hot topic here in the Bay Area and around the country.  There are limits on what I can say about the case that’s been in the news lately – I’m sure you know which one I’m talking about – particularly because it’s under litigation and it’s a law enforcement matter.  So let me speak more broadly, because this is one of the most complicated challenges of our time. First, it’s important to take a step back here, because future policy shouldn’t be driven by any one particular case. Second, encryption is a necessary part of data security, and strong encryption is a good thing.  DoD is the largest user of encryption in the world, principally because our troops need it.  It helps keep our fighter jets and our sensor networks from getting hacked.  It allows us to surprise our adversaries.  And it lets our people deployed around the world communicate securely with their families back home – from sailors aboard aircraft carriers to soldiers in Afghanistan.  For all these reasons, we need our data security and encryption to be as strong as possible. Third, as we together – together – engineer approaches to overall human security in the information age, I know enough about technology to recognize that there will not be some simple, overall technical approach, including the so-called back door. The bottom line is that the tech community and policymakers need to work together to solve these complex challenges, just like they have in the past.  Future technology will only grow more complicated.  And in this global marketplace, failing to work together would risk letting others set the standard on their terms and according to their values – and that wouldn’t be consistent with our values, and it wouldn’t be good for U.S. businesses either. The right way is partnership.  It’s easy to see the wrong ways to go about this.  One would be a law hastily written in anger or grief.  Another would be to have the rules written by Russia or China. That’s why the Department of Defense will continue seeking to work with Bay Area companies – because we’re living in the same world, with the same basic trends and the same basic threats.  And we must innovate the way forward together. Meanwhile, as we work together to protect the free flow of commerce at sea and online, we must also recognize the opportunities and the threats to the free and open domain of outer space. Many companies in this community are now exploring the frontiers of this domain and nearly every business depends on it to some extent, even if for just things such as communications and GPS.  In DoD, we rely on it just as much, and we have for quite some time.  From secure communications, to reconnaissance satellites, to allowing for precise navigation and targeting, space is integral to our operations.  Indeed, space enables great things here on Earth for security and prosperity – from financial companies with global presence, to the remote street vendor conducting business with a satellite phone.  GPS, first developed in partnership with the Defense Department and maintained for decades including up to this day by us, is now woven into every aspect of our lives – from hailing a car service on the Embarcadero, to finding and targeting terrorists in the Middle East.  All that.  And decades ago, we pioneered space together, you and us.  It was the innovation of this region that led to the cutting-edge satellites that have quite literally changed how we see the world today. Today, many companies are going into space now on their own, with ambitions for greater commercial imaging, micro-satellites, even aspirations for tourism.  Just as government-led efforts in space have benefited both our security and our society, private-led efforts are doing so also – one recent example being that the public disclosure of China’s surface-to-air missiles in the South China Sea was due to being discovered in commercial satellite imagery. However, this emerging marketplace is leading to a reemerging challenge.  Space can get crowded, particularly with many companies and many nations seeking to operate there in ways we’ve never seen so many do before – including some that can pose threats to safe global order in space. To give you just one example of the dangers we would face if space turned from universal benefit to unrestricted battlefield, consider the longevity of space debris, which can cause great harm if it impacts a satellite or a spacecraft.  When a Chinese anti-satellite test destroyed a defunct weather satellite in 2007, it dispersed over 3,000 pieces of debris, expanding the amount orbiting the Earth – the total amount – by 15 percent in one moment.  The remnants of that satellite are still there, and they’ll be there for over a century, just as 100 years after the Battle of Verdun, French farmers still encounter unexploded ordnance in their fields.  A kinetic battle in space could leave behind a legacy that would last far longer, and make this common domain hazardous for commercial applications for generations.  And make no mistake, both Russia and China have developed just such anti-satellite systems. Just like with the maritime and cyber domains, therefore, it’s in the self-interest of every nation to advance the common interest of free and stable environment in space. While in the past some may have thought of space as a sanctuary, DoD must now prepare for, and seek to prevent, the possibility of a conflict that extends into space, and we are.  In our budget, we’re continuing to invest more in space, totaling more than $22 billion [in 2017], including with investments to enhance our ability to identify, attribute, and negate threatening actions by others. DoD has a responsibility to protect its assets and interests in space, and to ensure this domain remains available for both security and commercial applications.  This too will require working together more with the private sector.  We know that.  Commercial space needs must be considered and protected to realize the continuing promise of this remarkable domain, and the only way to do that is through effective partnership and communication, once again. We believe strong rules of the road that grow out of the commercial and civil interest in space will benefit all nations.  They will propel American space entrepreneurship, which directly benefits national security, and they will allow us to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in space. Let me close with a reminder about how much we’ve done together to shape the world in each of the three domains I’ve discussed – the sea, cyberspace, and outer space – because in many ways, we don’t think of it enough. When someone orders an iPhone, they buy a device that brilliantly harnesses breakthrough technologies that were seeded by DoD and government investments, from multi-touch to iOS’s Siri.  Chances are, they order it using the Internet that DoD, industry, and academia helped create together.  The phone gets packaged in Asia, then shipped over an ocean our Navy patrols to ensure that that shipping goes unimpeded.  And it’s tracked from start to finish by GPS technology, which DoD could not have invented or launched without a robust, innovative private sector. DoD’s fundamental promise is to protect U.S. citizens and our interests, but we’re most proud of providing the foundation of security that underpins global stability and prosperity.  That’s why the partnership between the Department of Defense and this community is so important. It’s true that because we have different missions and somewhat different perspectives, sometimes we’ll disagree – and I think that’s okay.  Because whether we’re developing a new product or a new policy, the lesson to me is always the same: vigorous debate and exchange produce breakthrough ideas. My pledge to you is this: you will always have strong and willing partner in America’s Department of Defense.  You can count on your military, the finest fighting force the world has ever known, to do its part so that you can continue to innovate and excel with us for generations to come. Thank you. ","Remarks on “Securing the Oceans, the Internet, and Space: Protecting the Domains that Drive Prosperity” (The Commonwealth Club of California)",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/684118/remarks-on-securing-the-oceans-the-internet-and-space-protecting-the-domains-th/
"June 24, 2016"," Chairman Dunford, Secretary James, elected officials, friends and family, members of the Air Force family and our broader DOD family -- past, present, future -- privileged to be here today, as we honor one of our most appreciated and accomplished military leaders and his family. For General Mark Welsh, his family has provided him a critical foundation, starting, of course, with his wife, Betty, [and] four wonderful children: Mark, John, Matt and Elizabeth all here today.  And we're so grateful for them.  They've provided Mark the support and flexibility he's needed to answer his country's call repeatedly and to lead missions of incredible difficulty. Some of those missions took place closer to home than others.  Indeed, as a proud Air Force father, perhaps one of Mark's biggest tests came when his son Matt said the following five words, ""Dad, I'm becoming a Marine."" As always, Mark adjusted, of course, and frankly, there are few indications of General Welsh's personal success than the decision of two of his children to follow in his footsteps, to serve in the military and pursue the noblest of callings.  It's an honor to be in the presence of a family where selfless service and commitment to country mean so much. Now, for those of us who work in the Pentagon, we see the Air Force Memorial every day. It's natural for us to focus on its three spires and the separate paths they take to the sky; the artist’s rendition of the Thunderbird’s “high bomb burst” maneuver is what first strikes the eye. But as General Welsh explains, you have to see the Memorial from its foundation to appreciate its full meaning, because supporting the three rising spires is a solid granite base.  And inscribed into the Memorial's foundation are the words that comprise the Air Force's foundation, the core values of this proud service: “integrity first, service before self, excellence in all we do.” Those are powerful words.  And Mark has made it his mission to model them and make them the North Star for airmen.  He stressed that only when airmen of every rank and occupation specialty come together around these values can the Air Force deliver the global vigilance, global reach and global power that our nation requires. Mark has said he first joined the Air Force because he fell in the love with airplanes and wanted to fly, but that he stayed in the Air Force because he fell in love with the people; he fell in love with the idea of the Air Force and what its people stood for and provided their nation. I'm sure many of you have seen Mark interact with our airmen.  You've seen the dignity and respect he affords each and every one, creates an incredibly powerful bond between them. When he speaks to Academy and ROTC cadets, or the airmen at an Air Force Base, Mark often calls upon the youngest or most experienced among them to come forward.  Bringing this young man or woman to the front is a great honor, but it's also a challenge. ""Which of us is more important to the Air Force, me or you?"" Mark will ask them.  And that's a tough question and it can take a couple minutes for Mark to get the right response.  But he always leads them to the right answer that each and every airman is as important as any other. Now, to be sure, this has been no easy time.  Our airmen have been enduring threats of sequestration, they've managed an insatiable demand for air power across combatant commands, they've served and sacrificed in two wars.  Through it all, our airmen have performed magnificently.  Under General Welsh's leadership, they've innovated, they've adapted, they've built upon the best traditions and core values of our Air Force Mark's own career prepared him to inspire airmen to break with traditional approaches and career paths.  He's flown the F- 16 and the A-10, among others.  He's held positions of command in Europe and in Asia.  He spent years as both a fighter pilot and an intelligence officer.  And most recently, as Chief of Staff, General Welsh has enabled our Air Force to thrive over these last four years. Many of us, and certainly I, have seen this up close in so many different ways.  We see it in how he has made the Air Force more responsive to war time needs to deliver better, rapid support to our warfighters.  We've seen it in how he has ensured the Air Force made smart investments in key modernization efforts, including the B-21 long- range striker bomber, KC-46 refueling tanker, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter – game-changing platforms that will allow us to continue our air dominance well into this century.  And we've seen it in how he has led the Air Force in responding to challenges all over the world: That's the kind of global impact that Mark has helped enable for our Air Force.  And he has had a similar impact across the functions of the Air Force – re-energizing critical enterprises, like electronic warfare, cyber, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, and the Air Force's nuclear enterprise. General Welsh has been an instrumental leader in putting our most sophisticated electronic jammers onto the Air Force's most in-demand aircraft, and helping prioritize cyber defense is job one for our military in cyber space. And making sure we're taking care of the airmen who fly, fix and operate our fleet of remotely piloted aircraft, and in reversing decades of under investment in our nuclear deterrent, which is the bedrock of our security. All of this was able to happen because, as Mark worked tirelessly to meet current demands over the past four years, he never lost sight of the needs of the next four years, or the next 40 years. That kind of strategic foresight is, and will continue to be essential, not only for the Air Force, but the entire Department of Defense, particularly in a world where the challenges we face are increasingly trans-regional and trans-functional.  And here, too, Mark's impact has been critical. One of Mark's great legacies as leader has come from his skill as an integrator, both within the Air Force and across our joint force.  Since Mark became Chief-of-Staff, the Air Force's ISR, electronic warfare and cyber components have been completely transformed in how they work.  While we can't discuss all of the different ways he has integrated the operations of the 25th and 24th Air Forces, for example, we can say that when an electronic warfare platform like the EC-130 plays a leading role in our cyber enterprise today, you can get a glimpse of one small part of Mark's legacy. And of course, many of the innovations he has driven forward extend well beyond the Air Force. Look at the Army pods now fixed to the wings of Air Force Reapers, or the Air Force and Navy's partnership on jamming improvised explosive devices. These are just two of the joint force collaborations he has championed.  And for years to come, American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines will be safer because of them. Now, Mark's expertise here isn't surprising.  After all, many of Mark's accomplishments over the past decade were not only in the Air Force, not only in the Pentagon, but in integrating America's defense and intelligence missions as Associate Director of the CIA. As his distinguished service citation from the Agency reads, “He led unprecedented Central Intelligence Agency support to globally deployed U.S. military assets at a time of unparalleled operations tempo.” Most of us in this hangar will be long gone before the full story of Mark achieved for our security is told, but this we do know. Ever since Mark's tour at the Agency, he's put the art of the possible at the center of answering every challenge. If he hears that we can't do something a certain way or we've never done it that way before, that's just simply not a response he'll accept.  When I talk about the importance for us at the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box, Mark is one leader who has shown why it's so critical to do so for our future. That's an aspect of Mark's leadership I've greatly appreciated as Secretary. He always brings solutions to the table that are forward-looking, practical and sustainable.  I've seen firsthand how his innovative thinking and leadership has benefited not only our airmen, but also the marine in Anbar, soldier in Kunar, sailor in the Pacific. And I've also benefited personally from his most incisive inputs on key initiatives – from building the Force of the Future that will help defend our nation in generations to come, to building bridges with America's innovative technology community so our military continues to stay the best, to opening all combat positions to women so that we can take advantage of our country's entire pool of population for our all-volunteer force.  Indeed, each of us here today and citizens across this nation are indebted to Mark for us four decades of distinguished service. And make no mistake, by the way Mark leads and services, you can tell he's enjoyed the journey. You can tell how much he loves the people of this military and the nation they serve.  He cherishes the security they provide together so that men and women across the country, and indeed, across the world can go to school, go to work, raise their children, live their lives, dream their dreams.  It's the love of his love and inspiration, his wife Betty, who's done so much to make this success possible. If there's one person in the Air Force family who's embraced each new challenge with an open mind and each new community with a generous heart, it's Betty Welsh.  At a time when so much has been asked of our airmen, when so many have spent so many tours away from home, Betty's compassion has helped sustain the force. As she said, “a key spouse can reach out to every spouse in the squadron – every family.”  For dozens of communities and thousands of families, Betty's been that key spouse. She's been there for families at their times of greatest need.  And she's made the Air Force a family for so many. Betty, you've sacrificed greatly for these many years.  We owe you and your entire family a tremendous debt of gratitude.  I know you and Mark are looking forward to spending some more time together and I want you to both know that Stephanie and I and the entire Defense Department family wish you and your family the very best. Today, we know that the standard General Welsh has set for this service – to constantly learn, adapt and prepare for a world of varied current challenges and uncertain future challenges, but also bright opportunities for the great nation that is America – will soon be carried forward under the proven leadership and strategic vision of his successor, General Dave Goldfein.  And we know that the values and traditions of excellence in innovations, which have allowed the United States to dominate the first aerospace century, will surely guide the Air Force to do that in the next. Because of General Mark Welsh, because of the commitment of the family that supported him, because of the excellence of airmen who have served under him, the United States Air Force is better prepared to fly, fight and win than at any time in history.  Across the many missions we ask our Air Force to complete, across the many domains we ask them to dominate, the foundations of this proud service are stronger than ever before.  And to General Welsh –  for all this –  for your strong and steady leadership, for your selfless service to this country, for your commitment to our airmen, to their families and to our entire force, Mark – we thank you.

"Aug. 15, 2015","To the families – the families of Gunnery Sergeant Sullivan, Staff Sergeant Wyatt, Sergeant Holmquist, Petty Officer Smith, and Lance Corporal Wells:  To you, it is with heavy hearts that Stephanie and I join you this afternoon.  We have no words for what you feel today because try as we may, and try as we do, we can never fully know.  But we do know what the lives of your loved ones meant to the security of our country, and we will never forget. Vice President Biden, you honor the force with your presence today, as you do so often.  Secretary Mabus, Admiral Greenert, General Dunford; Governor Haslam; Mayor Berke; distinguished members of Congress; guests; ladies and gentlemen: As we gather today, we cannot erase the pain of our loss, but still we come together as fellow citizens to honor these five fallen patriots.  To mourn with those who loved them.  To provide comfort and healing as best we can.  To remember the lives these brave men led.  To reflect on the meaning their lives have for us, the duty their deaths impose upon us. Their lives were truly exemplary.  Many of them served abroad, and fought on the front lines of faraway battlefields in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.  And here at home, they were serving among the many men and women in uniform who represent our military communities – in communities across the country, on the front lines of the force of the future. The meaning of their lives is therefore clear – crystal clear – and we will forever be proud of them. The meaning of their killing is yet unclear, and what combination of disturbed mind, violent extremism, and hateful ideology was at work, we don’t know.  Perhaps it will never be fully known, let alone fathomable, by all who have the decency and conscience to value their fellow human beings. But we do know this: We know that we will do what it takes to protect the service men and women who protect us.  This is something we – all of us – me, President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary Mabus, General Dunford, Admiral Greenert, all the men and women of the Department of Defense – this is something we take personally.  That is why I’ve directed the military services to fundamentally review their domestic security procedures as well as to take immediate steps to improve the security and force protection of our personnel.  And we will do more if necessary. We also know that we are the many, the just, the noble, and that the few who threaten or incite harm to Americans – violent extremists or terrorists, wherever they are – will surely, very surely, no matter how long it takes, come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice. And we know that those who attempt to inspire fear or terror will find no satisfaction, have no success, in the United States of America.  Instead, we come back – we come back from tragedy – stronger and more united than before. Because across America, our reserve facilities and recruiting centers are still open.  Young men and women are still signing up to serve and defend their country.  They will carry forward the legacy of the fallen, and like them, they too will serve in the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Even here in this great city, Chattanooga, Tennessee, recruits are still lining up to volunteer – in some cases, more than they were before. In fact, one future sailor named Alexis enlisted just last week.  She’d been talking to recruiters in Chattanooga before the shooting, but this senseless violence only made her want to serve her country more.  It only strengthened her resolve to stand up against fear and hatred.  As she said the other day, “We’re not going to let one incident destroy us. … We’re all standing strong – as a community and as a whole.” That’s the spirit – the spirit of Chattanooga, the spirit of Tennessee, and the spirit of America and its military.  That’s how we heal – by standing strong together. So to the Sullivan family, the Wyatt family, the Holmquist family, the Smith family, and the Wells family – you’re part of our family, our military family.  And you always will be.  Your strength and sacrifice will continue to guide us, inspire us, and remain with us forever and ever. May God hold close and grant peace to the souls of those who no longer live with us, but will live on within us. May God watch over the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who continue to defend us all. And may God continue to bless this great nation, the United States of America.

"May 16, 2015","As our nation marks its 65th annual Armed Forces Day, we are reminded why our men and women in uniform comprise the finest fighting force the world has ever known. They not only continue to defend our country with unmatched skill and devotion; they also help make a better and more peaceful world for our children. Today we are especially mindful of the nearly 200,000 servicemembers currently beyond our shores protecting America’s interests. They are standing for our shared values in Europe against those who would turn back the clock. They are standing with our friends and allies against savagery in the Middle East. In the Asia-Pacific – where new powers rise, old tensions still simmer, and half of humanity resides – they are responding to disasters and standing up for a continuation of the decades-long miracle of development and progress underwritten by the United States. And in cyberspace, they are standing with those who create and innovate against those who seek to steal, destroy, and exploit. To the more than 2 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen who defend the United States of America – we thank you and your families for answering the call to serve. Know that DoD’s senior leaders and I are as committed as ever to safeguarding you, to ensuring you’re treated with dignity and respect, and, above all, to ensuring that when you’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care. Today, and every day, we are grateful for what you do. ",Armed Forces Day Message,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606671/armed-forces-day-message/
"March 31, 2016","What a magnificent institution: UT.  And I want to thank President, Fenves who long before he assumed the leadership of this great public university, was an accomplished technologist and engineer.  All the students here who have joined us today, thank you for your engagement and interest in subjects that matter to your future and our security. This morning I met with my long-time friend, Bill McRaven, your Chancellor, who, as you probably know, was once a four-star Admiral and Navy SEAL.  Bill is one of his generation’s most influential Naval officers.  In some ways, you could say his innovative spirit – and his enduring commitment to service – helps to embody the highest ideals of this university. Of course, two years ago, Bill gave a Commencement Address heard ‘round the world.  He proudly proclaimed this University’s motto, and no, I’m not talking about what he said about making your bed every morning.  I’m talking about how Bill proudly declared that “What starts here changes the world.”  And just by being on campus this morning, I’ve seen some of what you’re doing to make a better reality. After my visit with Bill, I stopped by UT’s School of Social Work.  And there, I met an impressive group of researchers who are tackling something that’s important to us, that I’ll just mention to you, I was very impressed with the work there, and that’s the scourge of sexual assault across the UT system.  Which is, on university campuses, particularly offensive to us in the profession of arms and we’re determined to beat it. But I learned a lot and had an excellent exchange of information and ideas and I’m grateful to the people I was with earlier this morning.  And there’s a point also in that which is whether we are members of a prestigious academic community like this one, or part of a proud and noble institution like our Department of Defense, we encounter similar challenges.  And we should share a common commitment: to create an environment where everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and we can get the best out of people. Now, additionally, later this afternoon, I’ll visit an advanced computing center and tour a laboratory where scientists and engineers are making advances in neuromuscular robotics, advanced data sciences, and other fields.  So just in one day, I’m seeing how determined people are here at UT are to think differently and to deliver solutions to some of our most complex challenges. Every day, we are challenging ourselves to do the same at the Department of Defense.  We have to, given the complex and multiple threats we face; not just ISIL, which we will defeat, but also North Korea, which is among others, firing ballistic missiles, Russia, which is among other things, illegally annexing Crimea, China attempting to change the calculus in the South China Sea, and Iran continuing to export malign influence.  We need the best talent America has to offer to meet these challenges and carry forward our responsibilities. As Secretary of Defense, I have the privilege of leading the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  But that’s not a birthright, that’s not a guarantee. We have to earn it again and again.   And I have to pass it on to those who come after me so that they have the same privilege I have. And to ensure that the force of tomorrow remains as great as the force of today, we in the Pentagon are needing to think, as I tell our folks, outside our five-sided box about the kinds of solutions and the kinds of careers and the kinds of challenges and the kinds of opportunities that will make the very best, like those represented in this room, continue to join our great institution. And I’m proud that so many of you sitting in front of me have already made a decision to be part of this enterprise, which, to me, is the noblest thing you can do.  To the large number of ROTC Cadets with us today, I look forward to welcoming you one day as members of our Department of Defense community. What you have chosen is consequential, makes a great difference – helping to defend one’s country and build a better world. There’s nothing better to wake up to than being part of that mission. And pretty soon you’ll be assuming the awesome responsibilities of leadership – the responsibility of ensuring that our citizens, as well as men and women across the world, have the security they need to dream their dreams, raise their families, live lives that are full. That’s what it’s all about. And whether you are part of ROTC or not, whether you’re a senior or a sophomore, you might be wondering what the world you’ll be entering into.  And there’s no question about it: you are living during a time of incredible change and challenge in a lot of parts of the world. Every time you turn on the television, or surf the internet, it seems there’s some new reason to be apprehensive about the world that awaits you.  And when you see the kind of horrendous attacks ISIL carried out in Brussels, you might ask yourself what you can do—I hope you might ask yourself what can do you do—how you can make a difference, how you can be a part of something bigger than yourself. And its’ a world of opportunities, too: wonderful, bright opportunities to leave a better world for future generations. Now, I admit that I didn’t think much about national security when I was where you are.  I was all wrapped up in physics, history, separately by the way, although the joke people make about me is that I’m now living the perfect marriage of physics and medieval things, sports.  But that changed a few years later when I listened to a speech about the future of technology in the military.  It helped me realize that I could make a difference—that I knew something—I could make a difference, and it would be in something of great consequence. Those of you in ROTC are preparing to become warriors, but like all students here today, you’re also scientists, programmers, writers, mathematicians, social scientists, and so much more.  Every day each of you helps to crack the code in some way, and we need you to keep doing so, so that American retains its great strength as an incubator of ideas and innovation. Because that, second only to our people, is what makes our military the greatest. For those of you who won’t be going into the military but may want to advance our mission and keep our nation secure, we’re committed to finding additional opportunities for you to make a contribution. One year and one day ago – barely a month after I became Secretary of Defense – I went to my old high school in Philadelphia, and I laid out my commitment to building the Force of the Future - the all-volunteer force, because that’s what we have, that will defend our country in future generations.  Part of the reforms and investments we are making in that Force of the Future involve finding ways for more of our citizens – including students like you either in uniform or in some other way– to contribute to our mission.  In fact, a critical part of building the Force of the Future starts with what we’re doing for students like you, to improve and enhance our internship programs, to make them more effective at transitioning promising interns into productive professionals at the Department of Defense. That’s how we get good people in, get them to give us a try, and when they do that, many of them find that the meaning of being part of our mission, as I found, not too much older than you were, that they could not resist being a part of . As part of the Force of the Future, we’re also bringing in more of America’s best and most innovative minds to the Pentagon.  That’s why we have created the Defense Digital Service, to bring in expertise from America’s technology community just to work for a specific time, or on a specific project.  Maybe some of the computer science majors here can come on board for a few months or for a few specific projects.  Perhaps they can even wear a hoodie, like Chris Lynch, the Director of the Defense Technical Service. Where are you Chris? There’s Chris back there. The only person in the Pentagon who wears a hoodie every day, but he runs our Defense Digital Service, which is just what it says, which is people like Chris who are able to come in and work for a time, and that’s OK, and even if they only come in for a time, and go back out again, and come back in again, it’s a tremendous source for us of fresh ideas. And for them, it’s a tremendous opportunity to contribute to this great mission. As we’ve introduced reforms and investments to build this force of the future, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  We’re not a business. We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows everyone else – all of you and your parents and your friends and your fellow citizens – to go to school, go to work, and to one day, provide a better future for the next generation. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can, should, and are borrowing practices, technologies, and management techniques that work for us, so that in future generations, we keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. We’re making these investments and pushing forward with these reforms for one simple reason: so that the force of tomorrow can remain as strong as the force of today.  And to make that possible, we need more talented and dedicated people like you, men and women who are committed to making creative and lasting contributions to our national defense. The opportunities you’ve had here at the University of Texas, those opportunities will soon become your obligations.  In a short period of time, you’ll have to put your talents and skills to some productive and practical use.  And I have complete confidence in your ability to make the most of your world-class education.  In fact, there may be a future Bill McRaven among the ROTC cadets in the audience, or a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, or perhaps a future Secretary of Defense. ",Remarks before Fireside Chat at the University of Texas,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/711095/remarks-before-fireside-chat-at-the-university-of-texas/
"May 30, 2015","Well, thank you, John, thanks for that kind introduction.  Thank you for sponsoring this remarkable forum.  Over its history, IISS has hosted invaluable conversations like Shangri-La Dialogue and produced important scholarship.  And through all of that, you’ve made our world more secure.  On behalf of the United States, thank you. One reason I’ve enjoyed coming to this Dialogue since attending it for the first time, as John noted, in 2002 is the opportunity to visit with so many good friends…the United States has in this region.  On my way to Southeast Asia, I attended a change-of-command ceremony the U.S. Pacific Command…in Hawaii and there I met with the Philippines’ National Defense Secretary Gazmin.  And when I arrived in Singapore, I had the opportunity to visit with Prime Minister Lee, who gave a characteristically wise and incisive keynote last night, and with Minister Ng to talk about regional challenges and a deepening defense relationship. Of course, I see so many friends and partners here today, and I’ll meet with many of you after these sessions.  From Singapore, I will travel to Vietnam with visits in Haiphong and then Hanoi, where Vietnamese Defense Minister General Thanh and I will sign a Joint Vision Statement commit to do so.  And then I will fly on to India to tour the Eastern Naval Command at Visag and meet with my counterpart in New Delhi to sign the new U.S.-India Defense Framework that will guide military cooperation between us for the next decade. Each of these stops, just like my visits to Japan and the Republic of Korea last month, is a reminder of the regional demand for persistent American engagement and the importance of the regional security architecture that has helped so many Asia-Pacific nations to rise and prosper. And that’s the theme of my remarks today: the United States wants a shared regional architecture that is strong enough, capable enough, and connected enough to ensure that all Asia-Pacific peoples and nations have the opportunity to rise – and continue to rise – in the future.  The United States wants a future in which an Indonesian fisherman, an energy executive from Malaysia, an entrepreneur from Singapore, a small business owner in California, and a Chinese businesswoman – just to name a few – have the security and opportunity to rise and prosper.  And the United States wants to protect the rights of all countries, whether large or small, to win…to rise, to prosper and to determine their own destiny. To realize that future, the Asia-Pacific’s security architecture must be inclusive, it must be open, and it must be transparent.  It must respect rights, and not just might.  It cannot shy away from the hard issues…it must provide a forum to openly discuss the challenges we face, so that we can tackle them collectively.  It must be action-oriented to help us manage today’s challenges and prevent tomorrow’s crises.  And it must reward cooperation, not coercion. That’s an audacious idea, but we meet today in a country that demonstrates what determination, consistency, and persistence can do, though we do so with heavy hearts.  Lee Kuan Yew once said that, quote, “Anybody who thinks he is a statesman needs to see a psychiatrist,” but the world lost a great friend and indeed one of its premier statesmen with his passing earlier this year.  Lee Kuan Yew’s spirit of statesmanship endures, perhaps nowhere more than in this room. Here men and women of goodwill come together to think critically about the region’s future.  We owe it to Lee Kuan Yew – who described his leadership style as, quote, “I set out to do something.  I keep on chasing it until it succeeds”– and we owe it to all those we represent – citizens, organizations, governments, and businesses – to work together until we succeed…until every nation can rise...and everybody wins.  That’s the future we all need to keep chasing. We’ve succeeded before.  Over the past 70 years, the Asia-Pacific has grown and prospered in so many ways…Miracle after miracle has occurred:  first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, including Singapore, rose and prospered, and now, China and India are rising and prospering. And the region is not done yet.  Today, over 60 percent of the world’s population lives in the Asia-Pacific.  It’s the fulcrum of the global economy, one of the fastest growing regions of the world.  That sustained growth – supported by increased regional and international trade – has lifted millions out of poverty and into the middle class.  And even though there’s still room for improvement, democracy and freedom have spread throughout the region. Meanwhile, the United States is doing well too.   Following the worst recession since the Great Depression, the U.S. economy has made great gains – in both jobs and GDP.  Progress will continue because of America’s dynamic and innovative businesses, strong commitment to the rule of law, world-class universities, and the domestic energy revolution now underway.  And the U.S. military, long the finest fighting force the world has ever known, has improved its readiness while maintaining its unmatched operational edge and unrivaled capabilities. America’s so-called rebalance has always been about sustaining the progress occurring all around the Asia-Pacific and helping the region continue to fulfill its promise.  As Secretary of Defense, I am personally committed to its next phase, in which DoD will deepen long-standing alliances and partnerships, diversify America’s force posture, and make new investments in key capabilities and platforms.  The Department is investing in the technologies that are most relevant to this complex security environment, such as new unmanned systems for the air and sea, a new long-range bomber, and new technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for space and cyberspace, including a few surprising ones. As the United States develops new systems, DoD will continue to bring the best platforms and people forward to the Asia-Pacific, such as the latest Virginia-class submarines, the Navy's P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, the newest stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, and brand-new carrier-based E-2D Hawkeye early-warning-and-control aircraft. But the rebalance’s next phase is more than just about security.  The United States is increasing economic and diplomatic engagement.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, or TPP, just passed an important milestone in the U.S. Congress, and when it’s completed, it will unlock tremendous economic opportunities, not only for the United States, but for countries across the Pacific Rim.  It will create a diverse network of trade and investment relations driven by TPP’s high standards, reducing reliance on any one network.  Diplomatically, Secretary Kerry and other members of the Cabinet are making frequent visits to the region and hosting many of their counterparts this year.  President Obama will meet a number of Asian leaders at the White House before travelling here again in November. The entire Obama Administration and many others in Washington – both Republican and Democrat – are devoted to the rebalance.  The rebalance enjoys strong, bipartisan support in Congress, as you can see from the large and distinguished Congressional delegation joining me here today.  Senator McCain, Senator Reed, Senator Hirono, Senator Ernst, Senator Gardner, Senator Sullivan have been and will continue to be leaders on this important national effort. That’s because, for decade upon decade, regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican presidencies, in time of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has stood with its allies and partners here and helped maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific.  And the United States always will. It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance– and our overall and long-standing strategy to promote an Asia-Pacific regional security architecture where everyone rises – has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down.  The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, and prosper, and win…because it’s good for the region and good for all our countries. Indeed, as countries across the Asia-Pacific rise – as nations develop, as military spending increases, and as economies thrive – we expect to see changes in how countries define and pursue their interests and ambitions. In addition to those changes, we’ve seen the region’s complex security environment become more fraught.  North Korea continues to provoke.  Decades-long disputes over rocks and shoals are compounded by quarrels over fishing rights, energy resources, and freedom of access to international waters and airspace.  As the challenge of climate change looms larger, natural disasters not only threaten lives, but also upset trade and economic growth.  And at the same time, terrorism, foreign fighters, cyberattacks, and trafficking in both people and narcotics plague this region like any other. These challenges risk upsetting the positive trajectory we’ve all been on…and the rise of so many in the Asia-Pacific.  That can make it hard to remember our common interests, but the progress we’ve made, and must continue, demands that we do so. Unlike elsewhere in the world, the peace in Asia-Pacific has never been maintained by a region-wide alliance like NATO in Europe.  And that made sense for the Asia-Pacific, with its unique history, geography, and politics.  Instead, regional peace, stability, and security here have required all of our nations coming together behind shared interests. We must continue to come together.  Today and in the years ahead, security must be the shared responsibility of all us, of all our nations.  With the strengthening of the East Asia Summit, we have the foundation for a stronger architecture.  It’s incumbent upon all of us to make it better…by reaffirming our long-standing rules and norms, strengthening our institutions, modernizing alliances, enhancing capabilities, and improving connectivity.  As President Obama said in Brisbane last year, an effective security order for Asia must be based – not on spheres of influence, or coercion, or intimidation where big nations bully the small – but on alliances of mutual security, international law and international norms, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. First, we must all reaffirm the guiding principles and the rules that have served this region so well.  Disputes should be resolved peacefully…through diplomacy, not aggression or intimidation.  All countries should have the right to freedom of navigation and overflight so global commerce can continue unimpeded.  And all nations should be able to make their own security and economic choices free from coercion. These are the rights of all nations.  They are not abstractions, and nor are they subject to the whims of any one country.  They are not privileges to be granted or withdrawn by any country.  These rules make sense: they’ve worked, and they can continue to help all our nations to rise – as long as we reinforce them instead of putting them at risk. Second, we must strengthen regional institutions.  The nations of ASEAN have laid the foundation for the architecture in Southeast Asia that we enjoy today, and ASEAN will continue to be central to it. That’s why the United States and the Department of Defense are making an affirmative investment of time, resources, and engagement in ASEAN.  That’s why America has committed to sending a new U.S. Defense Advisor to augment the U.S. Mission to ASEAN in order to improve coordination and information sharing for humanitarian and disaster response and for maritime security.  That’s also why I plan to travel to Malaysia in November for this year’s ADMM-Plus meeting, As ASEAN works to build its community in the years ahead, the United States encourages member countries to continue to seek out new and innovative ways to work together and pool resources to maintain regional security. Third, America’s alliances and partnerships have been the bedrock of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades. And the United States is working with allies like Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines to be sure all our alliances continue to serve this vital function.  Modernization means changing these alliances to address the evolving threat environment as the United States has done with South Korea and growing those alliances into platforms for regional and global cooperation, as we’ve done with Australia and Japan. Under Prime Minister Abe, Japan is increasing its engagement in Southeast Asia.  Through the recently updated Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, the United States and Japan will be able to do more as an alliance in the region and beyond.  Forward-stationing America’s most advanced capabilities in Japan – such as the Global Hawk long-range surveillance drone, AEGIS ballistic-missile-defense destroyers, and the recently announced CV…CV-22 Osprey – will further enable rapid and allied responses to regional contingencies. Meanwhile the U.S.-Korea alliance not only assures deterrence and stability on the Korean Peninsula; it increasingly works for the region as well.  And…and in Australia, U.S. and Australian forces now train side-by-side not only with each other as they have for many years, but also with friends and partners across Southeast Asia. Beyond alliances, the United States is also deepening its partnerships with friends across the region, including India, and Vietnam, where, as I said, I will travel next week.  The United States is looking for new ways to complement India’s Act East policy and find meaningful areas of cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.  And the 2015 U.S.-India Defense Framework I will sign next week will open up this relationship on everything from maritime security to aircraft carrier and jet engine technology cooperation. We’re leveraging America’s alliances and partnerships to pursue…new forms of cooperation and that is why America’s trilateral networks are blossoming.  With Japan and Australia, the United States is strengthening maritime security in Southeast Asia, expanding trilateral exercises, and exploring defense technology cooperation.  With Japan and Korea, the United States is building on a first-of-its-kind information-sharing arrangement that will help them collectively deter and respond to crises.  And with Japan and India, the United States is sharing lessons learned on disaster responses and building greater maritime security cooperation. Fourth, in addition to strengthening relationships, we must enhance the capacities of the regional security architecture, particularly on maritime security. American men and women in uniform are working together with countries in the region to build that capacity – especially on maritime security. For example, the U.S.S. Fort Worth, one of the Navy’s nimble littoral combat ships, just returned from a regional tour, where it was welcomed everywhere from South Korea to Southeast Asia.  And Singapore’s willingness to host LCS ships like Fort Worth helps all of us respond more quickly and effectively to regional crises.  For example, when Air Asia Flight 8501 disappeared this past winter, the Fort Worth was able to be on the scene within 24 hours to help with search and recovery. We’re doing even more together.  In Vietnam, where I will travel next, the United States is providing equipment and infrastructure support to the Vietnamese coast guard.  Just this month in Malaysia, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson carrier strike group participated in air combat training with Malaysian air and surface units.  In the Philippines, the United States is helping to build a National Coast Watch System to improve Manila’s maritime domain awareness.  And in Indonesia, America recently began conducting sea surveillance exercises together, which included, for the first time flight portions over the South China Sea. And that’s just a start.  Today, I am pleased to announce that DoD will be launching a new Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative.  And thanks to the leadership of the Senators here today…and others, Congress has taken steps to authorize up to $425 million dollars for these maritime capacity-building efforts. And fifth, to ensure that our institutions, alliances, partnerships, and capability…cap…excuse me, capacity building efforts meet their potential, we must be better connected.  We can accomplish this by working together, communicating better, and developing habits of cooperation. Every year the United States helps plan and host hundreds of exercises and engagements in the region.  From Foal Eagle to Balikatan, from Malabar to Garuda Shield, RIMPAC, Talisman Sabre to Cobra Gold, with every engagement we get smarter and more effective together, while decreasing the risk of misinterpretation and miscalculation. We can also limit that risk by improving communication further.  For example, the United States and China have agreed to two historic confidence-building agreements this past fall, and the United States hopes to do more.  We’re working to complete another measure this year that aims to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  Building better habits of U.S.-China military-to-military cooperation not only benefits both countries but benefits the whole region as well. Beyond exercises and military-to-military cooperation, we also build habits of cooperation when we work together to confront real world challenges, such as responding to natural disasters and other humanitarian crises. These efforts are critically important in a disaster-prone region.  Just a few weeks ago, the United States worked together with partners to respond to Nepal’s tragic earthquake, with U.S. Marines, based in Okinawa, helping alongside India, Japan, China, Thailand, and others.  And we don’t just work together.  We sacrifice together.  Tragically, six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers perished when their helicopter went missing in the mountains during relief operations.  Their loss will not be forgotten.  Together we can honor their memory by continuing the work they began. America has been here, after typhoons, earthquakes, and plane crashes… and America will keep being here…committed to the long-standing practice of playing a part, a pivotal part, in assuring safety and stability in a region, the region. We face today another humanitarian crisis.  As we speak, an urgent refugee situation is unfolding in the Bay of Bengal that requires both a comprehensive solution and quick action to save lives.  I want to commend Malaysia’s leadership, as well as Indonesia, Thailand, and others, who are working along with the United States and others, to locate the migrants and prepare search and rescue operations. These humanitarian efforts, and the habits of cooperation they help form, demonstrate what we can do when we work together.  Working together, as we have in Nepal, in the fight against piracy, and in preventing illegal trafficking and fishing in the Gulf of Thailand – just to name a few examples – allows us do more and better around the region.  And that’s how we reach the future a stronger security architecture affords…a future where everyone continues to rise and everyone continues to win. To realize that future, we must tackle urgent issues like the security and stability of the South China Sea. Yesterday, I took an aerial transit of the Strait of Malacca.  And when viewed from the air, it is even clearer how critical this region’s waterways are to international trade and energy resources.  We’ve all benefitted from free and open access to the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.  We all have a fundamental stake in the security of the South China Sea.  And that’s why we all have deep concerns about any party that attempts to undermine the states [sic] quo and generate instability there, whether by force, coercion, or simply by creating irreversible facts on the ground, in the air, or in the water. Now, it’s true that almost all the nations that claim parts of the South China Sea have developed outposts over the years…of differing scope and degree.  In the Spratly Islands, Vietnam has 48 out…posts; the Philippines, eight; Malaysia, five; and Taiwan, one. Yet, one country has gone much further and much faster than any other.  And that’s China. China has reclaimed over 2,000 acres, more than all other claimants combined…and more than in the entire history of the region.  And China did so in only the last 18 months.  It is unclear how much farther China will go.  That is why this stretch of water has become the source of tension in the region and front-page news around the world. The United States is deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities…to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  As a Pacific nation, a trading nation, and a member of the international community, the United States has every right to be involved and concerned.  But these are not just American concerns.  Nations across the region and the world, many of you here in the room today, have also voiced the same concerns and raised questions about China’s intentions in constructing these massive outposts. So let me make clear the position of the United States: First, we want a peaceful resolution of all disputes.  To that end, there should be an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants.  We also oppose any further militarization of disputed features.  We all know there is no military solution to the South China Sea disputes.   Right now, at this critical juncture, is the time for renewed diplomacy, focused on a finding a lasting solution that protects the rights and the interests of all.  As it is central to the regional security architecture, ASEAN must be a part of this effort: the United States encourages ASEAN and China to conclude a Code of Conduct this year.  And America will support the right of claimants to pursue international legal arbitration and other peaceful means to resolve these disputes, just as we will oppose coercive tactics. Second, the United States will continue to protect freedom of navigation and overflight – principles that have ensured security and prosperity in this region for decades.  There should be no mistake: the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as U.S. forces do all over the world.  America, alongside its allies and partners in the regional architecture, will not be deterred from exercising these rights – the rights of all nations.  After all, turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit. Finally, with its actions in the South China Sea, China is out of step with both the international rules and norms that underscore the Asia-Pacific’s security architecture, and the regional consensus that favors diplomacy and opposes coercion.  These actions are spurring nations to respond together in new ways: in settings as varied as the East Asia Summit to the G-7, countries are speaking up for the importance of stability in the South China Sea.  Indonesia and the Philippines are putting aside maritime disputes and resolving their claims peacefully.  And in venues like ADMM-Plus and East Asia Maritime Forum [sic: Expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum], nations are seeking new protocols and procedures to build maritime cooperation. The United States will always stand with its allies and partners.  It’s important for the region to understand that America is gonna remain engaged…continue to stand up for international law and universal principles…and help provide security and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come. The South China Sea is just one issue we will face as the Asia-Pacific continues to rise and prosper.  There will surely be others.  We cannot predict what challenges the future holds, but we do know how we can work to ensure the peace and prosperity…the region, and the opportunity to rise for all nations and all people…for that to happen, we must do so together.  What the region needs instead, is an architecture where everyone rises and everybody wins. That’s what is happening across the region right now.  We come together on a daily basis to settle disputes, respond to crises, and prevent conflict.  For example, in the Bay of Bengal, India and Bangladesh have proven that diplomacy can work in resolving maritime differences.  In Southeast Asia, nations like Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia are developing new training facilities that will build regional capacity in peacekeeping, disaster relief, and counter-terrorism.  And in the Indian Ocean, many nations, including China, are rooting out the scourge of piracy. But we all know we have more work to do.   And by taking steps now to ensure the regional architecture that has reinforced norms, stronger institutions and alliances, more capabilities, and deeper connectivity, we can ensure our successors at the Shangri-La Dialogue in twenty years will be talking about the challenges and opportunities presented by the rise of yet other Asia-Pacific nations.  But I hope they’ll also be discussing, perhaps, the latest U.S.-China-India multilateral maritime exercise…a Japan-ROK joint disaster response in the South China Sea…and ASEAN-wide security network…new understanding for cyberspace that ensures security and the free flow of information. If those are the conversations at Shangri-La 2035, we will have succeeded.  We will still face challenges and crises…but we will face them together, with a regional security architecture where everyone rises and everybody wins.  And that will be a worthy legacy. Thank you.

"April 27, 2016","Thank you Chairman Cochran, distinguished members.  I appreciate your having me here, Chairman Dunford, and Undersecretary McCord today, and above all for steadfastly supporting DoD’s men and women – military and civilian alike – who serve and defend our country all over the world.  Over the last two weeks, I’ve visited many of those troops in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.  And I couldn’t be prouder of what they’re doing to advance our security and stand by our friends and allies in those critical regions. I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s 2017 defense budget, which marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense.  In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much-needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to help pass it.  That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future. Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world, as we’ve been since the end of World War II.  That’s thanks in large part to the unequivocal strength of the United States military.  And as we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget. I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL – which we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing.  And all the while, we’re continuing to help protect our homeland. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we’re doing to pressure and destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria – beginning with Iraq, which Chairman Dunford and I both visited over the course of last week.  There, with our support, the Iraqi Security Forces retook Ramadi, have been reclaiming further ground in Anbar Province – most recently the city of Hit – and along with Iraqi Kurdish forces have begun operations to isolate and pressure Mosul, with the intent of collapsing ISIL’s control over that city. As we’ve made this progress, and with momentum in this campaign clearly on our side, last week in Baghdad I announced a number of key actions we’re taking to continue accelerating our campaign against ISIL.  We’ll be placing advisors with the ISF – that is, the Iraqi Security Forces – down to the brigade and battalion level, to help enhance decision-making and responsiveness.  We’ll be leveraging Apache attack helicopters to support the ISF’s ongoing efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul.  We’ll send additional HIMARS to support the Iraqi ground offensive there.  We’ll provide financial assistance to the Peshmerga, up to $415 million, to bolster one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIL.  And, to do all this, we’re going to adjust how we use our forces and also bring in about 215 more of them.  As in the past, President Obama has approved all these actions at my and the Chairman’s recommendation. We’re also doing more in Syria.  As the President announced earlier this week, we’re increasing U.S. forces there six-fold, from 50 to 300.  This comes after capable and motivated local forces supported by our coalition retook the east Syrian town of Shaddadi, severing the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq.  These additional 250 personnel, including special operations forces, will help expand our ongoing efforts to identify, train, and equip capable, motivated local forces inside Syria to help isolate and pressure Raqqa.  They’ll also serve as a hub to incorporate partner SOF – from both longstanding traditional allies and Gulf countries – to augment our coalition’s counter-ISIL efforts there.   I should note, however, that Syria is an area where we need your help, particularly in releasing $349 million in Section 1209 funds to help train and equip our partners on the ground, as a centerpiece of our strategy there. All this comes on top of what we’ve already done to accelerate the military campaign – such as intensifying our air campaign based on new intelligence; introducing an expeditionary targeting force; and expanding the fight against ISIL to every domain, including cyber and space.  And as we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding for 2017 – requesting 50 percent more than last year.  But I have to say, much still hinges on the non-military aspects of countering ISIL, particularly efforts to address political and economic challenges in both Iraq and Syria.  That’s critical to ensuring ISIL stays defeated. Next, two of the other four strategic challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great power competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance to the region to maintain the stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, enabling so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future.  And, as I saw in India and the Philippines at the beginning of my trip, our engagement in the Asia-Pacific is deeply appreciated and in high demand – by enduring allies and new friends alike. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our regional friends and allies – especially Israel, to which we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment, and also our Gulf partners, whom I met with last week in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. Now, addressing all of these five challenges requires new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, we know we must deal with these challenges across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also especially in cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also led to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit. Key to our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to ensure that anyone who starts a conflict with us will regret doing so.  In our budget, our capabilities, our readiness, and our actions, we must and will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We see them in Crimea, Syria, and the South China Sea.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting. In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us better address these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces, and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts.  In our Navy, we’re emphasizing not just increasing the number of ships, which we’re doing, but especially their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships, and extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will keep ensuring our dominance in all domains. As we do this, our budget also seizes opportunities for the future.  That’s a responsibility I have to all my successors – to ensure the military and the Defense Department they inherit is just as strong, if not stronger, than the one I have the privilege of leading today. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, innovating operationally, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – as we always have, to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent.  Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to meeting it. And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise, and we need your help with all of them – from continuously improving acquisition, to further reducing overhead and excess infrastructure, to modernizing and simplifying TRICARE, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization. Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  The Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both.  That’s what this budget is designed to do, and we need your help to succeed. I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, making changes that are necessary and consequential.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we indicated last year we would be asking for and what the budget deal gave us – a net total of about $11 billion less is provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act out of a total of almost $600 billion – but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs. In this context, I have serious concerns with a proposal from one of the defense committees to underfund DoD’s overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion, and spend that money on programmatic items we did not request.  While I don’t expect this committee to consider such a proposal, I have to say that this approach is deeply troubling, and flawed for several reasons. It’s gambling with warfighting money at a time of war – proposing to cut off our troops’ funding in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria in the middle of the year.  It would spend money on things that are not DoD’s highest unfunded priorities across the joint force.  It buys force structure without the money to sustain it and keep it ready, effectively creating hollow force structure, and working against our efforts to restore readiness.  It doesn’t address the much bigger strategic risk DoD faces of $100 billion in looming automatic cuts; in fact, it’s a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability that DoD needs now and desires for the future.  And it’s another road to nowhere, with uncertain chances of ever becoming law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution – exactly the kind of terrible distraction we’ve seen for years, that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.  I cannot support such maneuvers as Secretary of Defense. The fact is, DoD’s greatest strategic risk is losing the stability we got from the budget deal this year, and having uncertainty and sequester return in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest budget priority for us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration – to prevent that $100 billion in automatic cuts – so we can maintain stability and sustain all these critical investments over time. We’ve seen this done before, and that same support, coming together, is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.

	Chairman Dempsey, Secretary Perry, Justice Kagan, thank you for your kind words. And distinguished guests, so many distinguished guests, members of the administration, family, and friends, thank you. Thank you all for being here today.

	The past two and a half weeks have been an opportunity to reconnect with the many fine public servants at the Pentagon and here in Washington, and there are few finer than Chairman Dempsey. I sleep better at night with him on the job– I'm sure we all do.  Marty, our men and women in uniform are fortunate for your leadership, and our country is stronger and safer for it. Thank you.

	Justice Kagan, after two days of congressional testimony, it's nice to spend some quality time with a different branch of government. You have made remarkable contributions in academia, policy, and on the bench. And I also know, as Dean of Harvard Law you were a fierce advocate for the school's veterans’ community.  Thank you for that leadership, and for doing me the honor of being here today.

	There are three mentors whom I want to recognize today –  two of whom are here and one who sadly isn't.

	Bill Perry, you helped the United States write a more peaceful and prosperous post-Cold War history. And in the process, you established the model of a modern Secretary of Defense. Bill, you stood up for me early in my career. You stood in for my father at my wedding. And here you are today.  Our nation and the world are safer because of your leadership and intellect, and also because of your civility. Thank you always for standing by me, and thank you for your example.

	We do not have enough time to talk about all the history in which Brent Scowcroft figures. With a cool head, Brent helped steer the ship of state for over five decades, and through some tumultuous waters, and with a warm heart, he helped countless men and women, including me, strengthen their faith in public life.  Brent reminds us all to look at today's dangers with a longer perspective, to see opportunities when so many see crises, to remember our strengths when so many focus on our challenges.  Brent, thank you.

	And Jim Schlesinger, who I'm sorry did not live to see this day, was a mentor and model for bringing a fierce, analytic intellect to the thorniest policy problems.  Jim always surrounded himself with the best people, wherever they came from. He relished strenuous but always constructive debate, and he followed the evidence wherever it took him.  I was a beneficiary of his openness to new people and new thinking, and from him I learned to do the same.

	My fantastic family is here as well.  My daughter Ava and my son Will are – and don't make any mistake about this guys –the pride of my life.  And my perfect wife, Stephanie, is my partner in life and in service to this great institution, and especially to our military families, whom we love so much.

	Ladies and gentlemen, to serve as America's 25th Secretary of Defense is the highest honor. And I am grateful to President Obama for his trust and confidence, and to the U.S. Senate for my confirmation, and to all of you for your friendship and support, without which I know I wouldn't be here.

	Being back, I'm reminded how easy it is in Washington –and in this building –to focus solely on our challenges.  And it is indeed a turbulent, rough world out there.  But as a nation and as a department, this is also a moment to continue to shine the beacon of American leadership and to seize the many bright opportunities in front of us. The men and women of this department will not only continue to protect our country, but also ensure we leave a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising world to our children, to live their lives, raise their families, dream their dreams.  We are standing for our shared values in Europe against those who would turn back the clock.  We're standing with our friends and allies against savagery in the Middle East.  In the Asia-Pacific, where new powers rise and old tensions still simmer, and where half of humanity resides, we are standing up for a continuation of the decades-long miracle of development and progress underwritten by the United States.  And in cyberspace, we are standing with those who create and innovate against those who seek to steal, destroy, and exploit.

	And as technology and globalization revolutionize how the world works, and also as the Pentagon's budget tightens, we have the opportunity to open ourselves up to new ways of operating, recruiting, buying, innovating, and much more.  America is home to the world's most dynamic businesses and universities.  We have to think outside this five-sided box and be open to their best practices, ideas, and technologies.

	And as the 9/11 generation begins to leave our ranks, we also have the opportunity to attract gifted and idealistic future service members and civil servants, even as we honor the sacrifices of those who came before them.  I have learned from my kids and from my students that every generation is different.  This new one has no memory of the Cold War and dim memories even of 9/11.  But they still are devoted to living lives of service and purpose.  We must attract the finest among them.

	In realizing all these opportunities, previous generations and my recent predecessors – some of the most honorable public servants I have ever worked for: Bob Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel… and I see Bill Cohen here as well: Mr. Secretary… All of them have blessed us with a remarkable inheritance, a more secure country, a stronger institution, and the world's greatest military.  And we owe the same to those who come after us.

	I will remember that on each of the 686 days between now and the end of President Obama's term in office.  Just as I wake up every day committed to putting in a day of service worthy of our extraordinary men and women in uniform. We have some of our amazing soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen here today. You represent the finest fighting force the world has ever known and a deep line of warriors who have fought in Lexington and Concord, in Gettysburg and Midway, in Fallujah and Helmand.  In the years ahead, your country will call on you to continue that tradition, perhaps sending you into harm's way. My greatest obligation will be to help the Commander-in-Chief make those decisions with wisdom and care, to get you what you need to fight and win, and to ensure the welfare and dignity of you and your families. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you for the trust that you place in me. I will do my best to live up to it, and may God bless you, all of you, and the United States of America.

	Thank you. ",Ceremonial Swearing-In,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606651/ceremonial-swearing-in/
"Sept. 11, 2016","Today, we return to the site of an attack motivated by barbarism and hate.  An attack that rattled the world, that shook this mighty building, and that took 184 lives from us here at the Pentagon as well as thousands more in New York and Pennsylvania. Mr. President, Chairman Dunford, honored guests, family and friends of those we lost on 9/11: Today, we come together, as we have every year since 2001.  We come together to remember those we lost that day and to stand again with their friends and families, to honor those we’ll never forget.  We come together to reflect on all we’ve done together to recover and rebuild, to respond and to retaliate.  And we come together to recommit to our hard but certain mission – to protect our country and our people, and to make a better world for our children. To all those here before us who lost loved ones 15 years ago, our hearts and deepest sorrows are with you.  We know that we can never fully know what you feel on this solemn day, as you return to this place.  But we do know – we fully know – what your loved one’s sacrifice means to our Department and to our country, and what your resolve means to all of us as we come to work each day to continue the mission your fallen loved ones summon us to.  As we do, your example makes us stronger, and for that, we’re grateful. We need that strength and we have that resolve, as we continue to confront and defeat those who conspired to attack us then – and all who aspire to do so today. Indeed, when someone strikes at the heart of what we stand for, we respond with the full might of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Because our memory is long and our reach and resolve are endless, our enemies cannot hide, they cannot escape, they cannot endure.  Wherever they are, they will surely, no matter how long it takes, come to feel the righteous fist of American might. Since September 11th, 2001, millions of America’s best young men and women have volunteered to respond to those attacks and to defend what’s best about America and civilization itself – our freedoms, our values, our care for life, our way of life. It’s because of those Americans – their service and their sacrifice – that the United States has hammered those who attacked us with every manner and measure of American power – choking terrorist networks, thwarting looming attacks, and bringing Osama bin Laden to eternal justice. It’s because of those Americans that 15 years later, as the threat of terrorism evolves, our fight continues.  Whether they still call themselves al-Qaeda or cloak themselves beneath the black flag of ISIL, nothing changes who terrorists are or what we’ll do to protect our country.  For we possess limitless resolve to win, and the wind of goodness at our backs. And it’s because of those Americans, that even as we confront the forces of darkness, the United States has continued to light the way toward a better future.  Whether in world wars or the long battle against terrorists, our men and women in uniform, steadfast ever, have provided the security and upheld the values that have allowed millions upon millions of people – not just in the United States but around the world – to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full. As a result – decades from now, when visitors to this memorial pause to remember the lives lost here on September 11th, 2001, they too will honor the men and women of the 9/11 Generation…and give thanks for all they accomplished. They will forever be the true reflection of who we are as a nation and a military.  A powerful memorial to those we lost 15 years ago.  And a charge to us – at a time of great change and challenge in the world – that we must continue to meet. Few have been more dedicated to doing so than our Commander-in-Chief.  President Obama has taken – each year now of his presidency – the time to remember 9/11.  Whether here, in New York, or elsewhere, he’s never missed a year.  Not one.  He’s also never forgotten that day, or those we lost.  I can tell you that no one pays more care each and every time he sends men and women forth from this building into harm’s way.  And I can tell you he never relaxes in pursuit of those who threaten America.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for taking your time and investing your time in this effort, that I know we all believe is critically important.  And I also want to add my welcome to each of you.  And also to thank your nations’ commitments to this effort because it does connect to our global security, a more peaceful world for all people, a better world, a world that gives us all more hope, more possibilities, more opportunities. As Secretary of Defense, I especially want to recognize the senior defense and security officials here…because you have critical roles to play in supporting global health security.  Last week’s United Nations Security Council session on Ebola reinforced that message. The leaders here today represent over 4 billion people, or more than 60% of the world’s population.  You all represent what we can accomplish together… if we marshal our leadership, our resources, and our commitment to global health security. As Ambassador Rice and Secretary Burwell have noted already this morning, scientific, economic, and demographic trends are magnifying the risks of outbreaks of infectious disease, whether they begin with an accident, terrorism, or nature.  Such events threaten not only the health of our citizens, but also geopolitical stability.  When states are unable to provide basic services for their citizens, dangerous regional and global security consequences result. The risks posed by outbreaks of infectious disease are not new, we know that, but in our interconnected world, they are intensifying.  To prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, we must work across all the sectors of all our governments, and our all of our across nations, in a concerted global effort. While the U.S. Department of Defense has the responsibility of protecting the health and readiness of its armed forces, we are also prepared to help respond to outbreaks of infectious disease that may threaten the stability of nations…and regions. Today, DoD is supporting USAID and other U.S. government agencies as part of an ongoing global effort to stop the spread of Ebola in West Africa. As President Obama announced last week, through Operation United Assistance, the Department of Defense is deploying U.S. troops, as well as our unique capabilities including command and control, logistics, engineering, and training support.  Our Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is providing unique resources and expertise to enhance detection and surveillance. These assets will help enable civilian responders to contain Ebola’s spread, and mitigate its economic, social, and political fallout.  They will support the efforts of partner nations, and multilateral and non-governmental organizations.  And they will help leave behind stronger health care systems and infrastructures. To achieve these objectives – as Ambassador Rice noted earlier– DoD is establishing a command center in Liberia that will support civilian efforts.  We are creating an “air bridge” and an intermediate staging base in Senegal to help transport personnel and supplies into West Africa.  We are standing up a field hospital and treatment units, and will be training thousands of health workers.   Two mobile laboratories, staffed by Ebola experts, are now arriving in Liberia. As President Obama said at yesterday’s UN special session on Ebola, our command center is up and running now, and our teams are working as fast as they can to move in personnel, equipment, and supplies. Because DoD maintains a longstanding research program to defend our troops against infectious diseases, including Ebola, we have been able to provide critical diagnostic tools.  We are also accelerating the manufacturing of potential treatments, and starting clinical trials for a vaccine candidate.  On Wednesday, we received approval to begin safety testing for one vaccine candidate, which will be conducted here at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. As we continue to develop new opportunities to help build a stronger global health care infrastructure, we must also ensure that collaboration across and within our governments is more agile and responsive the next time we face a crisis. Whether we sit in defense ministries or health ministries, we all have a common interest in helping all nations – helping each other - prevent and contain outbreaks – to support the development of health systems and infrastructures that Secretary Burwell described a few minutes ago. That is why DoD will continue its ongoing work to support today’s agenda – we strongly support today’s agenda and are part of that effort – building health security and capacity around the world. Working with the State Department, USAID, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Cooperative Threat Reduction program is supporting capacity-building initiatives with 30 countries.  For example, in the nation of Georgia, which I visited earlier this month, DoD worked with other U.S. agencies to help establish the new Lugar Center.  The Lugar Center a state-of-the-art laboratory that will serve as a node for cooperation with regional and global health authorities.  Other DoD programs help ensure that laboratories around the world with dangerous pathogens are safe and secure. Last year, DoD also developed a unique partnership with the U.S. CDC to strengthen health security capacity in Vietnam, as has been noted this morning, and in Uganda.   This year, we expanded this initiative to 10 more countries. As you all know, our health security agenda is ambitious. But I’m hopeful because today the international community has unprecedented capacity to prevent and halt the spread of infectious disease. I’m hopeful because of the strong leadership gathered here today…because of past triumphs achieved by coalitions like this one in eradicating deadly disease…and because of the dedication of the extraordinary men and women all around the world – from all nations - who have volunteered to help treat, heal, and care for the victims of the crisis in West Africa today. I look forward – my colleagues at DOD look forward - to working with all of you, and your countries, and your organizations, as we continue strengthening the health care systems and security of all nations around the world, and all of our citizens. Thank you all very much for what you do and for your countries’ commitments.

"Sept. 26, 2014","Tony [Orlando], thank you, very much.  You can dance, sing, whatever the hell you want to do here.  This is like a show, really, it’s Vegas in the eastern part of the United States. Tony, I know what you’ve meant to our men and women in uniform over the years and we are grateful for that.  You have been there over many, many years, when it wasn’t always a popular thing, so we are grateful for that. To Lieutenant Colonel Smith and all of you who do so much for our troops and their families, thank you.  Whether you’re in the civilian world, part of the employers that we represent with our recognition here this morning, I thank you on behalf of our country.  I saw the President here this week, and he asked me to also convey his gratitude, his best wishes, and his thanks for what you do for our country. This is, as Tony noted, an important day of recognition.  I understand that, you understand that, but many companies, individuals, and leaders do a little more than just doing their part.   And that’s what this recognition is all about, to note those who go beyond just doing enough—they do more, and we appreciate it. The willingness of American citizens to leave their homes, and their jobs, and their families when called upon to help defend our country has always been a very defining tradition of this country. But they would not be able to do it, as we all know, without the support, and the help, and the encouragement of their employers and their communities back home. Today we have the opportunity to thank those who help make this selfless service – for our men and women who serve our country – make it possible.  Over the past year, the Defense Department received almost 3,000 employer nominations from Guardsmen and Reservists from around the country.  The fifteen we honor today represent the very best in employer support to our Guardsmen and Reservists. Some of today’s honorees are large companies like AT&T;, which has given its deployed Guardsmen and Reservists cell phones and iPads so that they can keep in touch with their families.  AT&T; also recently announced that they are doubling their goal to hire 10,000 veterans and their family members, which benefits Guardsmen and Reservists because many of them are veterans leaving active duty.  Other large companies like Capital One and PNC Bank actively encourage their civilian employees to support activated Guardsmen and Reservists, and their families. Today we are also honoring small businesses.  For them, having an employee leave for multiple weeks a year to serve their country can be a significant burden.  Yet these organizations celebrate their Guardsmen and Reservists for their sacrifices and what they do for their country, and make sure they know how much they are valued.  For J.G. Management Systems, a firm with only 85 employees, that meant stepping up to pay for an employee’s wife and three children to meet him in Italy during his mid-deployment leave.  For the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, it meant making sure a Guardsman’s spouse had the health insurance she needed, and sending Easter baskets to his children. These fifteen employers are diverse in size, in focus, and in responsibilities, but what they share in common with all of us is a commitment to doing everything possible to ensure that their people succeed – in both the military and in their civilian careers…because no one in the Guard or Reserve should ever have to choose between them. More employers should follow the example of Zions National Bank, whose President and CEO personally contacts every employee who gets called up for active duty – he does that to make sure they know of the bank’s continued absolute commitment to them and their families.  Zions also has a Military Relations Manager who tracks deployed employees and initiates an employment reintegration process three months before the employee return. What all of today’s honorees recognize is that our Guardsmen and Reservists – like all military personnel – have unique qualifications and proven leadership experience… the same qualities that drive American companies to hire more veterans each year.   Not only because they value service, but also because it’s good business. As we salute these fifteen companies and organizations, we also recognize all of the Guardsmen and the Reservists and their families that they support.  Our Guardsmen and Reservists are skilled professionals who make an extraordinary contribution to the mission – from Afghanistan’s Korengal Valley, to institutions here at home.  We encourage more employers to recognize this reality, and follow the leadership of today’s employer honorees. On behalf of the Department of Defense, congratulations to all of you, and thank you.  We appreciate everything you do for our National Guardsmen, our Reservists, and their families – and I know they appreciate what you do.  You make our country stronger, you make our country better. Thank you all very much. Thank you.

"May 13, 2015","Good afternoon.  Thanks for coming. I know we’ve all been watching the aftermath of last night’s tragedy in Philadelphia.  And I want to note how deeply saddened we all are to hear that a midshipman from the U.S. Naval Academy was among those who perished in that accident.  This is a painful day for that midshipman’s family, for the entire Academy community, and for all those affected by this tragedy.  And our thoughts and prayers are with them. I’m here today to announce the nomination of General Mark Milley as the next Chief of Staff of the Army, and Admiral John Richardson as the next Chief of Naval Operations.  President Obama accepted these recommendations from me, Secretary McHugh, and Secretary Mabus for the successors of our current chiefs – General Ray Odierno and Admiral Jon Greenert. Both Ray and Jon have been tremendous leaders for their respective services over these last four years – four years that have been critical for our military, and for the country – marked by an ever-changing security environment and persistent budget turbulence, but also by magnificent performance by these two services under their leadership.  We’ll have plenty of time in the months ahead for the proper tributes and farewells, but for now, let me just say that President Obama, Chairmen Dempsey, and I could not have been better served.  And the same is true for the American soldiers and sailors and their families serving across the country and across the world.  For that, we’re grateful. General Mark Milley – a warrior and a statesman.  He not only has plenty of operational and joint experience – in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and on the Joint Staff – but he also has the intellect and vision to lead change throughout the Army.  When he was in Afghanistan as commanding general of ISAF Joint Command, I had a lot of opportunities to observe Mark on the ground – leading our coalition of allies and partners, and helping the Afghan people prepare to take responsibility for their own security.  Mark and I flew to Herat the day after an attack on the U.S. Consulate there, and I saw Mark take command of the scene and stand with our people there.  I was impressed by his candor and good judgement, and I knew right away that he had even more to offer to the United States Army. Likewise, Admiral John Richardson was a clear choice.  He’s a bold thinker, a tremendous leader, and the go-to officer for many of the Navy’s tough issues in recent years – from preparing for the Ohio-class replacement ballistic missile submarine, to handling problems of integrity and ethics.  He is in high demand – I had to wrestle him away from the Secretary of Energy – but as anyone who’s worked with John will tell you, he’s worth the fight.  I told Ernie Moniz that if I could clone John Richardson, I would.  I know he’ll do an excellent job of helping steer the United States Navy in the years to come. So to Mark and your wife Hollyanne, John and your wife Dana, congratulations.  And thank you, and thank your families, for your willingness to concert – continue serving our great country. And again, I want to thank General Odierno and Admiral Greenert for their service and accomplishments.  Both General Milley and Admiral Richardson are well-positioned to build on that progress.  And I look forward to working with both of them, and other DoD senior leaders, as we drive change, build the force of the future, and help the President with real solutions for the national security challenges we face. Thank you. ",Army & Navy Personnel Announcement,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606670/army-navy-personnel-announcement/
"Nov. 3, 2016","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being here, and look at those magnificent servicemembers standing so proud. Thank you. Listen, before I begin, I need to share with you, in case you weren't aware that it's been a tough day for us in Afghanistan.  Two of our servicemembers were killed, along with four others wounded, in an operation alongside our Afghan partners in Kunduz Province.  The Afghans also suffered casualties.  We’re still learning all the details, but I hope you’ll join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the family, loved ones, friends and teammates of those affected by this tragedy. All of them are in our thoughts and prayers.  And we’re going to honor their sacrifice by remaining firm in our resolve to complete our mission in Afghanistan. Over 40 years ago, a young high school student in Washington, D.C. got a summer job working at the Navy Department’s Naval Sea Systems Command.  Now, for those who may not be old enough to remember – I am – that was a different time for our military. I remember it all too well. This was the last years of Vietnam, our armed forces were facing many challenges.  It was also the start of a technological revolution that transformed how we live, how we work, and how we fight.  And just to show you, a summer intern in those days in Washington, D.C. worked the punch card machine, because that was how computers worked back then. Now, four decades later, our technology, our military, and that young man have come a long way. You can see that remarkable progress in how our military operates and where we operate from space to cyberspace.  You can see it in how this command, the United States Strategic Command, supports every DoD mission in every region and in every domain.  And you can also see that progress in the leader we honor today, Admiral Cecil Haney – once that key punch operator – and now a combatant commander, and long an inspiration to our men and women in uniform. Chairman Dunford, STRATCOM team, Congressman Ashford, Congressman Fortenberry, Mayor Rita [Sanders], friends, family, it’s an honor to be with you today as we pass this critical command from Admiral Haney to General John Hyten, two of our military’s most accomplished leaders. I’d like to especially welcome Admiral Haney's family – his wife, whom he affectionately calls “Ms. Bonny,” daughter Elizabeth. Although Cecil may be the warrior in the family, we know Bonny is the real fighter.  Bonny, we owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude for your service and your sacrifice over the years. I know you're looking forward to spending more time with your husband and all of us in the DoD family, including me and my wife Stephanie, wish you and your family the very best. And to the men and women of STRATCOM, each and every one of you, all of you are doing one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our magnificent country and to make a better life and a better world for our children. In the heart of our nation, you perform a mission at the center of everything we do as a Department.  You underpin our nuclear deterrence.  You enable precision-guided munitions and navigation, space capabilities, and experiment with new warfighting strategies in emerging domains to prepare us for whatever the future may bring. Through it all, each of you is critical at a time when our military is addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.  We're countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We're managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region of the world for America's future.  We're strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We're checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We're accelerating the lasting defeat of ISIL – lasting and certain defeat, destroying it and its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.  And we're preparing to contend, moreover, with an uncertain future, ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not even anticipate today. And all the while, of course, America's nuclear deterrence remains the bedrock of our security, which all of you ensure here at STRATCOM.  As you do so, you manage uncertainty, prepare for change, and perform your duties with the unparalleled excellence we expect of each and every one of you.  I couldn't be prouder of what you've accomplished. And you've done all this thanks to the wisdom and leadership of Admiral Haney. For Cecil, of course, that summer job became a remarkable career.  Graduating from Annapolis in 1978, he joined the Navy at a time when we were still very much thinking about the Cold War and that kind of threat.  Much has changed since then, but over the years – whether he was commanding a submarine, operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific as commander of the Pacific Fleet, or addressing global, multi-domain threats here in Nebraska – Cecil has confronted many of our most complex challenges with unwavering dedication, profound insight, and the calm, deliberative manner that the gravity of these missions require. Although most of Cecil's accomplishments remain classified of course, I want to highlight some that he's done to strengthen our systems, our partnerships, and our people. As a strategist, Admiral Haney contributed to the essential missions of today, even as he prepared STRATCOM for the missions of tomorrow – by ensuring a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent force, while paving the way to its future, and by collaborating with new and innovative ways with our intelligence community on space issues. As an ambassador in uniform, he built bridges to our allies, to academia, to industry – recognizing as he says that there's “no stronger deterrent message than partnerships and international cooperation.”  That message is powerful, because as all of you know, the United States is an unrivaled source of innovation, in DoD and outside of DoD. And the United States also has an unrivaled network or friends and allies around the world and our potential opponents have none. That's not accidental. And as leader here at STRATCOM, he's been a champion for your mission, and most importantly for his people – all of you.  That was particularly important as DoD undertook and implemented the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Reviews, which recognized that our country had for decades underinvested in its nuclear forces – and not only in its aging technologies, but also in its people.  And we're determined to correct that now, and we're just beginning to do so – more on that in a moment – and that's in part because Cecil worked tirelessly to get you, and your families, the resources you need, the opportunities to advance your career, and the climate to empower your success. Through all this, Admiral Haney leaves STRATCOM, DoD, and our country stronger because he planned for the future, strengthened key partnerships, and helped ensure we invested in our capabilities, our people, uniformed and civilian.  For all that, I'm confident that STRATCOM will be ready no matter what tomorrow brings.  And I'm certain the nation owes a debt of gratitude to Cecil, to Bonny, the rest of the Haney family.  Thank you all. Now, as we honor STRATCOM's commander this morning, I also want to talk to you about your nuclear and space missions, and emphasize how important they are...to our department, our military, and our nation. In September, I visited Minot Air Base in North Dakota – home of some of the ICBMs and bombers under this command – and I made clear that America's nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our security. While this mission isn't in the headlines every day – as I see it, we're in real trouble if it ever is – it remains the highest priority of the Department of Defense.  That means it's one of STRATCOM's most important jobs – one that we count on you every day to perform with unparalleled excellence – excellence you define. That's because you deter large-scale nuclear attacks against the United States and our allies.  You help convince potential adversaries they can't escalate their way out of a failed conventional aggression.  You assure our allies that our extended deterrence guarantees are credible.  And if deterrence fails – though we hope it never does – you provide the President with options to achieve American and ally objectives, all to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons ever being used in the first place. And as you execute these missions, I and DoD's other senior leaders are making sure we sustain our deterrence by recapitalizing all three legs of our nuclear triad, so they don't age into obsolescence.  Indeed, even as we would all of course, wish to live in a world without nuclear weapons, it's also true – something that President Obama has noted many times – that we may not realize that goal in our lifetimes. And so we must continue to maintain a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. As I mentioned earlier, we're beginning to correct for decades of under investment in nuclear deterrence – dating back to the end of the Cold War, when the United States believed it would be safe to allow funding for the nuclear enterprise to drop, and drop it did, dramatically.  Over the last 25 years, we made only modest investments in basic sustainment and operations.  But while we didn't build anything new for 25 years and neither did our allies, others did – including Russia, North Korea, China, Pakistan, India and for a period of time, Iran.  So we can't wait any longer and we also can't operate under the mistaken assumption that our own recapitalization will stimulate others to invest – because the evidence is just the opposite – they have consistently invested in nuclear weapons during a quarter-century pause in U.S. investment. Our recapitalization is about sustaining deterrence in a world very different from the world of the Cold War.  From ballistic missile submarines, to ICBMs, from bombers to air launch cruise missiles we're replacing many aging nuclear weapons delivery systems because if we don't, we'll lose them which would mean losing confidence in our ability to deter – something we can never afford. Our necessary replacements include the long range standoff weapon, replacing nuclear air-launched cruise missiles that enable the penetration of air defenses by our air launched deterrent...exactly, precisely, just the same logic as when they were first deployed, four decades ago.  Our necessary replacements also include our Ohio Replacement Program to build the next generation of ballistic missile submarines.  Our necessary replacements also include the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent Program – in which we'll be replacing old ICBMs with new ones that will be less expensive to maintain.  And they include investments in the nuclear command-and-control, communications, and intelligence capabilities that support our nuclear enterprise. As many of you know, that includes satellites, radar systems, ground stations, command post, control nodes, communications links, and more – which are critical to assuring nuclear command and control and providing us with integrated tactical warning and attack assessment. And we're investing, too, in many more parts of our nuclear enterprise, as well.  We're continuing to make vital investments in the people of our nuclear force – the men and women who operate, enable, maintain and secure America's nuclear deterrent every day.  We continue to support the Department of Energy and its national laboratories that play a critical role as DoD's partners in the nuclear deterrence mission.  And we're making much-needed infrastructure and facilities repairs to ensure the maintenance and security of the DoD bases and installations that are home to the nuclear enterprise are up-to-date. This enterprise relies heavily on our space systems, but nuclear deterrence is far from being the only mission we have that depends on space – and let me turn to that, a second mission of STRATCOM. Not everyone thinks about it, but the truth is, space is woven into every aspect of our military operations today – conventional and nuclear alike.  And that's why we're making sure – and making it known – that our space capabilities are as resilient and assured as our nuclear capabilities. While in the past we may have been able to view space as a virtual sanctuary, DoD must now prepare for competition there and seek to prevent conflict from extending into space.  Thanks in part to Admiral Haney's leadership, and the hard work of STRATCOM personnel, we're doing just that – working closely with our partners in the intelligence community and with our allies. Indeed, as space becomes increasingly congested and contested and competitive, it makes STRATCOM's work to deter and defend against attacks in space all the more important.  That's why we're continuing to make serious investments in capabilities that enhance our ability to identify, attribute, and negate threatening actions by others in space.  Our new investments aim to foil these efforts – whether an adversary aims to blind our reconnaissance satellites with lasers, disrupt our satellite communications with jammers, or use kinetic means like a co-orbital attack or a direct ascent missile to destroy the space capabilities that support our forces. Now, some have suggested we should treat space as something separate – either organizationally or managerially or operationally – but doing so would be a mistake.  Because every one of our missions in every domain – air, land, sea, and cyber – and also our potential opponents, rely on space in some way.  Because of that, we must integrate, and not separate, everything we have and do in space. All of you, the men and women of STRATCOM, are ensuring that we leverage and integrate the advantages we enjoy in space for the great benefit of all our combatant commanders and forces on the ground and in the air and in the sea.  STRATCOM is helping us write a playbook for future space operators to follow by incorporating space into our operations and our contingency planning.  Indeed, as we've been updating each of our core contingency plans at DoD, we've made sure they account for how we must now view space as a potential warfighting domain. To make sure we're doing so effectively, we need to experiment.  And that's where STRATCOM's Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center, JICSpOC, comes in. I created the JICSpOC last year to experiment with new concepts of integrated space operations, and so far it's been very effective – helping us identify ways to improve data-sharing, hone our ability to protect and defend critical space infrastructure, and assure command and control if they come under attack. And for several years now, General John Hyten has played a key role in how we've begun to treat space as a warfighting domain – he’s been a key partner of mine – from when we first saw the need for what would become JICSpOC, all the way through how we've operationalized that vision.  And that's one of the many reasons why I'm pleased that he's bringing his 35 years of experience to STRATCOM as its next commander. Of course, he's also bringing along his wonderful family, namely wife Laura – Hi, Laura – she’s here this morning, along with her children Katie and Chris.  And John's brother Scott, and proud parents Sherwyn and Barbara are with us, too. Thank you all for being here.  This is John and Laura's 15th move since John joined the Air Force. So, as he assumes this critical command for our country, I want to thank his family for their flexibility, for their service, and their support. Thanks, Laura and family. Today, John's returning to Offutt after leading our Air Force Space Command in Colorado.  There, he organized, trained, and equipped over 30,000 men and women to support STRATCOM's missions.  But just as important, he's helped shape thinking at our government's highest levels about the threats we face in space. And I've certainly benefited from his strategic counsel. I've known John for years.  We worked together closely when he was Air Force's Director of Space Acquisition at the Pentagon, and I was Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  I can't publicly describe everything we worked on together, but I can say with great confidence that throughout his career – whether serving in space operations, acquisition roles, and all the other things he's done – John has developed a keen understanding of the current and future operational needs of our DoD space force and how to acquire the capabilities we need.  His experience and expertise will be a tremendous asset to STRATCOM as we prepare and face future threats in all domains. And John also has a keen appreciation for what's at stake across the entire strategic landscape for which I will depend on him, as will the President.  When he's in D.C., he's been known to road trip up to Gettysburg to study that 150-year-old-battle.  And recognizing the lush hills of Gettysburg couldn't be more different from the endless vacuum of space, a kinetic conflict in space could exact an even higher toll than that bloody battle, and leave behind a legacy that would last far longer. John's determined not to let that happen.  And whether it's by building interagency partnerships through JICSpOC, training our men and women to face new challenges, John's helped build a more resilient national security space enterprise that will also help strengthen our nuclear deterrence.  That's important work he'll continue here at STRATCOM, because there's more to be done to confront those 21st century threats – we have to continuously adapt, innovate, stay flexible.  With his demonstrated leadership, expertise, managerial acumen, and strategic vision, John will be a strong leader of this command for years to come – ensuring it meets not only the challenges we face today, but also those we'll confront in the future. I'll close by emphasizing again that we really have come a long way – both as a military and country – from that summer over 40 years ago when Cecil worked that punch card machine. Today, ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. There's no other military that's stronger, more capable, more experienced, or more innovative in every domain. That's why our military edge is second-to-none.  And it's a fact every American ought to be proud of. That edge, and all that progress, is the result of each of our leaders, each of our officers, each of our enlisted service members, and each of you – every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and DoD civilian – being dedicated to leaving their unit, their command, their office, and their mission a whole lot better, stronger, and more advanced than when they got there. It's an iterative process, one we all contribute to...one I'm very proud of. That's exactly what Admiral Haney did here at STRATCOM, left his mission a whole lot stronger.  Cecil, we're grateful for your tremendous contributions to our safety, to our strategy, and our deterrence.  And most of all, we're grateful for everything you and Bonny have done over the years for our people – here in Nebraska, and everywhere you've served.  As you transition from this command, you can take comfort knowing that STRATCOM is now in the hands of another proven strategic leader, who will keep pushing forward. In the days to come, STRATCOM's mission will continue to remain vitally important to the bedrock of our security, and General Hyten will lead this critical team with the full trust and confidence of me, Chairman Dunford, and President Obama.  And the force he inherits is ready to execute any mission required, thanks to Admiral Haney's visionary leadership. So to Admiral Haney and Bonny, to General Hyten and Laura, to their families, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership: thank you for everything you've done to meet the challenges of today, to stay ahead of the threats of tomorrow, and to keep our nation safe.  May God bless you and my God bless our magnificent country.  Thank you.

"Jan. 9, 2017","Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for being here. Thank you, Chairman Dunford, for those kind remarks, and to you and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the recognition. My time as Secretary of Defense is growing short, and people are beginning to ask me the question, “What’s the best decision you’ve made as Secretary of Defense?”  And I say without hesitation, it’s Joe Dunford.  Recommending General Dunford to the President to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is my best decision.  From him I have benefitted from the soundest, and most candid, and always trustworthy professional military advice, and he’s made sure I got the same from the Joint Chiefs and the Combatant Commanders.  And Joe doesn’t just offer advice and observations, but solutions – whole and rounded out.  That’s very rare and very valuable.  For all of that, for your friendship, thank you, Joe. I’ve imposed upon Ellyn Dunford also, and besides expressing my gratitude to her I want to recognize all she does to ensure the well-being of troops and their families.  Thank you too, Ellyn. Last week, I spoke of President Obama and his leadership and accomplishments as Commander-in-Chief in this hall.  Now I want to add my deep gratitude for the trust and the confidence he reposed in me in three different positions over eight years. My precious, yes perfect wife Stephanie is here, as are my wonderful children, who have become impressive, accomplished adults in the years I’ve been here. Stephanie has her own big job, and she can’t travel with me often.  But when she does, I’m always struck by the effect she has on our troops and our spouses.  You know, our all-volunteer force is largely a married force, a family force – and it matters to troops on far-flung bases and around the world when our family shows our love for their family.  Angel, I’d not only be a lesser Secretary of Defense without you, I wouldn’t be Secretary of Defense without you.  And I truly wouldn’t be who I am without you. So it was 35 years ago this year that I first walked the halls of the Pentagon. In those decades I worked in administrations of both parties and for eleven Secretaries of Defense – and I suppose that makes me the 12th that I’ve worked for. Back then, at the start of my DoD career, the Cold War was at its peak, and I worked on the issues of the time:  missile defenses, the so-called “Star Wars,” basing modes for a new intercontinental ballistic missile, nuclear command and control, continuity of government, and more. Now, when the Cold War ended, the agenda changed.  I ran the program to remove and dismantle former Soviet nuclear weapons and what we would recognize now as the early days of a greater focus on counter-terrorism. Then in 2009 I became Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, working on improving the performance of our acquisition programs and on rapid support for the warfighter in a time of large campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. And then I became Deputy Secretary of Defense, and then Secretary of Defense. Through it all, I’ve learned how important it is for defense leaders to be mindful of the arc of history and the inheritance they received from those who came before them. Therefore, in addition to setting forth for the President, along with General Dunford, the strategic path we need to traverse to meet each of the five challenges we face today – from North Korea, Iran, Russia, China, and terrorism, especially ISIL – there’s a whole other side to being Secretary of Defense, and that is to make sure your successor, and your successor’s successor, also has the finest fighting force the world has ever known in the future.  I’ve tried to the best of my ability as Secretary, and indeed in each of my roles in the department, to meet that sacred commitment. As we plan for the years ahead, we’ve needed to face the fact that we’ve never foreseen the strategic future perfectly, which the arc of my own career with its major changes in the world around me illustrates.  And in a rapidly changing, uncertain, and fiercely competitive world, remaining the best will require the best of technology, agility, full-spectrum readiness, innovative war plans, and above all recruiting, retaining, and developing the people – uniformed and civilian – who will comprise the Force of the Future. One of the things that makes me proudest about the Department of Defense is its ability to adapt and change.  And I am confident in the logic and good sense of what our leadership is doing best to keep us the best. And last, I want to say something about the troops.  In troop talks I always tell them that they are what Stephanie and I wake up for every morning.  I’m so proud of them, I’m so proud to be their leader.  I tell them they’re doing the noblest thing a young person can do with their life, which is to provide security for our people.  Only with that precious security can our fellow citizens wake up in the morning, get ready for work, hug their kids, dream their dreams, live lives that are full. Earlier this year, I was visiting basic training and I went into the bunking area for some brand-new recruits.  Each stood rigidly in front of his bunk at attention.  Now, it wasn’t obvious that they really knew who I was or even what the Secretary of Defense was – but they looked terrified just the same. And as always, I went up to one of them and said, “Why’d you join us?”  He was 18 years old, little stubble of a moustache, alarmed eyes.  But without hesitation he said, “My parents came here when I was three, and they always told me America gave us much and I should give back.”  And then he started to cry, right there in front of 50 bunkmates.  And I’m sure he got a lot of ribbing for that.  But that’s an example of the kind of kid we get, and also the kind of servicemember we want to keep. And that’s why a little later along in their careers, retention’s the issue.  Most of our NCOs and officers are married, so lunch with them and their spouse is a good way to get a sense of them and what it will take in their lives to make the best ones stay.  Our military is deservedly well-regarded in this country, so these young people have options.  And at this point in their lives, both mission and family are usually important to them.  So to keep these people we do what we can to make [family] life compatible with military life, consistent with our military necessity. Those troops and DoD civilians – almost 3 million of them in every time zone of the globe, represented by those here before you in this hall – are what makes America’s the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Everywhere I go in the world, leaders say they like working with America’s troops.  It’s not just because they’re awesomely capable.  It’s also because of how they conduct themselves, and the values they embody.  That’s why the United States has so many friends and allies, and our antagonists have so few or none at all. Because of them – because of them – America’s future is bright.  May they always be guided by the love of their countrymen, and by civility and decency in our whole country equal to theirs.  May God bless them.  And may God bless this department and this country. Thank you, and farewell.

"June 9, 2015","Thank you.  Thank you all. Dov, thank you.  And you, too, represent to me a spirit above Washington and above partisanship in defense.  And we've been colleagues for a long time, and I really appreciate that. What a fantastic evening.  I've known this Center and its chairman Chuck Boyd, for a long, long time.  And I'm proud to receive an award that was previously given to Bob Gates, Bill Cohen, among others.  The Center’s a unique and vital force in our foreign policy debate.  And now I suppose I can say it is foresighted, or maybe optimistic.  After all, you're giving me a Distinguished Service Award after less than four months on the job.  I appreciate the recognition, the vote of confidence. I see so many familiar faces here tonight, and I'm especially pleased that two old friends are here to present the award.  One is Graham Allison, who is a national treasure.  Through his writing, his sage advice, he's helped generations of public servants, including me, not to mention generations of students who have found their way into governments here and around the world.  The nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and I owe him many thanks for his years of friendship and counsel.  And Zal Khalilzad.  One of the finest diplomats of our time.  Thank you both for being here and all of you this evening. Mike?  Where's Mike?  Mike also.  I've known Mike for a long time as well, and as I'll say shortly, the greatest thing about the U.S. military, the finest fighting force the world has ever known, is its people.  But second comes the technology that it marshals.  And I always have to remind people, we don't make any of that in the Pentagon.  Nothing is made there.  Our system, unlike the Soviet system, is one where we buy from companies that are subject to all the other pressures of companies that have to live in competitive capital markets and so forth, and that is the great strength of our country.  And we can't ever forget that they’re our partners in this enterprise.  And Mike, L-3 represents that to me, and I thank you. And I also want to thank Susan, though she had to depart early, for her very, very kind words.  Susan handles the toughest job in Washington, maybe the world, with remarkable intelligence, tenacity, grace. In helping President Obama make hard choices and ensuring his decisions are carried out with the Defense Department's expected excellence, I spend a lot of time with Susan.  I'm better off for it, just as the country is better off for her years of service. I'm going to be very brief.  It's late in the evening, and I'm actually going to depart a little bit from what I have here, so you're going to forgive me if I adlib a little bit.  I'll be very, very brief. And the first thing I wanted to say is that the United States is – and I’m offering my own opinions now –  is in much better shape than many will admit.  This may be controversial in a body of realists…and maybe a little surprising coming from a Secretary of Defense, but I am incredibly optimistic about America's position in the world today. We do face challenges – the issues that keep the editors of the National Interest plenty busy.  North Korea continues to provoke.  ISIL's barbarism outrages the world.  Russia’s aggressive actions have upset more than two decades of peace and stability in Europe.  In Asia, disputes over rocks and shoals are complicated by evolving power dynamics as several regional powers rise.  And terrorism, foreign fighters, cyber attacks, and other ills threaten lives and the security of many around the world, including the United States. But I'm optimistic, because we confront these challenges with remarkable, unparalleled strengths.  Following the worst recession since the Great Depression, our economy is making great gains.  Progress will continue because of America's dynamic and innovative businesses, world-class universities, and the domestic energy revolution now underway.  And our military, long as I said, the finest fighting force the world has ever known, has unmatched operational edge and unrivaled capabilities.  No other military has the kind of skill and agility backed by experience that ours does. When the President nominated me in the Roosevelt Room in December, I said that I would both try to ensure that we defended the country and our friends and allies, and to help grab hold for our country of the many bright opportunities before us.  An important opportunity for America right now is to ensure, for example, that our children can achieve the American dream by leveraging all of our strengths to seize a strong place of comparative advantage in the burgeoning markets represented by an exploding global middle class.  And this was, in fact, the opportunity that I was working on in a totally different life before the President nominated me. And, as I've been reminded in my travels since returning to government, our strengths are multiplied by an unrivaled network of allies and partners –  from Japan, Korea, Australia, India, and others in the Asia-Pacific, to our NATO alliance in Europe, to our global coalition against ISIL and other close partnerships in the Middle East. We have these strong and deepening relationships for several reasons.  First, nobody's more capable, as I said – we have unparalleled people, technology, training, and experience.  Second, our antagonists and competitors push many states towards us – giving us so many friends and partners, and leaving countries like China and Russia, not to mention North Korea, to stand largely alone.   And third, nations seek our friendship not because of our power alone, but because of the gravitational pull of our country's ideals and values and good will. Our unrivaled advantages and our global network of friends are what make America's global strength unique…both today and throughout its history.  But we have to maintain perspective – looking upon the whole world, being clear-eyed about the strengths and vulnerabilities, and avoiding the complacency that has overtaken so many established powers throughout history.  We must not allow that to happen. Strategy now, as in the past, is about perspective.  Keeping perspective means keeping all the world in synoptic view.  It also means knowing which mix of foreign policy tools is best for a given situation.  It means understanding where our challenges today fall in the context of history…and how we can use history's lessons to pursue today's opportunities.  And it means appreciating that preventing the development of serious dangers is a more efficient and effective way…when that's possible, of protecting ourselves, than confronting them later. Too many tend to forget this last point, but by standing strong today – with diplomacy, economic tools and our military – we can forestall worse problems down the road.  That's an approach that served the United States well enough 70 years ago in the aftermath of World War II, and that's the approach that Bill Perry and I termed ""preventive defense"" years back in a book we wrote when we left government service 20 years ago. Preventive defense, like preventive medicine, meant averting dangerous developments before they require drastic remedies.  But just as preventive medicine does not ensure perfect health, preventive defense is not a guarantee of American security.  What it can do is appreciate the uncertainty inherent in the international system and help us pursue balance – between interests and principles, between excellence and action, and prudence and restraint, and between today's security and the future's threats. President Obama, Susan Rice, and I are working together to ensure the United States tries to strike that balance.  And in so doing, we're pursuing a foreign policy that puts our interests first in a way that also always keeps us mindful of our principles.  Take a few of the items that we're working on – here I'm going to adlib a little bit – if you don't mind. First of all, I came back from the Asia-Pacific a few days ago – Stephanie and I were there for about two weeks – and there we're protecting our country, and our allies and our partners, and supporting a regional security architecture built on a foundation of rules and norms that has helped so many in the region to rise and prosper. Regardless of what was going on at home or in other parts of the world – for decade upon decade, during Democratic and Republican presidencies, in time of surplus and deficit, war and peace – it is the United States that has helped maintain stability and the resulting prosperity in the Asia-Pacific uninterruptedly for seven decades. Our rebalance, so-called, to the region, is simply about making sure we always will.  Last month in Singapore, I encouraged our regional allies and partners to come together and strengthen that security architecture, understanding that it is critical to the region where half of humanity's population resides and half of its economic livelihood takes place. In the Middle East, we're taking a balanced approach there as well in our campaign against ISIL.  We strike from the air, while on the ground we're advising and assisting the Iraqi Security Forces, because we know that only they can secure their country in the long run, because their leadership is the only path to ISIL's lasting defeat.  Throughout this campaign, we're trying to take great care to protect the lives of fellow human beings – in stark contrast to our enemy – and alongside a global coalition of allies and partners who are working by, with, and through the government of Iraq, because we believe that a multi-sectarian Iraq, while in fact difficult to preserve, is better than the alternatives.  And as I said, long-term stability depends upon on governance on the ground. Europe – we're defending our interests and our values in Europe as well – standing with those eager to keep moving forward and against those who would turn back the clock. The Kremlin and Vladimir Putin are challenging NATO, the United States, and the international order.  But this past year has demonstrated once again the solidarity of NATO and its partners in Europe…and only a few years after some questioned the relevance of the transatlantic alliance. NATO has been reenergized, and we're doing a great deal together, including exercises, joint training, and capability enhancement.  That reflects the security situation, but also the principles that have helped so many on the continent move forward ‘til [since] the end of the Cold War…principles Putin has rejected to the frustration of Russia's people and its economy – at least in the long run – principles we and our allies will continue to protect. We seek this balanced approach in cyberspace as well, where Americans in uniform not only protect the battle networks and weapons our military relies on – they also help defend the nation, its critical infrastructure, and guard the freedom and openness of the Internet that has fostered revolutions in our economy and culture.  And in a challenging cybersecurity environment  – as demonstrated by the recent attack on the Office of Personnel Management – the new cyber strategy I released in April will help the Defense Department continue to stand with those who use the Internet to create, develop, and innovate, and against those who seek to steal, destroy, and exploit. In our work in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe, and cyberspace, you can see the value of, to use our phrase from years ago, preventive defense.  But we also can appreciate the need to defend our interests while we promote our values. Security is the foundation of our society and everyone's society…without security – my co-colleague Joe Nye always says, security is like oxygen.  If you have it, you pay no attention to it, and if you don't have it, you think of nothing else.  And our job is to make sure that people get to be thinking of other things, that they're living their lives, raising their children, dreaming their dreams without having to worry about their basic security.  That's the mission that we have in the Department. Every once in a while, I get morose because I feel like sometimes the mission of the wonderful people that it is my privilege to lead isn't adequately appreciated every day by the citizens who benefit from it so much.  And I get frustrated by that.  And I try to console myself with the following thought. I say to myself, ""Ash, you know, think about it this way: that means you're doing a good job.""  Because if they wake up every morning and are able to take for granted the fact that they can conduct their lives in safety and security, that's what we're supposed to be doing.  The paradox of that is sometimes they fail to support us to the extent that they should.  So at least that's how I console myself. Dov mentioned my commitments that I made when I came into this job, and I wanted to say something about them also. The first, and you may have inferred this from what has been said so far, and this is true of me and Stephanie both, is to our people, our wonderful people.  That's what makes us the best in the world. And I don't take them for granted.  We – they need to be cared for, they need to be treasured.  They need to have their dignity and respect upheld.  And above all, when we do anything that puts them in jeopardy, we have to do that with the greatest care and deliberation. My second commitment was to this country – to the President to help him solve the terrible challenges that afflict our world and our country, and to give him my best and most candid advice, and also to ensure that he receives the most candid professional military advice, and to make sure that our great Department carries out those decisions with what is now an accustomed expectation of excellence. And then the third thing, the third commitment I said, was to the future, and that's what touches upon what Dov said.  And if I leave something behind when I'm done with this job, this is what, if I achieve it, I'll be proudest of, and that is to help lead our institution into the future. To embrace the future, we have to be open to change.  And we're a fantastic institution of more than 200 years of age, lives on tradition, lives on honor, lives on grounded human values.  But we need to change in order to stay the best. And the only way to change in today's world is to be open, so I'm constantly trying to open us up –open us up to new ideas, open us up to new thinking, and make sure that we're the most aware institution in our society.  And I'll give you a couple examples of that. One is as it regards people.  I am very intent upon making sure that 20 years from now and 40 years, the quality of the people that we have become accustomed to having in our military service is the same in those decades to come as it is now.  And that's not something you can take for granted.  Labor markets change, generations change.  If you have children, as Stephanie and I do, you know that they think differently about their lives than we did.  They think differently about their careers.  They think about moving around, moving in and out of institutions.  Moving around to move up.  They want a particular kind of challenge.  They want mobility.  They want different things than we wanted.  And we need to continue to offer them as a military institution in order to continue to attract the very best in our society. Likewise, technology.  We need to be open to non-traditional sources of technology.  Now, Mike's industry is a traditional source of technology, but I mean within our traditional defense industry, they're reaching out also as we are trying to do to the broad technology base that now characterizes our role. When I started out in this business, everything of consequence that happened in the world of technology happened in America.  And most of that happened in defense, or at least government precincts.  Those things are no longer true.  It's a fact.  And so if we're going to stay the very best, we need to reach out and be open. So in all these ways and many more, I think that my commitment to the future requires us to be committed to change, and change requires an openness, an openness to ideas.  And so you'll see me trying to stretch us and connect us to things, and that's – it's my effort to make sure that in – that my successor's successor's successor's successor inherits an institution as fine as – as fine as the one it is my privilege to lead now. I owe that to them in the future, and that's my third commitment.  So if you see me doing what I'm doing and you're trying to – wondering what Ash is up to, those are the things that are going on in my mind. Closing, it's a privilege to be with you.  So many old friends, so many people who represent –Brent's here, the great, great traditions of continuity and continuity of vision, a continuity of working out things among different points of view that represents the great strength of our country. That's the foundation that I get to rest upon now.  I don't take it for granted.  I'm very grateful.  And I'll try to do you proud in the times ahead.  I know you bet on me…coming here…by giving me this award.  I'm very pleased.  I'm flattered.  I'm grateful.  I'll try to do you proud.  Thank you.

"Nov. 10, 2016","Good afternoon.  Thank you so much for being here and…joining me in what is a great privilege – and that is to honor one of the finest strategic thinkers and policymakers of our time Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski – or as he is simply known across town and around the world: Zbig. As we do so, it’s a pleasure to be joined by so many friends, current and former colleagues, and dedicated public servants past and present, including John Hamre, Bob Kimmitt, Paula Dobriansky, and many more. I also want to welcome Zbig’s family, his wife Emilie and his sons Mark and Ian – thank you all for being here, and for all your support for Zbig over the years.  The United States and the world owe you all a debt of gratitude. Today, I present Dr. Brzezinski with DoD’s highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, for his contributions to the defense of our great country. Now, it might seem odd to some of you that a Secretary of Defense would give the Department of Defense’s highest civilian award to a former Presidential National Security Advisor.  But it should not seem odd at all. That’s because this award, here and at this moment, reflects an enduring truth about America’s defense, that it is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must shepherd it across the years from strategic era to strategic era, from domain to domain – not just sea and air and land, but also in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – and from presidential administration to presidential administration, across parties, and across our government. In the academy, at the White House, and now at CSIS, Zbig has long understood that the way to do just that is to have a global strategic perspective – one that helps us understand where our challenges today fall in the broad arc of history, and how we can use history’s lessons in today’s strategic environment.  Indeed, Zbig wrote in his 2012 book that “historically, America has shown that it rises to the occasion when challenged.”  But he also pointed out that today’s world and security environment present “far different challenges than those in the past.” He’s right on both points.  And with his strategic vision, advice and guidance, and his example on how to further America’s interests and our ideals, the men and women of the Department of Defense are rising to meet the five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges we face today. Indeed, we’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we protect our people here in the homeland. And, of course, we must continue to be flexible and agile, because, no matter how smart Zbig has been and is, when you look at history, you see that we have an imperfect record when it comes to predicting the future.  So we’re preparing to contend, in addition, with an uncertain future – ensuring that our forces, our technology, our personnel, our training, and our operational concepts are ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. While we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges, we do have the ability to set our course strategically – so that while the world may be a confused place, we are not confused about our interests and how to protect them.  As we do so, we can learn much from Zbig.  With his one-of-a-kind wit and candor, Zbig has counseled Presidents, influenced global leaders, and educated policymakers throughout his career – including me, over the many years we’ve known each other and particularly during my time as SecDef – on how to cultivate the strategic perspective that he embodies and espouses. That means keeping the world in synoptic view, seeing all of its parts and problems at once, and using the great physical and moral strengths of the world’s greatest nation wisely, to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  It means knowing which mix of the full range of foreign policy tools – including but not limited to the finest fighting force the world has ever known – is best for a given situation.  And it means keeping ever grounded in our national security interests…they’re our North Star whether in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, or elsewhere. Zbig has of course seen how dark and dangerous the world can be, particularly during World War II.  And, when in government at another time of global change, competition, and crises, he resolutely helped direct a robust, forward-leaning American foreign policy.  Whether it was confronting Soviet aggression at a time when it was heating up the Cold War, seizing a precious opportunity for peace in the Camp David Accords, or bending the arc of history by normalizing relations with China, Zbig helped keep America safe and put us in the position to continue to do so for decades to come. Of course, Zbig also knows well how America has long brought light to his own life, to his family, and to the world.  For that reason, Zbig understood – like few other national security professionals – that American foreign policy cannot be driven by interests and security alone.  His former special assistant and one of my predecessors as SecDef Bob Gates has written, Zbig has a “long history of blending tough-minded realism with high-minded idealism.”  That’s because he knew personally what the causes of freedom, human rights, and democracy mean to the people of the world, and thus what they can mean to American policy. Blending realism with idealism is not always easy.  Indeed, Zbig was called at 3:00AM one night in 1979 and told the Soviet Union had commenced a nuclear attack on the United States with 200 missiles.  He explained years later that he knew, quote, “everybody would be dead in 28 minutes” so he said, “if that was the case, I was going to make sure we had lots of company.”  And with that Zbig, our one-man deterrent, made sure the Strategic Air Command bombers were taking off.  Thankfully, the reported Soviet attack turned out to be incorrect – Zbig was given the right information shortly thereafter, and he made sure to recall the SAC order. But with stakes that high, Zbig – and other officials – could be forgiven for focusing on cold calculus, on interests alone.  He’s done that, but doing that alone is a temptation he’s fought against in government and out.  He’s written that the United States must not “subordinate everything else in the world to an exaggerated sense of insecurity.” Instead, “we have to learn to live” in an insecure world with “dignity, with idealism, with steadfastness.”  Zbig has done just that in his own life. In an interview 25 years ago, Zbig explained that he considered the “highest human achievement” for him was to “accomplish something positive” for America his adopted country, for Poland his native land, “for the free world, and probably for human kind.”  Even after he left government, Zbig was committed to doing so, to combining thought and action, advice and advocacy, writing and lecturing in the hope of doing good and helping push events and decisions in the “right direction.”  Zbig, I think we can all agree you have done just that, and more. Because you’ve done so, you’ve helped ensure America has – time and again – risen to the occasion, and that as a consequence millions and millions can get up in the morning, go to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, and give their children a better future. Zbig, today we acknowledge you for your service, your strategic view, and your continued thought and action.  On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and on behalf of a grateful nation, Zbig, we thank you. Now, it is my great honor to present the Department of Defense highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, to Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski. Thank you.

"Nov. 11, 2016","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.  First of all, these are hard acts to follow, so let’s just take a moment and recognize these five folks.  I’m inspired by you guys, really am, thanks.  And I’m going to tell you – they told great stories from today – and I’m going to start out by telling you a story from yesterday.  Long time yesterday, almost a century ago…and it goes like this: There was a 22-year-old sales clerk named Frieda Greene.  Frieda Greene was sitting at her family’s dinner table in Portsmouth, Ohio, when her father mentioned that the U.S. Navy was recruiting women to serve in World War I.  Despite the fact that there was a world war raging at the time, Frieda said without hesitation, “That’s for me!” And while her family did not pay much attention to that exclamation, they did a few days later when she called home and said, “Mamma, I just joined the Navy!”  Though her mother objected, her father said, “Let her go.”  And go Frieda did, serving as a so-called ‘yeomanette’ in the U.S. Navy. When this beautiful memorial was being christened in 1997, almost 30,000 people came out here to honor the women who have served our country in uniform.  And at that ceremony, they  heard from  101-year-old veteran Frieda Greene, and she spoke that day about what her service had meant to her…at the other end of life’s arc from these spectacular women we’ve heard from today.  And she encouraged – like they did – others to serve as well.  To those women serving at the time, and those women thinking of military service, she echoed her father’s words, and told them, “Go for it.” And so, General McWilliams, ladies and gentlemen, veterans and servicemembers, DoD leaders and colleagues, family and friends – today, we come together to honor once again all those who’ve gone for it, and gone for all of us.  Servicemembers like those who shared their stories with us a moment ago and others here today.  As we do, we remember those who’ve served in the past, we reaffirm our dedication to the force today, and we also recommit ourselves to building the force of the future. The men and women of today’s force and the force of the future will inherit a remarkable legacy.  Since the nation’s founding, each of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and veterans – men and women… active, guard, and reserve – has done one of the noblest things a person can do with their life, which is to help defend our magnificent country and make a better world for our children.  And along the way, as the world and war have changed, they’ve fought when necessary, adapted to fit the times, and prepared for the future. Together, they won for the United States its independence in the Revolutionary War, and they helped bring America back together in the Civil War.  They fought in the Great War, whose armistice we also mark today, and later won the Second World War.  Then they went on to serve with distinction all over the globe – in the waters off Korea, in the jungles of Vietnam, and in the desert sands of Kuwait, just to name a few.  And, of course, since September 11th, some 4.9 million Americans have joined our military to serve in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere...including as we sit here right now this afternoon. While some continue to serve today, many others have chosen to leave the armed forces.  Now, as Secretary of Defense, I have to tell you that’s not always easy for me, because I hate to see our great people go…but at the same time, here’s how I console myself, and remember that it’s a good thing.  Because when they transition to a good job, or start their own business, or work in public service, or volunteer in their community, they show future generations that the military can be more than a good place to be; it’s also a good place to be from.  And that has tremendous value as we recruit their replacements.  And you know, I remember a time when it was different.  I’m old enough to remember a time when it was different, and I’m so proud today that our employers and our citizens recognize what spectacular contributors our veterans are. That’s one of many reasons why DoD is committed to helping our servicemembers transition when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life, so that they can succeed – we can help them succeed – in every way possible.  Because while we know it’s a loss for our military, we also know our country will gain from their contributions from their amazing skills and discipline and experience, when these dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen become dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable veterans.  And as they do, they’re always part of our team, and we wish them well, we honor them, and we thank them – as a department, as a military, and as an ever-grateful nation. Now, those who follow in their footsteps of all those veterans – that is our men and women serving today – comprise, no other way to say it, the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And we need that excellence, because today we’re confronting no fewer than five immediate, unique, and evolving challenges. They, for us, are countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific region – the single region of greatest consequence for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued missile and nuclear provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  They’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Syria and Iraq, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as they help protect our people here in the homeland.  And they’re preparing, moreover, to contend, with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not even anticipate today. All that, they’re doing for us as we sit here now. And as Secretary of Defense, my first commitment is to our people, to our men and women in uniform because I know that’s what makes our military the greatest – committed to their excellence, and to their welfare – to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost reflection and care. I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and readiness of today’s force – investing in the right training, the right force size, the right equipment, and the right compensation and benefits that our troops, military families, and DoD civilians deserve. And of course, our support for today’s force includes our commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured, and support our military families, because they serve, too.  It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us and our country, like those laid to rest here at Arlington.  And it also includes what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military. Now, even as our force of today is outstanding and meeting the challenges we face, the Pentagon has to continue to adapt and change to build what I call the force of the future and – to think as I like to say outside of our five-sided box – to ensure we stay the best.  And we can’t take that for granted, because as generations change, as technology changes, and as labor markets change, as kids change, we need to stay competitive and continue to attract and retain the most talented young people that America has to offer. And we’re doing that with several changes to the management of the talent of our all-volunteer force, but given this setting here today, I’ll focus on one part of this effort – my decision almost a year ago to open up all combat positions to women without exception. I made this decision so we can benefit from the service of every American who can meet our high standards and contribute to our mission.  In the 21st century, and in an all-volunteer force, that requires us to be able to draw talent from the broadest possible pool of qualified Americans.  And that includes women, because they make up more than 50 percent of our population. To succeed in our mission therefore, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half of the country’s talents and skills.  We have to take full advantage of every individual who can meet our standards.  That is mission critical. Any woman who qualifies can now contribute to our mission in ways they could not before.  They can drive tanks, they can fire mortars, they can lead infantry soldiers into combat.  They can serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men. And as a result, any woman in uniform will be able to realize her full potential.  That’s important because while we had previously benefitted from the skills and perspectives of women, like Yeomanette Frieda Greene a century ago and millions of others, they had long only been allowed to serve in limited roles or had limited  opportunities simply because of their gender.  That was bad talent management, and it also wrong.  And that’s why we ended it. And now, I’m proud to say that everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country, and who can meet our high standards, has the full and equal opportunity to do so. So today, we honor every American, and now that’s a wider group, every American who has stepped forward to serve…those like Frieda Greene who did long ago.  The more than 20 million veterans living today.  And the more than 2 million Americans serving in uniform at this very moment across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, and in every domain…in the air, ashore, afloat, in cyberspace – all in service to this great nation. You know, it’s said that security is like oxygen…when you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it. But when you don’t have it, you can think of nothing else.  America’s servicemembers have long provided the oxygen…the security that allows millions and millions of people, not just in America, but in so much of the world to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full, and to leave behind a better world. In each of the five challenges, and at a time of great change and competition in our world, we must and will continue to provide that oxygen. To do so, we’ve changed how we plan and how we operate, how we fight and whom we allow to do the fighting, but we’ll never change what we’re fighting for:  for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies, and for our values and principles. Our people make all of that possible.  Whether they’ve served years ago, are serving right now, or are just joining what will be our force of the future, I couldn’t be prouder of our men and women for what they do every day – and for what they have done – for us.  Stephanie and I wake up for them every morning. Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service is invaluable.  And their sacrifices will never be forgotten. May God bless them.  May God bless the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.

"Oct. 5, 2015","Thank you, Minister Morenés. I’m going to try to do this: “mil gracias por la amistad y la hospitalidad de España.” Before I continue, I want to repeat what I said Saturday and then on the plane on the way here to Spain last night about the tragic incident at the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those touched by this tragedy, and by the violence in Kunduz. We need organizations like Doctors Without Borders, and we’ve been in touch with them to assure them that a full and transparent investigation is underway. And we’ve directed our forces in the area to make sure that all civilians who need medical care know our medical facilities are standing by to treat them. It is a particular honor to be here in Madrid today and speaking to all of you at this important institution, particularly to the students and the future leaders here today. In the coming years, the global community will depend on your insights and creative problem solving to find new avenues of international cooperation, to innovate in response to future challenges and threats, and to further enrich the partnership we celebrate today – a partnership that has benefitted so many, for so long. Because at a time when terrorism knows no borders…when vicious and hateful ideologies can spread over cyberspace…when state and non-state actors alike can acquire high-end military capabilities, exploit instability for their own gains… at times like these, no single nation can go it alone and hope to provide their people with the peace and security it takes for them live their lives, and dream their dreams. In order to do that today, nations have to be willing to cooperate and work together to help make a better world for everyone. Today’s security environment requires the kind of enduring and positive connections we’ve had for decades with Spain, our fellow NATO allies, and many other nations around the world. And the nature of these connections is two-fold – they are networked, and they are principled. And America, for its part, plats a winning, strong and often leading role in them. Indeed, the problems our nations face today are not geographically limited. Their solutions are not purely military, though that is frequently a necessary part. And they are best dealt with through networked, multi-lateral partnerships – NATO being an example of one. While the NATO model cannot and should not be applied everywhere, the agile, adaptive teamwork it exemplifies makes a powerful argument for deepening and strengthening existing partnerships in response to an evolving world. Depending on where they are in the world, these kinds of networked connections among nations will inevitably take on many forms – from formal alliances and coalitions such as in Europe and the Middle East, to a shared regional security architecture in the Asia-Pacific. And that’s okay. Because however and wherever these connections are made, the United States will continue to do what we’ve done for many years: We will cultivate cooperative security partnerships that are strong enough, capable enough, and connected enough to give nations and their peoples the security and the opportunity to rise and thrive in this still young century. Now, in order to be effective, these teams have to be two-way streets, where each member makes a greater effort to carry and contribute their fair share, spanning from capabilities that are needed for success today, to investments that are needed for success tomorrow. To borrow a concept from information technology, an modern effective security alliance must be at its core a distributed architecture, one capable of balancing the load and routing demands between voluntary participants in order to provide the flexibility to handle unforeseen challenges. That’s what a network really is. And that’s an alliance at its best. By their very nature, networks are much more responsive to changes that occur in the world around them. And as the past months have shown in stark detail, the world around us is anything but static. In this context, the United States and Spain are lucky to be NATO member states, because our historic transatlantic alliance has shown time and again that it has the capacity and agility to adapt and respond to new challenges and threats with cooperative approaches. And adapt and respond we must, because today, NATO faces significant challenges and threats from multiple directions – emanating from both the South and the East. These challenges are equally important, both to the NATO alliance and to the United States. They’re also very different, and they require different responses that test the agility and adaptability of our alliance. Here on NATO’s southern flank, nations like Spain are contending with the ripple effects of ISIL and other extremists exploiting instability in the Middle East and North Africa, with terrorism and state instability putting tremendous pressures on the region. People seeking work and opportunity, and entire families flee for the safety of Europe, overwhelming the ability of many nations to help them. Thousands of radicalized individuals have left Europe to fight in Syria and Iraq, and some have tried to return. The 20th century playbook was successful in creating a Europe whole, free and at peace, but it isn’t going to help us respond to these complex challenges. Together we must write a new playbook for the 21st century, one that confronts the root causes of instability, and embraces cooperation – not only through bilateral relations between two nations, but also through fostering teamwork among nations and institutions. Together we are working with our partners in the European Union, which has shown leadership in areas such as humanitarian aid and coordination with non-government organizations in the face of the migrant crisis. And later this week, my fellow NATO defense ministers and I will meet with the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Frederica Mogherini, to discuss how NATO and the EU can further strengthen our cooperation. We are, of course, also working through NATO, where next year Spain will lead NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, or VJTF, the spearhead element in the enhanced NATO Response Force which I visited earlier this summer. And we are working together bilaterally with Spain, in a partnership that gives us greater ability to react swiftly and effectively to a crisis. The U.S. Navy Aegis destroyers at Rota provide NATO protection against missile threats. And tomorrow, Minister Morenés and I will visit the U.S. Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force stationed in Morón. The United States is very grateful to Spain for this task force, and we are also grateful to Italy for hosting its forward-deployed assets and personnel in Sigonella, Italy, which I will visit tomorrow as well. Because having this task force based in Spain and Italy on the frontiers of the Southern flank gives us the flexibility and reach to respond swiftly to dangerous events anywhere in the Mediterranean and North Africa. I want to personally thank Minister Morenés for his hard work in securing the latest amendment to our Agreement on Defense Cooperation. Having additional U.S. military personnel at Morón over the long term will create new opportunities for joint cooperation, and it will be vital as we address the full spectrum of threats and challenges to Europe’s South and East. Spain’s leadership today reflects the enduring global character that it’s had throughout history. And for Spain to continue that legacy and as its economy steadily strengthens, it’s important to continue to invest in the people and capabilities that make it happen. As Minister Morenés and I noted, that includes meeting the pledge that all NATO allies made last year to invest 2 percent of our GDP on defense. We all made that commitment to each other, and we all have a responsibility to live up to it – not only Spain, but every NATO ally. We’re also working in partnership with Spain to stem the flow of foreign fighters and counter ISIL’s online messaging, recruitment, and the spread of its loathsome ideology. This is critical in today’s connected and networked world, and I’m looking forward to seeing it in action when I visit Spain’s cyber counterterrorism center later this afternoon. ISIL poses a grave threat to Europe, the United States and our friends and allies around the world because of its steady metastasis and its evil intentions. That is why we formed a global coalition of over 60 nations, including Spain, to deny ISIL its safe haven and deliver it a lasting defeat. This coalition has conducted over 7,300 airstrikes, hampering ISIL's movement and operations and systematically targeting this terrorist group's leadership. And coalition strikes have helped enable operations by a variety of counter-ISIL forces on the ground in Syria, including Syrian Arabs, Kurds, and other groups. And the coalition is now identifying other capable and motivated local forces which it can similarly enable. Those groups have achieved notable success against ISIL, particularly along the Turkey-Syria border. In Iraq, coalition efforts include airstrikes as well as advising Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and providing additional training and equipment. And in support of these efforts, the Department of Defense will also provide up to $125 million worth of humanitarian supplies including logistical support for refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and internally displaced persons in Iraq. To the east, Russia has used political, economic, and military tools to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring countries, flouted international legal norms, and destabilized the European security order by attempting to annex Crimea and continuing to fuel further violence in eastern Ukraine. In response, the United States and our allies are taking a strong and balanced strategic approach. We will take all necessary steps to deter Russia’s malign and destabilizing influence, coercion, and aggression, including its efforts to undermine strategic stability and challenge the military balance in Europe. And at the same time, we will continue to be open to cooperating with Russia where our interests align, and we will leave the door open for Russia to rejoin the community of respectable nations. To do this, we’ll leverage strong and modern U.S. forces – the finest fighting force the world has even known – and an adaptive and agile NATO working from a new play book, which includes preparing to counter new challenges, like cyber and hybrid warfare, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to help facilitate training and exercises and help make our forces more mobile and responsive. And we will continue to make it clear that if Russia wants to end its international isolation and be considered a responsible global power, it must stop its aggression in eastern Ukraine, end its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea, and live up to its commitments under the Minsk agreements. On top of their behavior in Ukraine, Russia's behavior in Syria concerning, and crosswise with the right course of action. As I recently told Russian Minister of Defense Shoygu, there is a contradiction in the logic of the Russian position and its actions in Syria. Russia says it intends to fight ISIL on the one hand but support Bashar al-Assad on the other. By taking military action in Syria against moderate groups targets, Russia has escalated the civil war, putting further at risk the very political resolution and preservation of Syria’s structure of future governance it says that it wants. This approach is tantamount to pouring gasoline on the fire of civil war. It’s important to remember that the civil war in Syria began because of Asad’s deficiencies as a leader. He responded to peaceful protests with extraordinary violence. He dropped barrel bombs on villages, and demonstrated a willingness to destroy his nation in a desperate bid to control it. His actions uprooted millions families, and fueled the chaos which gave rise to ISIL. He cannot be rehabilitated in the eyes of the Syrian people. So as Russia continues to violate international law and alienate the international community, it is doing so in service to a goal that cannot be achieved. The Asad regime cannot last – the only question is what will happen to Syria and the region when it falls. The United States’ position is clear that a lasting defeat of ISIL and extremism in Syria can only be achieved if pursued in parallel with a political transition in Syria. And we will continue to insist on the importance of simultaneously pursuing these two objectives. The coalitions operations against ISIL are continuing unchanged. It remains my hope that Russia will see that tethering Russia to a sinking ship is a losing strategy, and will decide to confront the threat presented by ISIL instead of continuing its unilateral airstrikes against Assad’s opposition. In the meantime, we call on Russia to act in a safe and professional manner, uphold international standards for safety, and respect the sovereignty of all nations -- most recently our NATO ally, Turkey. Russia has an opportunity to be part of the right side of history in resolving the situation in Syria, just as it was in 1995 when I worked with the Russian Minister of Defense to ensure that it joined NATO in bringing peace to Bosnia. And when we worked together to control the spread of nuclear weapons following the cold war. And more recently, Russia has hosted a key NATO supply route into Afghanistan. People in the United States, here in Europe, and in Russia, all benefited from that collaboration and progress. That’s why we’ll keep the door open for cooperation with Russia. But it’s up to the Kremlin to decide. In addition, successful security cooperation today must be more than networked – it must also be principled. There is a reason why Russia finds itself clinging to a coalition of two in Syria, while Spain and the United States enjoy the support of 60 nations. The positive and enduring partnerships the United States and Spain have cultivated through NATO and around the world are built upon our common values, and reflect the way we conduct ourselves. Nations know what we stand for. They know how we do things and why. They know we treat them as equals, and we take their interests into account. It is clear that we do things better when we do them together. That’s why Spain and the United States are doing so much together, both bilaterally and multi-laterally with broader institutions, working together to make our countries more secure and our citizens safer. That’s why Spain has been a strong partner in Afghanistan, and why we’ve worked together in Iraq to train Iraqi security forces. That’s also why we have partners like Italy, where I will visit this week, working with us in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Lebanon, leading the European Union migrant mission in the Mediterranean and offering to lead a stability mission in Libya. And it’s why both Spain and Italy are hosting the task force I mentioned, providing us agility, flexibility and global reach while nations like Russia and China continue to limit themselves by going it alone. These are times when it is essential to be in an agile and principled alliance with a history of strength and leadership. It is essential to have strong coalitions, ready and able to tackle difficult challenges. These are times when the principles that guide us also provide the foundation on which we build new solutions to new problems that are bigger than any one country. These solutions will not come easy, and they will not come quick. But as I mentioned, we’ve been here before. And as we approach the 20th Anniversary of the Dayton Accords, it’s important to remember what a coalition of nations achieved when they recognized the need to respond beyond their borders, to a crisis with no obvious end in sight, more complicated than before, one that forced mothers, fathers, and children to the open road in search of hope. They found hope in the NATO alliance. They found hope in the support provided by our coalitions, and in the stalwart support of the international community. And in time they found their way home. That is why the United States will continue to reach out and deepen our partnerships and alliances. That is why the United States will continue to invest in the world’s greatest fighting force. Because we know that the only way to succeed in a 21st century security environment is for countries to come together and work together to solve problems as a team. We must do so today. The United States and Spain do that. And for that I am very grateful to our good friends in Spain. Thank you very much. ","Remarks at Spanish Center for Advanced Studies of National Defense: ""Strong and Principled Security Cooperation""",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/621829/remarks-at-spanish-center-for-advanced-studies-of-national-defense-strong-and-p/
"March 23, 2015","Good Morning. President Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah, Secretary Kerry, members of our armed forces…and all members of the DoD family: In 1999, after almost a decade in uniform, Lieutenant Lonn Larson retired as a Navy Flight Officer, and launched a successful, private-sector career. But he felt like his service to his country wasn't complete. So more than a decade after leaving active duty, he decided to return to the Navy as a reservist.  Last May, he was called up for duty, and as we gather today in the Pentagon Courtyard, Lieutenant Commander Larson is serving in eastern Afghanistan, where he deployed nine months ago. While Lieutenant Commander Larson is away, his wife of almost 20 years, Mary Ann, has left her job to spend more time with her 9-year-old daughter Reese. Mary Ann and Reese have sent a care package to dad every single week, and they can't wait for him to come home in about a month. But for all the hardship of having her husband away, Mary Ann says that Lieutenant Commander Larson’s deployment has become an opportunity to teach Reese how blessed and lucky we are as Americans; to explain what would happen if no one answered the call to service; and to talk about the kind of future we want all Afghans to have –especially young girls Reese’s age. And we're honored to have Mary Ann and Reese here today. A month after Lieutenant Commander Larson deployed to Afghanistan, a promising young soldier, Captain Jeremy Haynes, was in his fourth month as aide-de-camp to Major General Harold Greene, the commanding general of U.S. Combined Security Transition Command. As many of you know, General Greene was tragically killed on August 5, 2014 in Afghanistan. Captain Haynes was with General Greene the day they came under fire and suffered multiple, life-threatening wounds – that left him unconscious and paralyzed below the waist. His prognosis was so dire that his wife, Chelsea, was told to be ready to fly to Germany as he underwent multiple operations. But through grace and grit, Captain Haynes regained consciousness after he arrived at Walter Reed about a week later.  And despite the odds, a day before New Year's Eve, his family celebrated…because five months after he was wounded, Captain Haynes took his first steps again. And just one month later, he and Chelsea celebrated the birth of their third child, Jordon Harold Haynes, named after General Greene. Captain Haynes is now resolved to pass the Army's physical fitness test –not just for himself –but also as he says, to “be a rock…a motivation…and a torch” for all soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that he's met – and no doubt inspired – up at Walter Reed, where I first met him. We're honored this morning to have Captain Haynes, his wife Chelsea, and his son Jordon here.  And we're also honored to have Jordon's godmother, the widow of General Greene, retired Army Colonel Susan Myers. As we tell the stories of the Larson, Haynes, and Greene families, we recognize that there are millions of stories like theirs…stories of duty, honor, sacrifice and sometimes of grief and tragedy because over 850,000 American troops and civilians and thousands more contractors, have served and sacrificed in Afghanistan since 2001.  And so have their families alongside them. Today we also recognize the sacrifices of Afghan security forces. And we remember the 2,215 Americans who paid the ultimate price during the course of the conflict in Afghanistan –and their spouses, parents, sons and daughters.  We remember that they gave their lives defending our nation's security.  And in this courtyard, we're also reminded why they went to Afghanistan in the first place.  Because just beyond these walls, stands a memorial honoring all those who perished when the Pentagon was attacked on that bright, fateful day in 2001. Our guest this morning, President Ghani, knows this history well. And on behalf of all Afghans, he is here today to thank you and to thank all the Americans whose service has not only kept the United States secure, but also given hope and opportunity to his countrymen as well. But before I turn it over to President Ghani, let me say a few words about him. President Ghani has led an extraordinary life, and he has deep ties to the United States. As a young man, he won a fellowship to study at the American University [of] Beirut where he met his wife, Rula. He pursued his doctorate and has taught at some of America's finest universities. Through some of Afghanistan's darkest days – whenthe Soviet Union invaded and occupied his country… when many of his family members were persecuted and jailed…President Ghani always guarded his faith in a brighter future for his country. As a scholar, he studied state-building and how to break the cycle of conflict.  And as a practitioner at the World Bank of the United Nations, he applied those lessons–managing large-scale economic development projects in countries like India and China, and helping ease the transition in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. When the opportunity came to write a new chapter in Afghanistan's history, PresidentGhani –without hesitation –left his comfortable life as a scholar and policymaker and returned to his home.  First, to lead Kabul University, then to serve as finance minister, creating one of the most comprehensive economic development programs ever proposed.  Along the way, always focused on the future, he co-authored one of the most comprehensive studies of peace agreements around the world. His initiatives as President now of his country, are well-known. But there also the smaller, telling details: He's known for meetings that culminate in decisions, and not just discussion.  He orders snap inspections.  He personally holds government officials to their word – and to account. In short, he demonstrates that public service is a public trust. And along with Dr. Abdullah, President Ghani has made clear to the Afghan people that for all the assistance that the United States, our military, and the international community can and will furnish, Afghanistan's future is ultimately for the Afghans to grab hold of…and for Afghans to decide. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to introduce the President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani. ",Remarks Introducing Afghan President Ashraf Ghani,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606656/remarks-introducing-afghan-president-ashraf-ghani/
"May 25, 2015","Mr. President; Chairman and Mrs. Dempsey; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: To our Gold Star Families – the families of America’s fallen heroes, in attendance here, and across our grateful nation – it is truly our honor to be standing with you on this solemn, sacred day. We your fellow Americans lack the words to describe what you feel today, because try as we may – and try as we do – we can never fully know. But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to this nation, and to a world that still depends so much on American men and women in uniform for its security. As we gather here this morning, I’m reminded of the words of one of our presidents, a veteran who himself rests not a 10-minute walk from here, President John F. Kennedy. In this very amphitheater, he once said, quote, “these quiet grounds, this cemetery and others like it all around the world, remind us with pride of our obligation and our opportunity.” On a day set aside for Americans to honor and remember those who perished while serving our country, our obligation and our opportunity are one and the same. Our obligation is to give voice to the fallen, honor them, and share their stories of sacrifice and heroism. Our opportunity is to use this day to inspire new generations to understand the freedom they have been given, to grasp how and why it is theirs, and to dedicate themselves to pass it on to generations unborn. Reflect, for a moment, on the way our nation’s flag is flown on Memorial Day. First it is hoisted briskly to the top, with the same clarity of purpose we see in all those who step forward to join our all-volunteer force. Then it is solemnly, soberly lowered to half-staff, a tribute to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. But it doesn’t stay there. At noon, it is raised back toward the sky – signaling our will to recover after tragedy, and symbolizing the great strength and resilience that characterizes not only our nation, but also those who defend it, and their families. So today, when we watch the American flag fully ascend once again, our thoughts will be with our servicemembers both lost and living – including the nearly 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines beyond our shores as we gather here, so ably protecting us far from home. They too join us in mourning the fallen. They too join us in celebrating our strength. And like those we remember today, they too serve in a long line of patriots who fought in places like Lexington and Concord; Gettysburg and Midway; and, more recently, Fallujah and Helmand – a legacy that has made our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Troops of such caliber demand great leaders, and there’s no doubt they have one in our Commander-in-Chief. I see that every day. He knows well the challenges we must face, the obligations we must meet, and the opportunities we must seize in order to keep our nation safe and to make a better world for our children. And I see that he cares deeply about the safety, welfare, and dignity of our men and women in uniform and their families. For all that, and so much more, I am tremendously proud to serve as his Secretary of Defense. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my great privilege to introduce the President of the United States, Barack Obama. ",Remarks at Memorial Day Observance,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606673/remarks-at-memorial-day-observance/
"Sept. 11, 2014","Good afternoon.  Thank you for the reminder, it seems like just yesterday that I had the privilege of being sworn in by the Mayor of the Pentagon, Mike Rhodes. The world has a way of directing our attention and developing our priorities, and I don’t think any of us a year and a half ago would have envisioned the world of challenges we now face as a nation and as a community of nations—challenges that face all of our world.  I am privileged to be part of your team and I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of your team. Earlier this morning, the President, Chairman Dempsey and I, and other DoD leaders, gathered with the families of 9/11 victims at the Pentagon Memorial.  Many of you were there. This afternoon, we come together as a Pentagon community—mindful that 9/11 has a special resonance to all who work in this building. Whether or not we knew any of the Pentagon workers who lost their lives on 9/11, we feel that loss—their family’s loss—deeply today. Just like those of you gathered here, they came to work every day in service to our nation, playing vital roles to help keep our country safe.  We will never forget their ultimate sacrifice.  The sacrifices of their families.  Their memories will inspire us as we continue to do our jobs every day. To the families of the victims who have joined us today, know that your loved ones remain in our hearts and leave behind a remarkable legacy of service and dedication to this country.  To the injured survivors who join us today, we draw strength from your resilience, your courage, and your recovery. And to the first responders who are here with us today; thank you for your swift and decisive actions that day, putting yourselves in harm’s way, disregarding your own safety.  You saved lives and this entire community is grateful to you. That day also holds unique significance here in the Department of Defense because it began more than a decade of wars overseas, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, as well as many other operations across the globe. Our men and women here in the Pentagon supported those efforts day in and day out.  And we still support many of those operations and our men and women all over the world.  Those who survived the attacks awoke the next day with a new mission: to ensure that similar attacks on our country never happen again. Thirteen years have passed since that tragic day, and the world is a very different place than it was on that clear September morning thirteen years ago. But America and its allies are still being tested.  There are still those who wish to do us harm.  We have the capacity – we have the strength – to meet these challenges.  America has always had challenges, and we have always met those challenges before.  And for all the challenges we face, America and our allies still have within our grasp the potential to do more good for more people than history has ever known. How we fulfill that promise depends on our readiness and our resolve—the same readiness and resolve demonstrated by those who faced the fire on 9/11, and in the wars that followed. We have the most dedicated workforce in the world here at the Defense Department.  We must continue our hard work to protect the lives of all Americans, our country, and honor the memory of those we lost 13 years ago.  We must stay ready and we must stay resolute. Thank you for your continuing dedication and service.  Thanks to your families for their sacrifice. God bless you all and your families. Thank you very much.

"Sept. 9, 2015","Thanks, Arati, and thanks, all of you, each and every one of you, for being here today for this exciting event.  You know, I actually hired Arati three years ago, and I’ll tell you, I’ve never regretted it.  She’s been a fantastic DARPA director – the right leader at a moment of huge opportunity for DARPA and for our entire defense mission. What a great mix of people you are.  To me, this reminds me of the cross-section of brilliant people like yourselves from companies, universities, research labs, and government that in times past, before I even came on, helped create the Internet, GPS, and before that the jet engine and communications satellites – innovations that had enormous benefits not only for our security, but also benefitted our entire society and the entire globe. A few minutes ago, as Arati said, I had the privilege of meeting some of the “Risers” who just rose here to be recognized.  And when I spoke with them – and frankly when I look out on this crowd – I was reminded of how, and why, I got into this business.  I was about 25, and had recently gotten my doctorate in physics, when I then saw the Pentagon’s then-undersecretary of defense of technology and acquisition give a speech at a physics conference about how technical thinking and technology could be applied to national security problems.  And I kind of went on a lark, I didn’t have that kind of background.  That undersecretary was Bill Perry, who later became Deputy Secretary of Defense and then Secretary of Defense in a progression I followed some 30 years later.  He’s been a major figure in my life – a mentor, a friend, stood in for my father at my wedding. You’ve probably all had people like that in your own lives. And he helped me realize that I could apply my technical knowledge and technical skills to contribute to something bigger than myself – defending the country and making a better world for our children. And that caught with me, and I think it has caught with the Risers I met earlier, and for all of you.  This audience represents one of America’s great strengths – a fusion of our national security endeavor at the Defense Department, and the wonderful, innovative, open technology community of companies and universities that have done so much for this country.  You’re one of the reasons why I feel so hopeful about America’s future.  And it’s because of you that I wanted to make sure that I was here today at the opening of this conference. Arati and your team at DARPA did exactly the right thing by not doing this in Washington – there’s a reason I often say that we in the Pentagon need to think outside our five-sided box.  Because innovation is happening all over the country…on the east coast, the west coast, and here in the heartland of America.  It’s happening in traditional defense companies like the one here in St. Louis, Boeing, that I happened to visit earlier today. And in some areas of technology, it’s happening most quickly in commercial start-ups and in non-defense companies.  Point is, DoD has to tap into all those streams of innovation and emerging technology, and it has to do so much more quickly – and that’s why a conference like this is so important to the department and the mission. This forum gives new meaning to the Spirit of St. Louis.  Here – in the hometown of Lindbergh, the launching pad of Lewis and Clark, the gateway to the West – you have the chance to help continue our pioneering journey as Americans: innovating, investing, and partnering to secure our nation’s place on the leading edge of technology’s newest frontiers. More than making real what seems only possible, you’re going to break through the boundaries of the seemingly impossible.  Because that’s what DARPA does every day. And the stories are just incredible. Take computer scientist professor Kathleen Fisher, who’s sitting here somewhere this afternoon. Is Kathleen here? Where’s Kathleen? You all can see her but I can’t – ah, okay. So, Kathleen Fisher. After years in a corporate research lab, she came to DARPA for a three-year tour in 2011, where she launched a program that uses so-called formal methods to make certain software – like the code behind the physical control systems of an airplane or self-driving car – to help them become mathematically, provably un-hackable.  DARPA’s already made some of that source code openly available online, because this will matter for much more than defense – it can give the Internet of Things a critical foundation of cybersecurity, which it’s going to need. Evan Fortunato, also here today – where are you, Evan? – Evan contributed through a different route.  He came to DARPA from the defense industry, where he worked on a highly classified project that proved critical to the military’s cyber mission.  And now he’s running his own company. Then there’s Jeff Rogers. Jeff? He’s a physicist, they never do what they’re told. Anyway, he’s a physicist who came to DARPA in 2008 for a five-year tour. …When our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were getting injured by roadside bombs that caused traumatic brain injury, or TBI, Jeff came up with the Blast Gauge – a device that’s barely larger than a bottle cap that soldiers wear to capture data during explosions and better identify those who need emergency neurological care.  Jeff was intrigued by a new DARPA discovery – one so counter to conventional wisdom that a lot of people didn’t believe it at the time – and that is, that TBI can be caused by just being exposed to the blast wave, without the soldier getting, as was previously thought, their head as a whole accelerated as it does, so to speak, from whiplash or banging their head when a bomb goes off.  So he combined commercially available pressure sensors, accelerometers, and red, yellow, and green LEDs – pretty simple ingredients – that would help medics triage the wounded, and he got them developed, tested, and in the field in just 11 months. And this in a war – that’s how fast you need to do things when you’re in a war, because people’s lives depend on it. He knew it, and DARPA knew it. Jeff works at Google now, but over the last four years, tens of thousands of American troops have been equipped with those Blast Gauges – helping them to get faster treatment for what is sadly one of the signature wounds of the wars of the last decade and a half, while also giving doctors a clearer picture of how TBI occurs. The work that Kathleen, Evan, and Jeff did with DARPA either already has, or soon will, make a real difference in the lives of our men and women in uniform.  And we’re very grateful for that.  Because first and foremost, it’s our people – the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines – who make America’s military the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  More than anything else, they are the ones who make it great. But secondly, and importantly, our strength also comes from the long-standing link between the technology community and the government.  And that’s why I’ve made building and rebuilding the bridges between us one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense.  Because going forward, we need the best people, the best technology, and the best innovation to remain the world’s finest fighting force. Over most of the last 75 years, the bonds between us have been remarkably close.  I’ve observed that from seeing it from both sides – as a technologist myself, and also serving a number of times in the Defense Department.  But while our ties have endured through successes and strains, the challenges and opportunities we face today demand we strengthen our partnership, and it has to be in ways that benefit us both. We live in a changing world, and our military’s excellence is not a birthright.  It’s not a guarantee.  We have to earn it again and again. When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and a lot of that was sponsored by the government, especially the Department of Defense.  Today, much more of our technology is commercial, and the technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up to the breakthroughs – many of which DARPA helped develop – that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. Indeed, technologies once long possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors.  Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the gap and erode our superiority in every domain – air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.  And at the same time, our reliance on things like satellites and the Internet has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. So to stay ahead of those challenges, and stay the best, we’re investing aggressively in innovation. As you’ll see this week, we’re pushing the envelope with research into both new technologies, and innovative ways to apply them.  And whether it’s robotics, data science, cyber defense, biotech, or hypersonic engines that can fly over five times the speed of sound, DARPA’s work is going to be critical to our future. We’re also at the same time drilling tunnels through that wall that sometimes seems to separate government from scientists and commercial technologists – that wall, making it more permeable so more of America’s brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time, or on and off in the course of their careers.  DARPA is a model for one of the methods we’re working on, which is using on-ramps and off-ramps to bring aboard some of the best people in the most promising fields, and also have some of our people learn from outside about ways that we can do things better. Because – I always remind people of this – we don’t build anything in the Pentagon, we’re also, because of that, we’re developing new technologies of necessity with America’s private sector and tech communities.  And this forum is a part of that.  That’s our system.  We’ve also opened up a DoD innovation hub in Silicon Valley, where, just less than two weeks ago, I launched a partnership with over 100 companies, universities, and labs across the country to propel manufacturing of flexible hybrid electronics.  And we’re making ourselves open, more open, and we have to make ourselves more agile, to work with start-ups, commercial companies, and small businesses in a way that is compatible with their business practices and their business needs. And as we do, the American defense industrial base that’s long made our military strong, that will continue to be critical.  Earlier today I was, as I mentioned earlier, at the Boeing facility, which is across town, where I met with our industry partners and saw some of their innovative manufacturing techniques and cutting-edge technologies coming out of their Phantom Works.  Like all of you, and also like the many researchers and engineers doing game-changing work in DoD labs across the country, they’re also proof that American ingenuity is alive and well in the 21st century. There, as in universities, as in laboratories, as in small companies throughout the ecosystem. I also want our partnerships with the private sector to be a two-way street – where it’s not only – where it’s not all about what we have in government to gain, but also what we all have to offer.  Whether they’re time-tested relationships we’ve had for decades, like with Boeing, or new ones we’re just forging here at this conference, there’s a lot DoD can learn from our industry and tech community partners – including, another thing I talked about this morning, how to manage top technical talent.  That’s been a particular focus of mine as we build DoD’s force of the future, and I expect to begin making some decisions on it soon. At the same time that DoD is learning from industry, there’s also ways we can be helpful in return, like incentivizing companies to think more about applying their expertise to some of the vexing problems we’re trying to solve day in and day out at the Department of Defense through rapid seed funding.  That’s something DARPA has long excelled at, and we need to have more of that kind of agility across the Defense Department. Because we each have different missions and somewhat different perspectives, sometimes we may disagree.  And I think that’s okay.  Whether we’re developing a new product, or a new policy, the lesson to me is always the same:  vigorous debate and exchange produce breakthrough ideas.  One area where that’s particularly true is cyber, where DoD’s mission is first and foremost to defend our networks, and where we all have a stake in making sure the Internet remains open, secure, and prosperous.  And that means we must continue to respect, and protect, the freedoms of expression, association, and privacy that reflect who we are as a nation. Still, our success in all of this – from investing in new technologies to building new partnerships – will depend on the Defense Department having a robust budget and long-term budget certainty.  Both are essential to having the best troops and the best technology.  Indiscriminate cuts from sequestration – not to mention a continuing resolution – are wasteful for taxpayers, dangerous for our strategy, unfair for our people, and frankly, embarrassing in front of the world.  Even though I’m not in Washington, I need to say that we need for Washington to come together behind a multi-year approach to our budgeting, and we got to start that right now. Now, we talk a lot in the Pentagon about wanting to tap into the innovation ecosystems of America – the Silicon Valleys, the Bostons, the Research Triangles, and so on.  And the truth is, over the next couple days, this convention center is going to be its own innovation ecosystem.  You’re some of the nation’s most innovative and inventive physicists, chemists, and geneticists; nanotechnologists, molecular biologists, data scientists, computer scientists, neuroscientists; experts in manufacturing, in cyber, in satellites, and in space, and I could go on.  With all of you in this one building, the opportunities for cross-collaboration are endless.  So are the possibilities for what you can achieve. My charge to you is this:  Take advantage of being together. Take advantage of this close proximity. Don’t wait to ask someone what they do.  Talk to each other, forge relationships, share new ideas – ideas that might be thought impossible anywhere else, but could change the world with the right amount of focus.  When you go home, keep the connections alive and the conversations going.  And as you keep in touch with each other, keep in touch with us, too – and you can keep in touch with me, you can leave me a note on Facebook or LinkedIn, if you want. Conferences and forums like this are critical to our ability to share information and break down barriers that block innovation.  While budgetary constraints have led to restrictions on these kinds of activities in recent years, I believe that is counterproductive.  The Defense Department must be able to have our scientists and researchers come together with others, like those of you here today, to promote a free exchange of ideas that drives innovation forward.  So I’m directing that DoD change our policy to make it easier, not harder, for our people to benefit more from conferences like this in the future. This is an exciting time for you to be here.  For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are tons of interesting challenges and problems to work on.  And that’s true also for those who are interested in technology.  But the intersection of the two is a particularly opportunity-rich environment. The issues you’ll work on this week matter.  They’re critical to our protection, to our security, and creating a world in which our fellow citizens can live their lives and dream their dreams and hug their children and give them a better future. Helping defend your country and making a better world is one of the noblest things a person can do.  And we’re grateful to all of you for doing that with us. Before I turn it back to Arati and go see some of what DARPA’s doing in the demo hall, let me just close by saying that in coming here today, you are standing on the shoulders of history. In 1904, as it turns out, right here in St. Louis, the World’s Fair showcased the latest scientific and industrial achievements that would come to define the future of the then still-young twentieth century – inventions like the x-ray machine, the electric typewriter, the wireless telegraph, gasoline engine, the automobile, and the airplane.  Citizens of the world came to St. Louis and witnessed, as one historian later wrote, “the forefront of technological and educational advances…looking ahead to a new century that promised a better life.” Today, 111 years later, we stand on the verge of another still-young century, one that once again promises a better life.  The difference is, instead of showcasing the future, you’re going to help shape it.  That’s the opportunity this forum represents – and I look forward it, and I look forward to seeing what you make of it. Thank you. ","Remarks at DARPA's ""Wait, What?"" Future Technology Forum",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/616661/remarks-at-darpas-wait-what-future-technology-forum/
"May 23, 2016","It’s great to be back at Yale. This campus holds many special memories for me, and I know it will for all of you who attended and drilled here - moments, values and lessons you’ll carry with you for your entire life. This is a very important homecoming of sorts for the nation as well, with the commissioning of the first class to spend four years drilling on this magnificent campus in over four decades. I’m so happy that ROTC is back on Yale’s campus, and welcoming students from other great schools in the area as well. I remember when that was not the case, I remember it well. And I’m so gratified to be Secretary of Defense in this era, when society is very admiring of the Department of Defense and the military, and many young people are giving it serious consideration. It makes me very proud of both the military institution I lead, and the academic institution we now share in common. I want to thank Captain Kemper, for that introduction, and I want to thank your President, Peter Salovey, for inviting me to be here today. I also want to thank Governor Malloy for being here. And I want to thank all of the families here today for allowing me to share this magnificent day with you. Most of all, I want to thank the 18 remarkable men and women we honor today, for embracing the awesome responsibility of leadership, and accepting the noblest mission that I believe a young person can pursue, which is to provide security for the American people and indeed much of the rest of the world. It’s been said that security is like oxygen. When you have it, you don't think about it. But when you don't have it, it's all you can think about.  You have stepped forward to give our people that security that allows them to get up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, dream their dreams, live lives that are full. And there's no better feeling than being a part of that mission. As you step forward into a complex and changing world, our nation is counting on your constant professionalism, on your pursuit of innovation, and most of all, on your principled leadership. So before you pin on your bars, I want to take some time to discuss the strategic landscape into which you will soon figure.  Then I’d like to discuss briefly several of the lessons that I need and expect you to carry with you to the great challenges you will confront in your career. Today, we face no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving  challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Persian Gulf; and accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it’s metastasizing around the world. We don’t have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges. We have to deal with them all – and they may all affect your career in some way at different times.  Your service may span decades.  A future Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State – both Yalies - may very well be in this chapel. And history tells us that ten, twenty years from now, new challenges we don't even foresee and aren't among the ones I just named, will almost certainly arise.  To help you prepare and succeed today, and to lead and thrive in a complex and uncertain future, I want to speak briefly about four commitments that guide me, and that I want you to have and take with you wherever you go. The first commitment is to ground your training and actions in our core mission at the Department of Defense: our primary obligation will always be protecting our people and serving our nation’s interests.  When I sit with the President in the situation room, we are always focused on America’s interests because that is what matters most. And we also recognize that protecting American interests often means leading others, and leading by example.  Ever since World War II, America has been the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability in the world. It is a mantle we embraced again following the Cold War. And one that continues today to the great benefit of this nation, but also the rest of the world. The positive and enduring partnerships the United States has cultivated with other nations around the world are built on our interests. They understand that. But they can also see that it's built on our values, which most find decent, honorable and attractive. One thing I hear consistently from foreign leaders is how much they like working with the men and women of the United States military. They want to work with you not just because you're capable and competent, and have an extraordinary force, but also because of the way you conduct yourselves. They can trust you. Other nations know that you'll treat them with respect, and that we’ll take their interests into account. That trust creates opportunities to defend our own interests. So whether you're working with our Coalition partners over the skies of Syria or Iraq, or conducting exercises with our allies in the waters of the Pacific, or responding to a disaster in some far off corner of the globe, remember that your individual actions will be a clear reflection of our values and our leadership in the world. That is your opportunity, and your responsibility. In a way, you have already reflected our values through your service right here on campus. And that brings me to the second commitment I want to talk about today, and that is that it's our people who make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. As leaders in the return of ROTC to this campus, you’ve helped bridge a divide that persisted for too long. And in the process you’ve actually enhanced the education of your classmates as well as your own. For some of your classmates, you’re the first member of the military they’ve ever gotten to know – I hear the uniforms are a big hit on campus. And so you’ve already given them a perspective they never had before, just as they’ve probably expanded your perspective as well. That will continue as you maintain these friendships beyond graduation. People think differently about the world when a former roommate is managing the nuclear reactor on a submarine, or a former organic chemistry classmate is serving as a combat medic, or a fellow programmer is defending our nation’s cybersecurity. It's our people who will ensure that the force of tomorrow, which you will command, remains as great as the force of today. And we can't take that for granted. It has to be earned, again and again. That's why I'm so intent on building what I call the force of the future. We have already announced reforms, including expanded opportunities for our service members to gain outside experience and more chances for outside talent to serve our mission of national defense, and expand family policies such as maternity and paternity leave and expanded day care so as you progress in your careers, you don’t ever have to choose between family and service. And we will be announcing more reforms soon. We have to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent for our all-volunteer force -- people as fine as you -- and we need to do that as generations change, technology changes, families change, and job markets change. Our nation is strongest when we draw from all of our strengths, and when we give our best people every opportunity to serve. That’s also why we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to all of our population. Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. As you prepare to assume command, don’t ever forget that our people are our greatest strength. Recognize the caliber of those you will lead as a brand-new officer. Respect the quality of experience of the NCOs under your command. Remember their families and the sacrifices they make. And don’t ever forget that those you lead count on you to do your utmost. Third, I want you to remember that our nation's defense rests on being able to find solutions to seemingly intractable problems. And that's only going to be more so in the future. In many situations, you're going to encounter unexpected challenges. I’ve told you what we're up to today, and that's plenty. But I also told you we don't know what awaits us tomorrow, and we need to be ready for that, too. Have the courage to accept risk and solve those problems, and the wisdom to determine when that risk becomes a gamble. You're responsible for the lives of your people in the accomplishment of your mission. Balancing these two solemn duties is one of the most difficult tasks you'll face, but you've got to succeed. That's the burden of command. When you plan, rehearse, and execute your missions, you must also be able to reevaluate the situation constantly, and take a new course of action when the situation demands it. And to chart a new course, you must have the confidence to be open to new ideas, like the men who led the Yale Preparedness Movement, and became some of the first military aviators—and aces—during World War I. They included one of my predecessors, Bob Lovett, who organized the production of the planes, and the training of the men, that would be decisive in World War II. At the Pentagon, I've made it a priority to encourage people at all levels to think outside what I call our five-sided box, because we are a learning organization. The culture of learning you have experienced on this campus can't end with your graduation. You're warriors first, but you're also scientists, mathematicians, and so much more. Every day, you crack the code in some way. We need you to continue doing so. This should be a lesson for our enemies. Never underestimate the ingenuity of American officers. It's a competitive world out there. And we need to maintain competitive advantage over our enemies. They're trying, too. They're evolving. They're adapting. They're trying to go faster. We need to be better. And fourth, I want to discuss the importance of being a leader of character. As you prepare to leave this storied campus, you take with you the rich military tradition and history embodied in all of those who have drilled and studied here before you. Walk by the Yale Alumni War Memorial, or the memorial in Woolsey Hall, and you're reminded of what you are part of and what you will contribute to. And today, you are writing a remarkable new chapter to that history. As you accept your commission, I want you to consider the words of George Washington, who told his own officers, “Remember that it is the actions, and not the commission, that make the officer, and that there is more expected from him than his title.” These words will have greater meaning to you as your careers progress. Character is a lesson you have to constantly learn - you're never done. And it’s a lesson you will teach as well, throughout your career. We're a great nation with great responsibilities. As we meet these responsibilities, our nation stands on the foundation of character that both you and this university make stronger and stand for, and show to the rest of the world.  As you embark on your career of lives of service, know that our country is 100 percent behind you. And I am 1,000 percent behind you. I know that’s not possible, but… Everyone in this chapel knows what you've put into this, and we know what you're able to achieve. You're doing the noblest thing you can do, and I'm exceedingly proud of you. Congratulations to each of you, and to your families. Thank you all.

"Sept. 30, 2015","Thank you. Thanks, Klaus, for that warm introduction, and also for your partnership this evening, but for many years, and your leadership of the World Economic Forum. And I want to thank you and all your colleagues at the World Economic Forum for hosting and sponsoring this event. And to you, and to Secretary Pritzker, to our incoming brand new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – Joe, where are you? – General Joe Dunford, who’s here tonight, and to our many distinguished guests from across the government and the business and the technology community: ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to the Pentagon on this lovely evening. Tonight and tomorrow, we’re going to be moving the ball forward on one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense: building and rebuilding bridges between our national security endeavor here at the Pentagon, and the wonderful, innovative private-sector and technology community, which we have historically done so much together for our country and our world. Indeed, that collaboration has benefited not just our security, but our entire society – helping create in its time the Internet, GPS, and in an earlier era, satellite communications and the jet engine. That’s the main reason why I’m working so hard to strengthen our ties and renew the bonds of trust between us: because of what we can achieve together. But there’s also a more personal reason, which I’d like to share with you. It’s about how I got into this business. I was about 25, and had recently gotten – as Klaus remembered – my doctorate in theoretical physics, when I saw the Pentagon’s then-undersecretary of defense for technology – actually, it was then called research and engineering – give a speech at a physics conference about how technical thinking and technology could be applied to national security problems. Truth is, I kind of went to see it on a lark. I didn’t have that kind of aspiration, I didn’t have that kind of background. But it helped me realize that I could apply my technical knowledge and my technical skills to contribute to something bigger than myself: defending this country and making a better world for our children. That undersecretary was, of course, our honoree tonight, Bill Perry, who later became Deputy Secretary of Defense, and then Secretary of Defense, in a progression I followed, myself, some 30 years later. And in that time, Bill became a major figure in my life: a mentor, a friend, stood in for my father at my wedding, and even more – even more – he made a real difference for this country, for the world, and for people everywhere. Now, Bill was part of the World War II generation of citizen-scientists, and those who followed, who stepped forward to serve in the military and in places like Los Alamos, the MIT Radiation Laboratory, and Detroit’s legendary “arsenal of democracy” – researching, developing, and cranking out the technologies and systems that helped secure our freedom. And as a soldier in postwar Japan, then later with degrees from Stanford and a Ph.D. in mathematics, Bill understood the importance of America’s public and private sectors working toward a common goal: our nation’s security and a better world. He made it a cornerstone of his life. In his work here at the Pentagon during the Cold War, Bill embodied this commitment to partnership. When a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth, Bill channeled their work into his and Harold Brown’s groundbreaking offset strategy, harnessing technology to radically change warfare. It came to life during the 1991 Gulf War, when the world watched, stunned, at what our military might could achieve. Simply put, the offset strategy is why America’s military has been the most advanced in the world for the last 25 years. Now, I’ve seen Bill’s commitment to partnership up close, both inside and outside of the Pentagon. There was, for example, the so-called “Last Supper,” which Bill convened, and I attended as his Assistant Secretary of Defense, right here in 1993, to warn our defense industry partners about the post-Cold War drawdown. And also our work with the former Soviet states to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands, under the Nunn-Lugar program for which Bill made my office responsible. And after leaving DoD in the late 1990s, we co-founded the Preventive Defense Project, partnering Bill’s efforts at Stanford and mine at Harvard to help policymakers prevent potential national security dangers from becoming real threats. In all of this – in all of this – Bill has drawn on his extensive background in business. From his earliest days in Silicon Valley, where he started and led his own company for over a decade, to his years as managing director of the investment bank that underwrote the IPOs of Apple, Adobe, and later Amazon.com, having that private-sector perspective made Bill a better leader, a better partner, and a better strategic thinker. Now it falls to us to continue and build upon this work. Because while today we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known, that’s not a birthright. It’s not a guarantee. We live in a changing and competitive world, and we have to earn that excellence again and again. When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially DoD. Today, much more technology is commercial, and the technology base is global, while other countries have been trying to catch up with the advances that Bill helped make. Indeed, technologies once possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less capably forces, and even non-state actors. Nations like Russia and China meanwhile are modernizing their militaries to try to close the gap and erode our superiority, and at the same time our reliance on things like the Internet and satellites has lead to real vulnerabilities in space and cyberspace that our opponents are eager to exploit. So to stay ahead of those challenges and stay the best, we’re doing what Bill did – we’re investing aggressively in innovation, pushing the envelope with research into new technologies and innovative ways to apply them. We learned from Bill’s work on the offset strategy during the Cold War to develop technological and operational advantages together. And we’re applying the same approach now to develop new strategies for today’s problems. We’re also drilling what I call tunnels through that wall, that wall that sometimes separates government from scientists and commercial technologists, making that wall more permeable, so more of America’s brightest minds can contribute to our mission – even if only for a time, or on and off through their careers, as Bill and I have. And because we don’t build anything back here in the Pentagon, we’re looking and thinking outside of our five-sided box to forge new partnerships with America’s private-sector and tech communities. That’s why we’re opening our doors to all of you tonight and tomorrow. Because keeping our military on the cutting edge, and keeping our country and the world secure, demands that we listen and learn from companies like yours on issues like cybersecurity, technology innovation, and talent management. Whether you lead Google or Guggenheim Partners, Lockheed Martin or the Boston Consulting Group, we benefit from hearing from what you have to say. We’ve also opened a DoD innovation hub in Silicon Valley called the Defense Innovative Unit-Experimental, or DIUx, where I recently launched and co-funded a partnership with over 100 companies, universities, and labs across the country to propel manufacturing of flexible hybrid electronics – just one of a number of institutes of that kind that we founded. And we’re making ourselves, or trying to make ourselves, more agile, more open to working with companies outside of our traditional defense orbit – like commercial firms and start-ups. Now, on this night especially, I must add that our success in many of these endeavors requires DoD having a robust budget and long-term budget security. Thankfully we’re not up against a government shutdown tonight. We didn’t know that when we first planned this. But as I said earlier today, the short-term continuing resolution that Congress just passed isn’t good enough. It’s only a temporary solution to a much bigger problem. And a paycheck-to-paycheck approach is no better for me in defending this country than it is for you in running a business. So we need to look past this brief lull in the action and all come together behind a comprehensive, multi-year budget that funds all aspects of our national and economic security. We need a budget that will allow us to plan and build the force of the future, equipped with boldly new technology, at the forefront of frontiers like cybersecurity, and attracting and retaining the best talent for our mission – all these topics for discussion tomorrow. Because the bottom line is that whatever happens with the budget, the Pentagon still has to be a place that’s open to new ideas – where we ask, what’s the next game changer, what’s the next stealth, what’s our next offset strategy? And then we work together to chart the way ahead. That is the legacy of Bill Perry. And to honor it, and inspire future generations to carry it forward, I’ve created the new Secretary of Defense IDEAS Award.  I-D-E-A-S – now, that’s an acronym. In the Pentagon everything’s an acronym. As Bill knows, there’s (26)5 five-letter acronyms. Now, Bill, it turns out they were all already taken, except this one, so we named your award for it, the one that was left. But it works. It stands for Innovators in Defense, Enterprise, Academia and Science. And every year this award will go to someone who has built bridges between the technology world and the defense world, and who has helped drive innovation to benefit our defense mission, the security of this country and our entire world, to leave a better world for our children. Now, it’s been said – including by me – that “a good idea [and] a good speech don’t mean anything to Bill Perry.” Instead it’s always about where it’s going to lead and what the results going to be. That mentality is exactly right. An idea is just a seed. And though it may critical, what really matters to the world is what it grows into. Make no mistake, Bill Perry’s ideas grew into something special – unique for their generation. They’ve made our military stronger, our country safer, and our world more secure. And because of that, it’s my pleasure to invite him up here to present him with the inaugural Secretary of Defense IDEAS Award – Bill. And there you are, Secretary of Defense IDEAS Award, presented to the honorable Bill Perry.

"April 28, 2016","Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, thank you – thank you for those statements, and for this hearing, and for the range, both geographic and in terms of tactical, operational, and strategic, that you’re asking us to speak to.  Thanks always to the Committee for being here and for your interest in this.  And above all, Chairman, thank you for thanking the troops – means a lot – you have many opportunities to carry that to them directly, but I’ll try to do that too, when I do.  Appreciate that. I will briefly in my opening statement address all of the aspects of the subjects you raised in your two statements – obviously our campaign to defeat ISIL, but more broadly, our military strategy in the Middle East.  I appreciate that this is my seventh appearance before this committee; the fifth one focused on the Middle East since I became Secretary of Defense.  And the timing is, as Senator Reed noted, fortuitous, in this sense:  I just returned from a two-week trip to the Asia-Pacific and also the Middle East – both regions critical to U.S. and global security, and where our men and women in uniform are deeply engaged, as they are all over the world.  It’s emblematic of why, with all the challenges going on today – particularly the five challenges I discussed with you last month in my budget testimony, namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism, especially ISIL – DoD can’t choose between one or the other, or between acting in the present and investing in the future.  We have to do them all. While there’s much I could say about the Asia-Pacific, I’m obviously going to focus my comments here today on the Middle East.  There, our actions and our strong military posture continue to be guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s national interests.  These are several things; they include dealing ISIL a lasting defeat. That was the principal purpose of my visit to Iraq last week, where I conferred with our commanders and visited with our troops; met with Prime Minister Abadi and Defense Minister Ubaidi; spoke to Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani; and announced a number of key next steps that President Obama has directed to further accelerate the defeat of ISIL – more on that in a moment. When I appeared before this committee to discuss our counter-ISIL campaign in early December, I outlined how we had embarked on a major acceleration of this campaign – an effort Chairman Dunford and I had recommended to the President in October.  And it consisted of multiple steps. First, there were a number of immediate accelerants.  We deployed additional strike aircraft to Incirlik, supporting an expanded air campaign against new targets and new categories of targets illuminated by refined intelligence.  We deployed an initial contingent of special operations forces to Syria.  We expanded equipping of Syrian Arab forces engaged in the fight against ISIL.  We began enabling capable, motivated local forces in southern Syria also, and enhancing Jordan’s border control and defenses.  We leveraged air power and advisors to help the Peshmerga take Sinjar, cutting the Iraqi side of the main line of communication between ISIL’s power centers in Raqqa and Mosul.  We introduced an expeditionary targeting force.  We worked to improve our ability to target ISIL’s leadership and presence beyond Iraq and Syria.  And we started to expand the military campaign against ISIL to every domain, including cyber and space. All these capabilities were marshaled against a clear coalition military campaign plan focusing operations on three objectives:  one, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, which is necessary – not sufficient, but necessary; second, combatting the metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear, as has been noted by both the Chairman and Senator Reed; and three, our most important mission, which is to help protect the homeland. In addition to accelerating the campaign with additional U.S. capabilities, we renewed our outreach to coalition members.  And over the last three months, I’ve convened my counterparts several times – in Paris, Brussels, last week in Riyadh, next week in Europe – to brief them on the coalition military campaign plan, but above all to urge them to contribute more, and in more meaningful ways. Since we embarked on that major acceleration, results followed, and they’ve continued even in recent weeks. On the battlefield in Iraq, the Iraqi Security Forces retook Ramadi and Hit, and along with Kurdish Peshmerga have begun operations to isolate and pressure Mosul, with the intent to collapse ISIL’s control over that city.  And in Syria, capable and motivated local forces supported by our coalition retook the Tishreen Dam in the west and the town of Shaddadi in the east – cutting off two significant lines of communication into Raqqa, including one of the last major northern arteries between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq. We’ve also seen results in targeting ISIL’s leaders and finances.  We’re systematically eliminating ISIL’s “cabinet,” having taken out its so-called ministers of war and finance.  We captured one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, removed external plotters from the battlefield, and most recently took out the ISIL emir for southern Mosul, weakening ISIL’s ranks there.  And our attacks on ISIL’s economic infrastructure – from oil wells and trucks to cash storage to ISIL’s financial leaders – is putting a stranglehold on ISIL’s ability to pay its fighters, undermining its ability to govern, and making it harder to attract new recruits. These are the results – there are also results in our coalition’s train-and-equip efforts, as well.  So far, with your support in Congress, we’ve trained over 20,000 Iraqi Security Forces, and provided six full brigade sets of equipment to the Iraqi Army.  And we’ve provided two brigade sets to the Peshmerga, part of more than 12 million pounds of critical supplies donated by more than 20 countries – for our part, ranging from ammunition, to small, medium, and heavy weapons, to counter-IED equipment. Meanwhile, in addition to the local forces we’re working with in both Iraq and Syria, 90 percent of our military coalition partners – from Europe, the Gulf, and Asia; 26 countries in all – have committed in the past few months to increase their contributions to help accelerate the defeat of ISIL. All this has been necessary for putting ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat, but it’s not sufficient.  Indeed, I’ve consistently told you that we’re looking to do more, and that we would be doing more.  As we take advantage of opportunities, we’re generating new ones, and then seizing those opportunities to repeat this cycle – reinforcing success.  This has been our intent and is consistent with our overall strategic approach, which is to enable capable, motivated local forces to recapture and then hold and govern territory tyrannized by ISIL. Now, based on the results we’ve had, and our desire to continue accelerating ISIL’s lasting defeat, we are conducting the ‘next plays’ of the military campaign.  They are: one, stabilizing Iraq’s Anbar Province; two, generating Iraqi Security Forces to envelop Mosul; three, identifying and developing more local forces in Syria that will isolate and pressure Raqqa; and four, providing more firepower, sustainment, and logistical support to our partners to enable them to collapse ISIL’s control over both these cities. To help facilitate these next plays, we’re taking a number of key actions in both Iraq and Syria – actions President Obama directed and that he and I announced over the last week and a half.  And I should note that the President has approved all the actions that Chairman Dunford and I have recommended to him to date. In Iraq, our actions are in support of Iraqi Security Forces’ operations to isolate and pressure Mosul.  They’ve all been approved by Prime Minister Abadi.  As I told our troops in Baghdad last week, we’ll be placing advisors with the ISF down to the brigade and battalion level.  We’ll be leveraging Apache attack helicopters to support the ISF’s efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul.  We’ll send additional HIMARS to support the Iraqi ground offensive there.  We’ll provide financial assistance to the Peshmerga, up to $415 million, to bolster one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIL.  And, to do all this, we’re going to adjust how we use the U.S. forces already in Iraq, and immediately bring in about 215 more of them. In Syria, our actions are to help our local partners continue isolating and pressuring Raqqa.  As the President announced on Monday, we’re increasing U.S. forces there six-fold, from 50 to 300.  These additional 250 personnel, including special operations forces, will help expand our ongoing efforts to identify, train, and equip capable, motivated local anti-ISIL forces inside Syria, especially among the Sunni Arab community.  And they’ll also serve as a hub to incorporate partner special forces – from both European and Gulf partners – that will augment our coalition’s counter-ISIL efforts there. In the meantime, in addition to initiating training inside Syria, we’re also continuing to train and equip other vetted Syrian forces outside of Syria – keeping our focus, as we have in recent months, on battle-hardened, proven anti-ISIL leaders whom we can make more capable as enablers and amplifiers of our effects. And in this context, let me say that the Section 1209 program is central to our ground campaign in Syria, and we’re now carrying out a different approach than before – instead, one that we’ve used to train and enable local elements that have proven themselves against ISIL on the battlefield.  We’ve moved away from last year’s disappointments with the former approach to the program, and we need your support to fully overcome them, focus on the program as it is now, and, in particular, release the now $349 million in 1209 funding currently blocked by Congress.  And Mr. Chairman, I understand you intend to help clear these funds with the committee, and I hope the other committees will follow suit.  And I’m grateful for that. The fact is, for our commanders to be agile in accelerating our campaign against ISIL, we need a similarly agile Congressional funding process.  We’re required to submit reprogramming requests, as you all know, to the four Congressional defense committees, and so far on these funds we’ve received differing responses, on differing timelines, and sometimes with conflicting demands.  We must get this working better going forward.  I would also urge you and the other three defense committees to consider ending the reprogramming requirement for Syria, so that it’s on equal footing with how you’ve structured your oversight of our train-and-equip programs in Iraq and Afghanistan.  As it stands, the current setup involves – invites troubling micromanagement of a wartime effort, and risks inhibiting results. Beyond Iraq and Syria, we’re also addressing ISIL’s metastases.  In Afghanistan, since we authorized our forces to conduct targeted strikes against ISIL there, we’ve been able to degrade the terrorist group’s elements in that country.  And in Libya, we’ve continued to follow ISIL activities closely, undertaking a successful strike last year in which we took out ISIL’s key leader in the country, and another strike in February against an ISIL training camp.  And as the new Libyan government gets on its feet, we will support it in the fight against ISIL.  We will counter ISIL and work with partners wherever ISIL has or tries to gain a foothold, whether in Yemen, West Africa, or South or Southeast Asia. Even as we do more, we’re continuing to marshal our friends and allies across the counter-ISIL coalition to do more also to accelerate ISIL’s lasting defeat. When I met with my counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council last week, I emphasized the importance of their countries doing more – not only militarily, as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been doing, but also politically and economically.  That’s because Sunni support for stabilization, multi-sectarian governance, and reconstruction will all be critical to ensuring that ISIL stays defeated.  And Mr. Chairman, on the second, the point you made, which is, in the region in my conversations there, parties are already beginning to look beyond the defeat of ISIL and ask what their situation is at that point.  That reinforces the need, as you indicated, to think strategically.  Next week, in Stuttgart, Germany, I’ll be convening my fellow defense ministers from the major contributors to the military campaign, to discuss ways we can all continue to accelerate our efforts. That said, while the military momentum is gathering strength and ISIL is struggling to resist our multi-faceted pressure, I am increasingly concerned about political, economic, and diplomatic challenges in both Iraq and Syria affecting the pace of the military campaign. In Iraq, as the proximity of the ISIL threat against Baghdad has diminished, political ambitions have created discord, and, in some instances, ethno-sectarian competition has increased – creating an added burden and distraction for Prime Minister Abadi’s government before the task of defeating ISIL is complete.  This, of course, is occurring while Iraq struggles with significant fiscal challenges due to the lower price of oil and a huge reconstruction bill as it retakes cities from ISIL.  And in Syria, competing agendas for the future of the political transition are inhibiting the generation and coalescing of anti-ISIL forces.  Secretary Kerry, Secretary Lew, and my colleagues from the other departments and agencies are focused on this intently, but they need support from you in Congress to help ensure that military momentum is matched with political and economic momentum, and that the military defeat of ISIL in Syria and Iraq, when it is complete, will be lasting. I’ve articulated a clear strategy with the end-state being a lasting defeat of ISIL – and that means it must be achieved by local forces.  Our strategic approach is therefore to enable such forces to collapse ISIL’s control of Mosul and Raqqa, by bringing to bear in support of them the full might of the U.S. military through some of our most unique and cutting-edge capabilities – such as a precision air campaign, an expeditionary targeting force, offensive operations in cyberspace, training, logistics, sustainment, and equipment.  Enabling local forces – not substituting for them – is necessary to ensure a lasting defeat.  And sometimes that means our pace is predicated on the speed at which local forces can absorb our enabling. Now some seem to suggest we pursue different strategies.  And there are, in fact, alternative strategies, and I’ve addressed these alternatives in previous testimonies.  But we don’t recommend them, and here’s why: One alternative would be to leave the complex and chaotic Middle East, try to contain ISIL’s danger to the United States, and target terrorists entirely from off-shore.  An approach of this sort has it attractions, since it avoids the many complexities of the Middle East.  But the reality is that such a containment approach simply cannot succeed in today’s connected and globalized world, and I don’t recommend it. Another alternative would be to introduce a significant foreign ground force – hypothetically “international,” although almost certainly preponderantly American – to capture Raqqa and Mosul and other territory seized by ISIL.  But as I have testified previously, there are several problems with this approach that have led me not to recommend it either. In the near-term, such a strategic approach would entail a significant military undertaking that, much as we’d wish otherwise, realistically we would embark upon largely by ourselves.  And it would be ceding our competitive advantage of special forces, mobility, and firepower, instead fighting on the enemy’s terms of ground combat amidst a local population that has previously responded violently to such an approach. In the medium-term, by seeming to Americanize or Westernize the effort to expel ISIL from the populations of Iraq and Syria, we might turn those local people who are fighting ISIL, or who are inclined to resist their rule, into fighting us instead.  As Chairman Dunford has said, ISIL “would love nothing more than a large presence of U.S. forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria, so that they could have a call to jihad.” And lastly, in the long-term, there would still remain the problem of securing and governing the territory recaptured, which in the end must be done by local forces.  We cannot substitute for them. The bottom line is this:  We can’t ignore this fight, but we also can’t win it entirely from the outside in.  That’s why we’re helping capable, motivated local forces in every way we can, without taking their place. Finally, I want to conclude with a few words about resources, as I have serious concerns with a proposal from one of the defense committees to underfund DoD’s overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion, and spend that money on programmatic items we didn’t request.  I have to say this approach is deeply flawed, and troubling.  Having detailed my objections yesterday before the Appropriations Committee, today, in the context of this testimony, I just want to highlight the danger of underfunding our war effort and gambling with funding for our troops in places like Iraq and Syria.  As Secretary of Defense, I cannot support such a maneuver. Indeed, it’s exceedingly important that we provide our troops and commanders in the field with all the resources they need to succeed.  And I know that with your support, and with the continued dedication of our people and our partners, we will deliver ISIL a lasting defeat. Thank you.

"Sept. 2, 2014","To the men and women of the Department of Defense: Preventing military suicide is one of DoD’s highest priorities, and something I’m personally committed to as Secretary of Defense.  As we observe Suicide Prevention Month, we must rededicate ourselves to actively working not only every month, but every day to fulfill our collective responsibility to watch out for each other and take care of each other. Human beings are fragile, and suicide is a complex and devastating event that affects us all.  The painful loss of life and its heartbreaking aftermath spread beyond the individual and immediate family, taking a toll on fellow service members, friends, neighbors, coworkers, and society itself.  While preventing suicide takes all of us working together, it begins with a personal commitment. When someone is going through challenges and comes to you for help, it doesn’t make them weak.  It means they’re strong, because asking for help when you need it takes courage and strength.  What we need to remember – what our entire country needs to remember – is that these brave individuals shouldn’t be avoided or stigmatized.  They need to be embraced.  Whether you’re a service member, a veteran, a DoD civilian, or a friend or family member of someone who is, you have the power to make a difference.  It only takes one person to ask one question or make one call – and that single act can save a life. If you need help, if you know someone who is, or even if you just need someone to talk to, contact the Military Crisis Line via phone, online chat, or text message.  Just call 1-800-273-8255 and press 1; visit www.militarycrisisline.net; or text 838255.  It’s free, easy, confidential, and trained professionals are always there for you – 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The battle to prevent suicide cannot be waged on a single front.  It will only be won if we stand together and take every opportunity – in our homes, at our duty stations, and in conversations with friends and mentors – to support each other and be there for those in our communities who need our help.  By fighting as one team, we will help prevent suicide. Thank you, and your families, for all that you do for our country.

"June 22, 2015","Thank you so much, Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen.  Thank you.  More about her in just a moment. But first, Guten Morgen.  Ich freue mich sehr hier in Berlin zu sein, danke Ihnen fuer das herzliche Willkommen. I hope that makes my instructors at the Goethe Institute in Rothenburg ob der Tauber long ago, Brigitte [unclear], if you’re still around, thank you.  I hope I made you proud. I want to thank all of you for coming together today to talk about the future of the U.S.-German partnership and the Transatlantic relationship, and I’m pleased to say that future is incredibly bright. We have many people to thank for that.  Ambassador John Emerson has done a remarkable job deepening ties here.  Thank you, John.  I’d also like to thank Atlantik-Brücke, its Chairman Friedrich Merz and Executive Director Eveline Metzen for hosting us today and doing so much to support the Transatlantic relationship.  Thank you. And I, more importantly we, must thank Defense Minister von der Leyen.  I knew from our first meeting that she would be an excellent colleague and a fierce advocate for Germany’s men and women in uniform. Just as I studied in Germany, she studied in California at Stanford.  I value her remarkable candor as she pursues defense reforms and explores ways to attract more men and women to military service, two initiatives that I also focus on in America’s military.  I welcome her advocacy for an increased German leadership role, and I appreciate her willingness to challenge convention.  I can think of no better representative for Germany’s military and for Germany’s leadership in NATO and Europe. I look forward to continuing our visit today and in the days ahead and in deepening the U.S.-Germany partnership in the years ahead. We gather here during a year when history fills the air and at a moment when we have the opportunity to continue the dramatic progress this continent has made in recent decades.  For even as we face challenges in Europe’s south and Europe’s east, and also around the world, we do so with unique advantages as a community. At a time when some have suggested our relationship is suffering from a crisis and others have questioned the staying power of our partnership, we know better.  The new threats facing Europe have revealed more of our collective strengths and our collective shortcomings.  And our unity – so powerful when intact – will help assure Transatlantic security and ensure that we move forward together. And as we think about our future, we gain confidence from our shared history.  There were many symbolic ends to the Cold War.  The most obvious, and welcome and well-known happened just outside these doors when the Berlin Wall was torn down and the Brandenburg Gate reopened.  But for many, the Cold War ended on more personal terms.  For some, it was the opportunity to visit a family in East Berlin or to study abroad. For me, it was when the last nuclear weapon rolled out of Ukraine.  I was there in Pervomaysk that summer day in 1996 when sunflowers were planted where a missile silo once stood.  As someone who dedicated the early part of his career to understanding – thankfully theoretically – the technical and terrible nature of nuclear weapons, it demonstrated that the world could indeed change that day.  That despite human nature’s very real need for security, a country could choose to give up nuclear weapons. In this year of anniversaries we can look back on decades of decisions that brought us to this point.  And 70 years after the end of World War II, 60 years after the western part of a divided Germany entered NATO, and 25 years after Germany’s reunification we can see remarkable progress here in Berlin and around Europe. That progress was made possible by shared interests, shared history, shared sacrifices, and most critically, a shared commitment to democratic principles and a rules- and norms-based international order.  But it was made real by the brave choices and steps taken by individuals here in Germany, in the United States and throughout all of Europe.  Some steps were bigger, like NATO and EU enlargement; some were smaller, like restoring the Reichstag and reopening the American embassy near here.  All those choices mattered. Today we can and will make choices like that again.  One only needs to take a walk outside these doors to see the good that unity can do. The success in bustling Berlin, around Germany, and throughout Europe demonstrate the value of the choices we’ve made together since the end of World War II and the Cold War.  And while we cannot predict the future, by choosing to preserve our unity and secure the rules-based international order that got us here, we can ensure that the future remains bright and that it’s widely available to all. Europeans, like all people, deserve the right to live in peace, to be part of a healthy economy, and to decide the form of government they want for themselves. That’s why we must work together to tie our trade and economies closer.  That’s why we must continue to deepen the cultural and educational exchanges that Ursula and my youths represent and that already make our citizens smarter and better prepared for their future.  And because none of the rest, none of the rest is possible without security, we need to confront new security challenges to Europe’s south and east. To the south, terrorism and state failure have put tremendous pressures on countries in North Africa and the Middle East.  Instability has caused waves of migration, stressing law enforcement and domestic institutions throughout Europe.  And around the continent, thousands of radicalized individuals have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq, and some seek to return. ISIL poses a grave threat to Europe, the United States and our friends and allies around the world because of it steady metastasis and its evil intentions.  The United States is working with a global coalition including Germany to help extricate ISIL from its safe haven, build partner capacity and deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  I’m confident we’ll do so. To the east, Russia has used its political, economic and military power to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring countries, flouted international legal norms, and destabilized the European security order by attempting to annex Crimea and continuing to fuel further violence in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, as Russia aggressively modernizes its military capabilities and warfighting doctrine, it’s also actively seeking to undermine NATO and to erode the security and economic ties that bind us all together.  And after violating the longstanding INF Treaty, Moscow’s nuclear sabre rattling raises questions about Russia’s commitment to strategic stability and causes us…to wonder about their respect…and whether they continue to respect the profound caution…that world leaders in the nuclear age have shown over decades to the brandishing of nuclear weapons. The challenges from both the south and the east are different, but both must be addressed with equal vigor.  Both require new 21st Century approaches and both the threats – and our responses – to them will define the future of Europe’s security in the Transatlantic community for years to come. To meet these challenges and secure our bright future the United States is pleased to see this great nation choose to make important contributions to international peace and security and be poised to provide leadership and security commensurate with its economic and political weight. Twenty years since Germany offered military support to UN peacekeepers and later to the NATO mission in Bosnia, Germany has been playing an important role in some of the most difficult challenges facing the world and the Transatlantic community. Today Germany is playing a leading role in the effort to diffuse the Russia-Ukraine crisis and sending military support and observers to the OSCE mission in Ukraine. Germany continues its leadership role in Afghanistan, supplying significant forces to NATO’s Resolute Support mission. Germany’s participated in the P5+1 Talks that seek to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. And most recently, Germany is providing critical training and capabilities to the fight against ISIL in northern Iraq. These are hard challenges and Europe, the United States, and the world are safer for Germany’s leadership in them. As the Secretary of Defense I’d like to thank the German government and particularly the German Bundestag for advancing and sustaining Germany military deployments and efforts that promote our mutual security. I know there’s a vibrant debate underway on Germany’s global responsibilities, one component of which is the role of Germany’s military power.  The United States is pleased that Germany is willing to open a discussion on the constitutional parameters governing security and defense activities here.  And we’re pleased that after almost ten years a new defense White Book is being written to consider the changed strategic environment and to help set your priorities. I am committed, and the Department of Defense is prepared to support these important efforts.  The United States and Germany need to explore more concrete ways to work together. Generational bonds once made this a bit easier, but times have changed and remembrance of the past will only carry our relationships so far -- especially as memories fade.  As the world changes, issues will arise that we need to solve together such as the relationship between technology, privacy and security.  And while differences between friends are natural, we must remember that our relationship is always rooted in shared interests, shared values, and our common security. We cannot take this for granted.  The United States and Germany should continue to revitalize our relationship and find new ways to extend the bonds of friendship.  To enhance…enhance our military ties I’m pleased that together we have established a Transatlantic Capability Enhancement and Training Initiative –TACET – to further coordinate our military activities, training and exercises, thus strengthening what we’re capable of doing together. That cooperation and Germany’s willingness to step up are indispensable to Transatlantic security. But we also must assure that NATO, long the gold standard in alliances, continues to evolve to meet new types of threats and secure the bright future that can be ours. Last fall in Wales, NATO’s 28 leaders agreed to several powerful steps.  Steps that together represent one of the most significant efforts in the history of the alliance.  NATO has nearly doubled the number of military exercises in just one year; set up new command centers; reorganized the NATO Response Force; and established the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, or VJTF.  Later today Defense Minister von der Leyen and I will…travel to Münster and visit with that VJTF brigade led this year by Germany and fresh from an exercise that demonstrated its ability to deploy on 48 hours’ notice from multiple locations in Europe to any crisis on NATO territory.  We’ll be joined by the Defense Ministers of Norway, and the Netherlands -- other significant contributors to the VJTF. The VJTF is only one way NATO is adapting.  To be prepared for the threats of the future we must review our plans and approaches and be ready to change the way we think about these new challenges.  How do we confront cyber attacks, propaganda campaigns, and hybrid warfare?  How do we balance liberty and security in preparing for migration surges, terrorism, and flows of foreign fighters?  How do we ensure we can deal with more than one challenge at a time? The answer, of course, is that we will do so together as we always have, but the Cold War play book doesn’t apply to this future. Our new play book takes the lessons of history and leverages our Alliance’s strengths in new ways for these new threats.  We will use small footprint, high impact rotational presence; build partner capacity; integrate planning between cyber, space and conventional forces; ensure combined military and civilian responses together; use smart sanctions; and launch new media information efforts. I will see some of what we’re doing to make that new play book a reality this week.  I already mentioned our trip to the VJTF in Münster this afternoon.  But I’ll also be traveling on to Tallinn, Estonia to visit the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence there, and the Sailors and Marines aboard the USS San Antonio who just participated in the multinational Baltic operations, or BALTOPS exercise there.  And later this week at the NATO Defense Ministerial I’ll work with my colleagues to be bold and creative as we seek new ways to adapt our alliance for these 21st Century challenges. To implement new plans and the new play book NATO has to be more capable and able, if necessary, to meet two or more challenges at once.  Or as we Americans say, NATO needs to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.  We do not have the luxury of addressing challenges one at a time.  Despite the progress since the Wales summit, the challenges and opportunities before us require that the Alliance do more.  No country can retrench and escape responsibility for confronting the threats that face us all. Throughout NATO’s history the United States has provided the lion’s share of funding for the Alliance.  Today we provide 70 percent of all defense spending in the Alliance.  And make no mistake, America remains capable of and committed to leveraging all the elements of our national power to assure our collective security, but the United States cannot, should not, and will not meet these challenges in Europe alone.  The Transatlantic relationship and Transatlantic security is, as ever, a two-sided affair. As allies, we must all ensure the Defense Investment Pledge made at last year’s Wales Summit means something.  As allies, we must all accept our fair share of security responsibility to each other; and as allies we all must choose to invest in, develop, and field new capabilities now and in the future.  Germany is stepping up on this score.  Your recent commitment to a six percent defense spending increase puts you on a positive trajectory, but more is required to ensure that Germany’s defense investments match Germany’s leadership role. That example is important because there’s an undeniable tendency to turn inward here, around Europe, and also in America.  We need to guard against that temptation, to move forward together.  We need to explain to those who doubt the value of our NATO commitments that the security of Europe is vital to everything else we hold dear. Transatlantic economic prosperity is intimately tied to the security of our nations, this continent, and the world.  Our political freedoms, so hard-won over the decades, cannot be taken for granted.  NATO and Europe have long stood for a set of principles that make us the envy of most of the world.  And NATO and Europe have long been engaged and capable of standing up for those principles here and around the world.  The world needs Europe…needs Europe…to continue to do so. A more active Germany and a more adaptive NATO will ensure that while Vladimir Putin may be intent on turning the clock back in Russia, he cannot turn the clock back in Europe. Since Russia began its campaign against Ukraine early last year -- violating the UN Charter, the Helsinki Accords, and the NATO-Russia Founding Act, as well as the commitment it made in Budapest – the Budapest Memorandum – that I myself saw signed in Budapest in 1994.  Since then the United States, NATO, and the EU have made clear to Russia that its aggressive actions have no place in today’s world. The best tool we have to confront Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is the economic sanctions regime the United States and Europe are leading against those responsible for this unacceptable behavior.  These sanctions are having an effect, and they’ve increased the cost Russia is paying for its aggression. Chancellor Merkel with her exhaustive personal diplomacy, has been a tremendous leader in this effort and I encourage the EU to maintain solidarity and support for these sanctions as they did last week, as long as it takes to convince the Kremlin to fully implement the Minsk Agreements. Ukraine is only one part of our larger concerns these days about Russia.  In response, we’re taking a strong but balanced strategic approach.  An approach that seeks to ensure Russia cannot force anyone to turn…toward the past, all the while welcoming and encouraging Russia to turn back toward the future. In our response, we will not rely on the Cold War play book. We will take a new, strong, and balanced strategic approach.  We will take necessary steps in the U.S. and NATO capabilities, posture, and plans to deter Russia’s maligned and destabilizing influence, coercion, and aggression, including its efforts to undermine strategic stability and challenge the military balance in Europe.  To do so we’ll leverage strong and modern U.S. forces -- the greatest fighting force, the world has even known – an adaptive and agile NATO working, as I said, from a new play book; and deepening security partnerships throughout Europe and around the world.  Just this week, just this week there are 20 named exercises of U.S. forces in Europe.  Just this week. We will continue to help reduce the vulnerability of allies and partners, not only through military training and support, but also through work to enhance European energy security, and therefore decrease dependence on Russian energy. Even as we take prudent steps to guard against a more aggressive Russia we will continue to cooperate with Russia when it is willing and where it is applying its influence on the many issues where Russia’s leaders do indeed see that their interests align with the interests of the international community.  This includes the P5+1 negotiations with Iran, nonproliferation more generally, counter-terrorism -- countering ISIL-like movements, and other issues. Finally, and this is important, the United States will continue to hold out the possibility that Russia will assume the role of respected partner moving forward, not isolated and going backward as it is today. Let me focus on that last point for a moment.  Much of the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, we accomplished with Russia.  Let me repeat that.  Not in spite of Russia, not against Russia, not without Russia, but with it. Russia has worked toward the future before.  In 1995, for example, I worked with the Russian Minister of Defense to ensure that it joined NATO in bringing peace to Bosnia.  In 1996 that same Minister was there planting sunflowers in Pervomaysk with his American and Ukrainian counterparts.  And more recently, Russia has hosted a key NATO supply route into Afghanistan. People in the United States, here in Europe, and it should be clear in Russia, all benefited from that collaboration and progress.  That’s why we’ll keep the door open for Russia.  But it’s up to the Kremlin to decide. We do not seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy.  But make no mistake, we will defend our allies, the rules-based international order, and the positive future it affords us.  We will stand up to Russia’s actions and their attempts to reestablish a Soviet-era sphere of influence. The United States will not let Russia drag us back to the past.  We want to move forward together. But whatever is decided in the Kremlin, we will move forward, and Europe will move forward.  That’s why we will continue America’s strength and leadership.  That’s why we encourage Germany’s efforts to lead on security.  And that’s why we’re working so hard to assure NATO’s capabilities and unity.  That’s why we still, despite past history and today’s deeply troubling trends, hold open the possibility of a turn to the future by Russia. And moving forward…moving forward will be better still.  I look forward to coming back to Europe years from now for anniversaries to come at NATO’s 100th Anniversary that celebrates the adaptive Alliance’s singular role in this new century.  For the 50th Anniversary of a unified Germany that commemorates this nation’s increased global security leadership.  For the 25th Anniversary of the VJTF that helps NATO respond to new threats.  At each of these anniversaries we hope Russia is present and contributing to global peace and prosperity. That’s the future that can be ours when we move forward together.  And if we meet our commitments to each other and stay unified, I’m confident we will reach it. Vielen Dank für ihre Aufmerksamkeit.  Ich beantworte sehr gerne ihre Fragen.  Thank you.

"Aug. 28, 2015","Hey everybody. Great to be here. Thank you all. Thanks everybody for coming – please – thank you, all of you. Congresswoman Eshoo, thank you, old friend and colleague; Congresswoman Lofgren; Congressman Honda; Mayor Liccardo; ladies and gentlemen: thank you. Thank you once again, all of you, for joining us today, and for your leadership here in the Bay Area, and for being part of this moment, which is a moment in technology history. It’s great for me to be back in Silicon Valley. When I came here in April – after spending much of last year out here – I found that I was the first Secretary of Defense to visit in almost 20 years. So I’m pleased to return again just four months after that and show the progress we’ve made in rebuilding the bridges between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley. This is one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense – renewing the ties, the bonds of trust between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon, and our wonderful, innovative, open technology community of companies and universities that make up one of America’s great strengths. We’ve had a long history of partnership that’s benefitted the entire society. This building, proof of it. The world’s largest wind tunnel, it’s tested not only B-1 bombers and F/A-18 fighters, but also Boeing’s commercial fleet, and the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, DC-10 – helping our military aviators dominate the skies, while also helping American companies dominate the global air travel and transport industry. Over most of the last 75 years, the bonds between the technology community and defense were particularly close. I’ve observed that, from seeing it from both sides: a technologist myself, and also serving many years in the Defense Department. We have today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. We need it – we need it to protect our country and to build a better world for our children. We are the best, first of all – first of all – because of the magnificent young men and women who make up that force. I was with them yesterday at Pendleton; the day before at Nellis Air Force Base – it’s them. It’s them, first and foremost, that make it the greatest. But secondly, and importantly, our strength comes from the long-standing link between the high-tech community and the government – whether it was the integrated circuit, or the Internet itself, or in an era before that the jet engine itself, satellite communications, and so on. Because we have different missions and somewhat different perspectives, sometimes we disagree, see things differently. That’s okay. I think that’s okay. Addressing disagreements through partnership is better than not speaking at all. And whether we’re developing a new product, or a new policy, the lesson to me is always the same: it’s vigorous debate and exchange that creates breakthrough ideas. So I’m here to engage and I want to deepen that exchange between us. And the fact is, that over successes and strains, our ties have endured. And I believe that the challenges and opportunities we face in this still young century demand that we strengthen our partnership in ways that benefit us both. We live in a dangerous world, and the fact that our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known is not a birthright. It’s not a guarantee. We have to earn it again and again. When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and a lot of that was sponsored by the government, particularly by the Defense Department. Today, much more of our technology is commercial, and the technology base is global. And other countries have been trying to catch up to the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. Indeed, technologies once long possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors. Meanwhile, nations like Russia and China are modernizing their forces to try to close the technology gap. And our reliance on things like satellites and the Internet can lead to real vulnerabilities in space and cyberspace that our adversaries are eager to exploit. So here’s what we’re doing to stay ahead of those challenges and to stay the best. We’re investing aggressively in innovation. We’re pushing the envelope with research into new technologies – on robotics, data science, cybersecurity, biotech, hypersonic engines that can fly over five times the speed of sound, and I could go on. We’re drilling tunnels through that wall that sometimes seems to separate government from scientists and commercial technologists – making it more permeable so more of America’s brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time. And we’re developing new partnerships with America’s private sector and tech communities, particularly here in Silicon Valley. One of the keys to this place, to Silicon Valley, is colocation, which I see every time I visit and which I experienced firsthand when I was living and working here just last year. Everyone’s in the same area, which not only helps forge relationships, but also helps spread new ideas. And that close geographic proximity, coupled with strong links between academia and industry, has made this entire region a nexus for creativity – an innovation ecosystem. Our government has historically been part of this, too, with DoD and government investments helping spur ground-up innovation in Silicon Valley – funding research that, for example, grew into things like GPS, or more recently Google’s self-driving cars, Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, and on and on. Now, obviously none of this diminishes the genius, the hard work, the tremendous effort by the innovators themselves, in San Jose, Cupertino, Mountain View, here, or for that matter Cambridge, Massachusetts, and America’s other great hubs of innovation. The government helped ignite the spark, but these were the places that nurtured the flames that created incredible applications. Given what we’ve already done, there’s truly no limit to what we can achieve together. And that’s why I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box, and invest in innovation here in Silicon Valley and in tech communities across the country. And today, now, here, we’re taking another step forward. I’m announcing that the Department of Defense is partnering with FlexTech Alliance – a consortium of 96 companies, 41 universities, 14 state and local government organizations, and 11 labs and non-profits – to establish a new manufacturing innovation institute focused on flexible hybrid electronics. This is an emerging technology that takes advanced flexible materials for circuits, communications, sensors, and power, and combines them with thinned silicon chips to ultimately produce the next generation of electronic products. The Defense Department is making a $75 million-dollar investment, which has already been matched and actually exceeded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions from our public- and private-sector partners, represented here. And like the six other Manufacturing Innovation Institutes established by President Obama over the last three years – four of which DoD helped lead, in areas like 3D printing, lightweight metals, integrated photonics, and digital manufacturing and design – this one will ensure that pioneering innovations needed to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these cutting-edge electronics will happen right here in America. I’ve talked to the President personally about these institutes on a number of occasions – he takes a personal interest in them, you might be interested to know – and I know how important it is to him that America keeps leading in manufacturing innovation and continues to bring great manufacturing jobs back home. With over 30 of the partner organizations having a presence between San Jose and the Golden Gate Bridge – including companies along the alphabet from Apple to Lockheed Martin to Xerox – the institute will be headquartered here in Silicon Valley. And it will also leverage leading and emerging innovation ecosystems across the country – places like Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and northeast Ohio. Flexible hybrid electronics have enormous potential for our defense mission. For example, our industry partners will be able to shape electronics to things, after decades of having to do it the other way around. By seamlessly printing lightweight, flexible structural integrity sensors right onto the surfaces of ships and aircraft, for example, or folding them into cracks and crevices where rigid circuit boards and bulky wiring could never fit, we’ll be able to have real-time damage reports – making the stuff of science fiction, in that sense, into reality. Our troops will be able to lighten their loads with sensors and electronic gear embedded in their clothing, and wounded warriors will benefit from smart prosthetics that have the full flexibility of human skin. The reality is, though, that as I stand here in front of you today, we don’t know all the applications this new technology will make possible – that’s the remarkable thing about innovation – and that’s another reason why America, and America’s military, must get there first. The commercial applications will be just as transformative, if not more so, given the impact of wearables, Internet-of-Things, and so on. Smart bandages that can analyze a patient’s biomarkers in their sweat will help doctors catch infections earlier. Stretchable sensors can be put on cars, bridges, and buildings to help keep people safe. Flexible medical diagnostics for x-rays and breast cancer tests will be more accurate and less painful. And instead of tracking athletic performance with bulky devices on our wrists, flexible electronics coupled with new, revolutionary fibers and textiles will let us embed washable, wearable, featherweight sensors in our clothes – giving us an even clearer picture of our health and fitness. This new partnership is only the latest of what we’re doing to rebuild the bridge between the Pentagon and the technology community. After this, I’m going across the street – right here – to host the first corporate roundtable at the headquarters of what I think of as my new start-up, the Defense Innovative Unit Experimental, or DIUx, which I announced at Stanford University in April and now is open for business. Located here at Moffett Field, its proximity to the Valley will be key to its success in helping start-ups and other companies here partner with us. And later today I’ll visit LinkedIn, to discuss and learn how DoD can better compete for talented Americans who want to contribute to our mission – because as I said, it’s not just about the best technology. We need the best people, too. This is an exciting time – it reminds me of the kind of collaboration between companies, universities, and government that built the Internet and GPS, or in an earlier era, as I said, communications satellites and the jet engine. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And that’s also true for those interested in technology. The intersection of the two is an opportunity-rich environment. These issues matter. They have to do with our protection and our security, and creating a world in which our fellow citizens can live their lives and dream their dreams and hug their children and give them a better future. Helping defend your country and making a better world is one of the noblest things a person can do. And we’re grateful to all of you for doing that with us. Thank you.

"Sept. 20, 2017"," SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JIM MATTIS:  Thank you.  Thanks very much.  Secretary Peters, old friend.  Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Wilson, General Goldfein, I'm really honored to be here.  Thank you for inviting me to this great get together of our greatest Air Force in the world. I would just tell you 70 years, you got to be proud of who are and what you've developed as a reputation.  I came here this morning, I want to pay my respects, share some thoughts about -- from my perspective, what's going on for our Departments of Defense and Air Force. And hopefully close the gap a little bit and make certain that we prime the pump for the Q&A, which is always the best part of this.  But I kind of flunked retirement.  I was out West having a good time and the primary motivator to come back is the opportunity to serve alongside such selfless, highly capable, high spirited patriots such as you, and everyone in this room understands what an honor it is for me to be back here, humbling honor, back here among you all serving alongside you. You look around this room, the integrity and the dedication to service that we just take almost for granted from one another.  We look at one another, we know where we're at, we may not have ever met each other before and yet we do know each other when we walk into this sort of an assembly here. The excellence that's here, the dedication to service, you look back and you think what General Hap Arnold would be thinking about if he was sitting right here on this stage looking out over this room today and the deep sense of satisfaction that General Arnold would have as you mark your 70th anniversary. Since your founding, I believe that American air superiority that was built on your reputation in World War II has held firm all these years.  And you're the ones who, in your formative years, you flew against Ploesti, you patrolled Megalia -- in Korea, you flew over Vietnam, we can go on. You refused to abandon Berlin, you've fought it out so many times, you're in the skies, today, over Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan.  And I would just tell you, we're going right on into the future with the U.S. Air Force where it belongs, overhead. That's a reality that we have got to marry and we've got to ensure that this comes forward into the brave new world that we see developing around us.  Americans are very proud, they're very grateful for your service.  Everywhere I go, you won't believe the kudos I get.  And so often, it's even with specific mention of what airman, soldiers, sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen are doing. And they're very proud for your devotion to this experiment in democracy.  That's all America is.  It's one great big experiment that depends on each generation of Americans, having enough young people like you, and you're all young compared to me, and Secretary Peters, but I would just say, having enough young people -- thought I'd slide that in. But I also want to thank all the veterans here today.  Those of you who once wore the uniform, you've got my color hair in many cases, today.  But I would say that we hope always -- and those of us who are on active duty in the civilian or military ranks today, we hope to live up to your legacy. I can remember going into many fights, and I would've been more afraid of letting down the veterans, than I would've been the enemy's cunning or capability, that we really don't want to let down those of you who went before and set such a high, high bar of sacrifice and of capability, and of commitment to accomplishing any mission. Let me talk for a few minutes this morning about what I expect of the Air Force, so there will be no surprises, so we know one another.   I do expect that you can fight well, and you will win. It's that simple.  I'd expand on it to some degree, but I can't.  I'll simply dive deeper into the details of what I'm looking at.  But I would say that America's ground and other forces have long operated with the confidence that no evil could come down upon them from above.  And I can speak with some personal background on this, I remember after 9/11 that I went to see a man after a Navy fleet commander had directed me to go into Afghanistan.  So I went to see a man I'll be forever proud to say I served under, a man named Buzz Moseley, who is down in Prince Sultan airbase where the CAOC was located. Arriving there very late at night, never met him before.  I laid out -- for a Marine, this was kind of high tech.  I had a PowerPoint slide that showed some water with a little ship painted on it.  Then it showed a (crossed arrow ?) going into Afghanistan, and it had a little statue -- it had a big X in Afghanistan.  And I slid it across the table to him, there about midnight, at Prince Sultan, at his headquarters, and he took his fingers -- after looking at it, and put them on the scale of miles, and he marched them from the ship into the middle of Afghanistan. Then he pushed the map back across the table, and said, ""Are you really going to do this?"", and I said, ""Yeah.  Taking about 1000 of my best friends up there, and we're going to fight.""  And he looked at it and he said, ""Well if you get in trouble, I'll turn every airplane in the sky over your head.""  And ladies and gentlemen, as a result of that, for the first time in 30 years, in my assault waves going in, 350 nautical miles, refueled by KC-130s halfway there in the helicopters, we did not take artillery in our assault wave. That's how much confidence I had as he explained how he was going to take care of us, he was going to move the two Marine liaison officers off the CAOC floor, and right up next to the one star, over watching it. And I give you this as an example, because one of the real strengths of the U.S. military today, probably the source of most of our strength, is the jointness, is the ability to put together different capabilities, and come up with a synergy that it far exceeds the two plus two, or whatever the arithmetic equation would make you think we would be at.  Because with protectors of the high-ground, you unleash enormous capabilities on the low-ground, down there where the terrestrial creatures are, that I spent a fair amount of time with. It's good to remind ourselves as we sit here today that Americans have no God-given right to victory on the battlefield.  And among a crew like this, I know that doesn't take a lot of detailed explanation. You recognize the capability, the commitment, the loyalty, the courage, the cunning, all have to come together with training, and recruiting the right people and rewarding the right behavior if we're going to maintain the ability to fight and win, because we never want to come in second. We've seen that before, when America was not ready.  We saw it in North Africa at the beginning of World War II, we saw it in Korea at the beginning of that war, and we do not ever want to be caught in that position.  We need the Air Force to make clear to our adversaries, make very clear to our adversaries, it is much better for them to deal with Secretary Tillerson in the State Department, they don't want to deal, in combat, with the U.S. Department of Defense.  So all that you do in our Air Force -- (Applause.) Thank you.  And all that you do in our Air Force is a reminder that America's got two fundamental sources of power.  One of those is the power of inspiration.  And the other is the power of intimidation.  And you represent, rightly, the power of intimidation, even though you are often the best ambassadors, the most reassuring ambassadors to allies, and friends who are trying to keep the peace.  And as we go forward into this world, it's important that our diplomats always speak from a position of absolute strength when it comes to the military of America's awesome determination to defend herself from those who would deny us our freedom or our liberty. And whether it be safe guarding our Nuclear deterrent, or air combat, mobility to space, to personnel management processes and policies and everything in between, your actions must meet one standard.  And that is to make the U.S. Air Force more lethal every day that you serve; to turn the U.S. Air Force over to your successors as more lethal than you inherited it here today. I am absolutely confident -- I have total confidence that Dr. Wilson, our Secretary of Air Force, to General Goldfein old comrade in arms, a cunning war fighter in every sense of the world, who I have served alongside.  I have absolute confidence with the right leaders to take this Air Force forward, to make it more lethal, more respected, more capable everywhere in the world. They will be examining every policy, every practice, every element of our team, every bit of equipment and our culture to ensure that we're all aligned on making the Air Force the most lethal Air Force in the world.  We're going to have to actively encourage the initiative and aggressiveness that I see in the young airmen just walking in the hallways here.  Out there at the very furthest edges of the Air Force enterprise, so their ideas, their initiative is being harnessed and brought forward. On the DOD level, I would just tell you we are pursuing three lines of effort.  And the first one, no surprise to you, is building a more lethal joint force, and it's absolutely essential that the Air Force be in the front rank in that effort.  But we're also working on a second line of effort to strengthen international alliances and partnerships. If I were to give you a mental model for this ladies and gentlemen, it goes back to the greatest generation coming home from World War II, having grown up in economic depression, having been through a war that killed tens of millions, 50, 60, 70 million, with unbelievable heartbreak, and they come home and they say what a crummy world.  And we're part of it whether we like it or not, so lets put together the alliances and the partnerships that will make it a better world for our children.  And based on that, they began to put together a -- an alliance world for America, whether it be the NATO alliance or partnerships with other nations, because we recognized that it was absolutely critical to do so. Furthermore, the third line of effort is to reform the business practices of the departments inside -- the military departments -- inside DOD, and especially, the Department of Defense itself.  And Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan is working full time, 24/7 on that -- and I mean 24/7.  No matter how early I come to work, he's there ahead of time.  No matter what time I leave on Sunday, he's still there, working on this.  And we're going to make it a more effective use of the people's treasury when we get the money, and we're going to turn it into lethality against our enemies' designs. Let me start with the lethality and the readiness issue.  Churchill pointed out that wars don't always come when you're ready, and he had some background in this, as you'll remember how the Royal Air Force had to buy time for Britain to hold on until they could amass the strength, and get the alliance with the United States and everything else to turn the tide in that very desperate battle, early battles, of World War II. I want to repeat here that we have no God-given right to victory on the battlefield.  And in that regard, make no mistake that our adversaries are right now making concentrated efforts to erode our competitive edge.  You know it, I know it.  We can see it in the world around us.  And I would say, too, that by contesting our supremacy in every domain, we can see it working against us in aggregate. And I want to get into more about this, because some nations that are challenging our dominance in the air are doing so through a proliferation of advanced, integrated air defense network, plus fifth generation aircraft.  And I think, too, if you look at outer space, which was long considered a sanctuary of sorts, it's now contested. And then you add another domain, the cyberspace domain, at the same time, and that's now contested at the operating -- in an operating realm at the tactical, the operational, and the strategic levels of conflict.  And that means that we took several thousand years of war on land and sea, and it took us about 100 years to get another domain, air, brought to the position we're in today.  And then, in the last 10 years, we've seen basically two new domains mature into war-fighting realms on us.  Never in history has this happened in our past. So our air, naval, ground, and logistics bases today are also under threat of precision, all-weather, day/night guided munition bombardment, which will complicate our operations, and make passive and active base defense absolutely critical in the future.  So if we fail to adapt, ladies and gentlemen, at the speed of relevance, then our forces, military forces, our air force, will lose the very technical and tactical advantage that we've enjoyed since World War II. The joint effort of rebuilding our readiness and lethality is based on the following problem statement for the U.S. Military, because every military in history that has successfully adapted -- transformed, modernized, whatever word you want to use -- has done so based on setting out to solve a specific military problem. I believe the problem we face today is how do we maintain a nuclear deterrent and a decisive conventional force, while maintaining irregular warfare as a core competency?  Because the paradox of war is, the adversary will always move against your perceived weakness.  So a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent is there to ensure a war that can never be won, is never fought. And I've been out to Bangor, Washington to see the submarine force; MINOT to see the B-52s and the missiles, and all, and I am absolutely convinced that having this safe, secure, and effective deterrent is critical -- the most critical piece of our nation's defense. When I talk about a decisive conventional force, people say, ""Well, that's awfully expensive.""  It is, but it's a heck of a lot less expensive than having to fight a conventional war because some adversary thought they could take us on and win.  And so, I believe that we have got to be able to either deter that, or to win as swiftly as possible, if we must go into a conflict.  I talk about retaining irregular warfare as a core competency, because we need it to safeguard America.  What we do not want, ladies and gentlemen, is to be dominant, and at the same time, irrelevant to our nation's defense. And for those of us who were on active duty on 9/11, you know exactly what I'm referring to as we look back on that tragic day, when some maniacs thought by hurting us, they could scare us.  Well, the U.S. Air Force doesn't scare, and you were immediately launched into the fight and you were ready, and that's our obligation to the next generation of airmen.  That we would be just as ready when the nation calls. In the face of these challenges that we see around the world, and recognizing this problem statement, I would also say, that despite the casualties, the loss of our wonderful, beautiful, young troops, thousands of them over these last 16 odd years of combat, nothing has done more damage to the readiness of our armed forces than the continuing resolutions that stop us from taking initiative, than the lack of budgetary predictability, which means our industries will not change what they are doing, because they don't know whether they are going to be able to get the funding the next year to keep an effort going.  And you can't ask companies to take survivor risk without some kind of reassurance. I bring this up because if we don't get budgetary predictability, if we don't remove the defense caps, then we're questioning whether or not America has the ability to survive.  It's that simple.  And I think that right now, we have got to -- right now, move with the Congress, and the Congressional leaders are calling for this, toward a budget -- passing the president's budget, toward lifting and removing the defense caps, in the current increasingly severe security situation, so that we maintain our competitive edge. Otherwise, it will erode.  If Congress restores managerial integrity over the budget, this will enable us to invest in the critical warfighting capabilities, including in space, and cyberspace, where we need new starts, in order to take advantage of what our industry can deliver, if we are willing to invest there.  And I think, too, we have to look at how we conduct in the future, global strike, close air support, global intelligence, global mobility, global surveillance, global command and control. And that includes looking beyond pure technological means on command and control, as we look toward the initiative on airmen who might see their headquarters cut off from them and they've got to act anyway in defense of our country.  Because in cyberspace, there's more and more -- I would call it, attack capability, in the hands of enemy to take down our commanding control systems than we have seen in a past time. So that's what we're talking about when we talk about lethality and what I believe needs to be done.  Our second line of effort is the strengthening of alliances and partner building, new partnerships.  And I just remind everybody here that few of us -- in my case, never, did I fight in an all American formation. I've always fought alongside coalition partners.  And it's not easy, as Churchill put it, the only thing tougher than fighting with allies is fighting without them.  Because we're all different.  And we understand that.  And we're all built from our formative experiences as young NCOs, as young officers, and we have a certain way of doing business. And we have to recognize, at times, that that can actually get in the way of building alliances when it's on the military side.  Why do I emphasize it?  Because history is compelling on this point, that nations with allies thrive and those without allies decline.  It's that simple. I can go through, all the way back, thousands of years and keep pointing out that you will stagnate and wither if you do not have allies at your side.  So to our allies and any partners here in this room, I would just say, thank you for standing with us.  In Iraq today, we have allies.  In Afghanistan, 39 nations stand together. In the defeat ISIS campaign, there are 69 nations and four international organizations, including the Arab League, NATO, Interpol and the European Union that are together helping on the defeat ISIS campaign. But ultimately, it comes down to America to breathe confidence and capability into these alliances so that they feel like they can actually have the success that the world's leader can help breed in all of their forces.  And I think this is absolutely critical and we have to recognize that our organizations, our processes and procedures, have got to be allied friendly. They've got to be welcoming.  And the point I would make to the American officers in the room is that we must be willing to do more than to listen to our allies.  We must be willing to be persuaded by them.  And there's a whale of a difference between listening to somebody else's different idea and then going right on about the way you were going to do it and being willing to be persuaded. And remember, not all the good ideas come from the nation with the most aircraft carriers.  The third line of effort goes to the heart of our competitive edge.  And that is reforming the department and its business processes and gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense. And we must do this, ladies and gentlemen.  We have got to be very, very careful about where we spend and what we do with the money and make certain that what we're doing is making the department more lethal.  That's what our countrymen and -women expect of us.  And we do not want to lose the confidence of the Congress, the confidence of the American people that, in fact, we are gaining full value. And that's the only way we're going to win and sustain the trust of the American people.  Reforming the department is going to take the acquisition enterprise being reformed, and we're looking at how we break that out between software and hardware to take advantage of software development. Do we really need to have the same procedures when we're doing a small program as when we're doing a major aircraft program?  All these things are being looked at and I've got some great people coming in to help, from Deputy Secretary Shanahan, to Undersecretary Ellen Lord. These are people that know what they're doing, there's nothing new under the sun, other than the opportunities and the challenges that they then apply a very rigorous and discipline problem solving effort to.  So we'll be moving very, very aggressively on this.  It's going to require delegating decision authority, in many cases, to the outer edges of the enterprises, to unleash the great ideas we find among our bright and committed airmen. It's also important to integrate this across the joint force, because the real strength we've exhibited over 16 years of war is jointness -- its integrating the capabilities together.  And I was just talking to chief of staff of the Air Force, as we're standing here in front of the room, talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission.  I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.  No service doing anything that reveals the other service being in a weaker position.  We're out to make each other stronger to gain that synergy. Also, I don't want the same policies in every service.  I want different cultures to be reflected in your policies. This is actually a strength to the Department of Defense that we have different service cultures, so long as there is a spirit of collaboration that operates over all of them.  And nothing could have been more obvious to me as a young one star, to walk into three star Buzz Moseley's office and have him say he was going to put every airplane over my head during those critical hours when we'd be landing a few hundred people, close to thousands of enemy. And at that point, I knew it was over for the enemy.  I was not concerned when my troops closed in on them, what would be the outcome.  The skill, the ferocity, the ethics of our troops, of my young marines and sailors, I knew what would happen.  My concern was the broader issue, and General Moseley took that issue right off the table, that we would not be in apposition of operational checkmate thanks to the airmen and the skies overhead. That was jointness at the leading edge of a battlefield, and it continued on as C-17s coming out of Germany were landing on dirt airstrips in the middle of nowhere and offer rolling light armored vehicles that were going to complicate the enemy's day.  There was absolutely nothing they could do.  I did not care how many -- how many miles they could run, I didn't care what weapon they had, they were going to lose; it was that simple.  And it was all because we could come together as a joint team and the enemy was going to face cascading problems as they tried to confront us. Before we go to the best part of this, which is going to be the Q&A, I just want to talk about the human element, and that's, of course, focused right on leadership.  And it's fundamentally about people.  The ability to build trust in every chain of command and the ability to create harmony across the joint force is really what we're looking for in our leaders. It may be a vicious harmony as we close in on the enemy, but we have got to rebuild harmony across the force and that includes with or allies and our Department of State allies as well, over there across the river from the Pentagon. We need people who are willing to speak truth to power, to bring reality to bear. And that can appear tough at times, because once in a while, we don't -- we don't hire wilting violets in the U.S. military.  We reward -- we definitely reward initiative and aggressiveness.  We've got to be open to those mavericks, to those people who think differently, because we don't want to be surprised on the battlefield because we ignored the mavericks inside our own ranks. There is a great American writer, Flannery O'Connor, and she wrote, ""Truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it emotionally.""  A very interesting point, so you've got to remain open to those uncomfortable truths, as some people call them, as we craft an air force fit -- an air force fit for its future time and future battles. I began my remarks by mentioning how American air power has remained dominant for 70 years now and the world watches and asks, can we keep it?  I think there's no room for complacency, I will tell you that I have seen no complacency in the Air Force on this and I think some of you know me well enough to know that if I'd seen it, I would tell you right here this morning.  I've not seen complacency; I've seen aggressive embracing of the new threats, of looking for solutions because you must hold the line. You have got to hold the line and allow this country to come back together to allow this country to regain its fundamental friendliness toward one another and to every Airman and civilian serving today, I ask that you protect the high ground, you be ready to fight and to win.  You're the airmen who went through everything to get to Ploesti, you're the airmen who've got a great legacy.  You may be the youngest the service, but you have a very proud legacy already that the veterans who went before you lived up to.  And remember this, there is nothing we will ask of you that the Airmen who went before you did not overcome. So keep confidence in yourselves, keep confidence in your leadership and let's go to Q&A and see what's on your mind here. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. (Applause.) MODERATOR:  We have had a number of questions about the Middle East.  I think they can be summed up in what does winning look like in the Middle East and how do we get there? SEC. MATTIS:  Well, all wars are local and when we talked about winning in the Middle East, the Middle East is not the Middle East; there's one kind of fight going on in Iraq where we're invited in by the government, that's recognized by the United Nations, where we're fighting alongside the Iraqi military. There's an altogether different fight going on, although it may look the same to an Airman overhead, but a very different fight in Syria where the Syrians had lost credibility -- their government and they had -- they did not control large swathes of the country and to defeat ISIS we have gone in there.  That's a different sort of fight.  So, it -- basically what we're going to do there, we are going to crush ISIS.  There are those who questioned if we had the right capabilities there in the field. The bottom line, when the administration came in, the direction was to change it in two ways.  One, to accelerate the fight and to move more swiftly against the enemy's sources of power.  We knew their external operations people were conducting fights going into Europe, you saw them in Brussels and Paris, you saw them in Turkey and those kind of places so we had to get in and take that out.  We have accelerated the fight. The second change is both in Iraq and Syria due to the danger of foreign fighters returning home, we're trying to reduce that number.  I got this loud and clear when Secretary Tillerson had the 70-odd nations and international partners in -- organizations into Foggy Bottom here, back in -- I think it was March, and so we changed our tactics to take the time to encircle the places where they had strength and circle them. And instead of fighting attrition fights where we keep pushing them away, we encircle them and fight battles of annihilation so that the foreign fighters can't get out. So that's how it looks there.  ISIS goes down and we work with the government in Baghdad in order to make certain Iraq does not find itself with ISIS 2.0 coming back.  With Syria, you'll see it move toward Geneva, and an international conference will move out of where the Russians are meeting with them occasionally these days, Astana, and we'll move it into Geneva and work toward gaining some kind of stability there in the geo-political heart of the Middle East. In Afghanistan, on the other hand, we're going to reinforce, we're going to realign ourselves to mostly train, advise, assist.  We'll see more Air Force mentoring of their Air Force, so eventually we'll replace ourselves there in the skies over Afghanistan with the right kind of Air Force fit for the kind of battles we're fighting. And we will, by mentoring, we will get enough of the JTACs on the ground, that NATO Air Forces can come in and support those folks who are fighting there.  Something we have not been able to do in the past because we didn't have enough advisers. And we will eventually drive this down to a point, as our goal, that victory would like the people and the government of Afghanistan can handle this threat, from the terrorists, using their own security forces with international mentors, probably there for many years to come. But the fighting will be done by the Afghans with our advising train, advise assist mentoring, and for right now, air support, certainly supported by NATO.  So each area, victory looks differently but the bottom line is we're going to make it so that the world is not subject to the kind of terror attacks we saw recently in Barcelona -- a place like this. It can be long term, it's going to have an educational component, it's got a lot of things going on in the Middle East as far as reducing the lure of this sort of terrorism, this sort of murder that we see going on.  But in each area we're trying to construct local solutions, working by, with and through allies. Sometimes, that will be supporting, for example, the brilliantly led French campaign in the Sahel where airmen are providing surveillance support, refueling support, this sort of thing.  We've got some forces on the ground but the French are maintaining upwards of 4,000 troops.  We probably have around 20,000 African troops, and there in the Lake Chad, north of the Lake Chad basin, you see that kind of a fight going -- again, by with and through allies which is why that second line of effort is so important. MODERATOR:  This is a question I'm sure you didn't anticipate.  What's your take on North Korea and what can we do about it? SEC. MATTIS:  Well, obviously, North Korea has been a problem, it goes back to the days we worked together, you recall, under Dr. Perry and Senator Cohen -- our secretary of defense in those days -- the international community is aligned on this.  How many times have you seen China, Russia, France, the United States, I can go on, United Kingdom, all voting in a unified position in the U.N. Security Council.  That gives you an idea of the degree of international concern and the alignment of the international interests to stop the provocations, to stop the nuclear program there in -- in North Korea. It is still a diplomatically led effort, it is one that is fully supported by the Department of Defense, in terms of the ensuring that the military options exist.  And for right now, you see it as a primary effort up at the United Nations General Assembly meetings that are going on this week in New York. We continue to press on the diplomatic level and that includes economic sanctions, of course.  But at this time, we must also recognize the somber reality that military options must be available in order to protect our allies and ourselves. MODERATOR:  Perhaps a somewhat easier question, what's your take on the current state of jointness?  And if it's not good, what do we need to do to improve jointness? SEC. MATTIS:  You know, one of the challenges we faced, ladies and gentlemen, is when we solve problems, we can sometimes forget that there was a problem we solved, and as we move forward, we leave the lessons behind. I think the most important thing on jointness is that we make certain that young officers, probably in their mid-careers, have sufficient time in joint staffs, that they learn how they bring their capability, and I want no misunderstanding. I want young NCOs and young officers sharpening their core competency in each of their services, that by midgrades, NCOs and officers, they need to have exposure and involvement in a joint way to ensure that put together, on any battlefield swiftly, what is needed in that specific war in order to win. My concern would be if we forgot the lessons that we have taken so long to learn.  I don't believe it will happen in this generation of airmen, soldiers, sailors, marines, I don't believe it will happen because we have spent so much time operating together that now it's kind of ingrained in you. It's part of our formative experience.  But if coming out of these wars, we do not maintain joint integrated exercises, then we could lose that very lesson.  Right now, that's not happening.  It's very clear, as I talk to soldiers, how much they know they depend on air support. It's very clear when you talk to sailors, they know what they need to do to support the troops on the ground, I can go on.  So I think right now we're in pretty good shape on jointness, but we do not want to lose the lessons learned the hard way. And militaries have lost those lessons, many times in history, and the result has usually been a pretty traumatic event, the opening of the next fight.  We also have to learn now, where can we adapt to the new realities and make certain that we're carrying jointness into those realities. We're not thinking that this is all about one service.  Again, it's got to be a spirit of collaboration that permeates the entire joint force where we're always looking for how to improve another force's ability to create defeats for the enemy. As a young infantry second lieutenant, looking at a map considering a problem many years ago -- in the last millennium, that's how long ago it was. (Laughter.) I've never forget in those days we had F-4s -- an F-4 pilot in my infantry battalion, because we're assigned at that level, tapping me on the shoulder and say, ""Watch this, Lieutenant.  You're not going to have that problem when you get there."" So it's good to have your mind opened by people who bring their capabilities to bear and aggressively look for opportunities to solve each other's problem.  And that's what I'm counting on the U.S. Air Force for. MODERATOR:  I think -- you know, this conference has a lot of industry folks here as well.  And I think there's become a general feeling that kind of collaboration, which we're trying to get in the joint world, doesn't also extend to industry.  Industry needs a more collaborative environment that they don't feel they get enough sense of where you want them to go.  And yet they are willing to invest money to try to help you go there. So, think the question is, you know, do you have any thoughts about how you could engage industry better than it is currently being engaged? SEC. MATTIS:  Yes, it was interesting when I came into the job, I met with a bunch of folks in industry.  First of all, I became aware that some people thought, ""Well. you can't really do that.""  And I said, ""Why not?  They're Americans, aren't they?  You know, last time I checked, they were on our side,"" and so -- (Applause.) And sure enough, you know you can find the smart lawyers -- and there are some, believe it or not. (Laughter.) And they came in and said, ""Well, of course you can meet with them, you just can't meet with one and show favorites,"" which I understand.  In our job, you know, we can't do that. But what struck me when I met with the industry leaders was how they had very good relations with certain elements of the Department of Defense and others had no relationship.  And when I dove more deeply into it, I found the very thing that I'd run into initially, which was some of the services had gotten to the point of paralysis, because they felt they -- they could not speak to members of industry, representatives of industry, because somehow it was illegal. I mean, there are right ways to do this, where you never violate our ethical rules.  There's a reason why our industries are trusted.  But at the same time we must maintain the trust of the American people that we're not doing some subtle modifications to the fair practices of our acquisition efforts. And so, I think that the most important thing is that we open the lines of communication in a way that consider industry, American industry and allied industry where it's appropriate, as partners in this effort. And I think the most important thing is to get the communication going again, if it -- in the areas where it's languished. Now, there's some areas where it's very healthy, and -- from R&D efforts and everything else, there's a lot of back and forth, a lot of sharing, and a lot of exploration that's very, very valuable. So it's a mixed bag right now.  In some areas, I like the way it's working.  But I want to encourage all of you within -- strictly within the ethical regulations, do not have imaginary legal restrictions on your leadership responsibility to find the best bang for the buck, to find the most far-reaching innovations that are out there. I lived for three years, after I got out of the Marines, in Silicon Valley, right on Sand Hill road.  And nothing is more reminding of just how innovative America is than to live in the middle of Silicon Valley and see the way that they're changing the world we live in. And so, want you all engaged in this and to make certain that the lines of communication are open in a way that we can aggressively and swiftly take advantage of the opportunities that we see developing around us in the private sector. MODERATOR:  So now I have, probably, a most important question I've been asked up here.  I have lots of these.  Do you really have a nickname of Mad Dog?  And if so, how did you get it? (Laughter.) SEC. MATTIS:  Trust Secretary Peters to ask that one. (Laughter.) Ladies and gentlemen, it was never my call sign.  Even my troops laughed at it when they read it in the newspaper.  It was a slow news day, I think, and somebody made it up.  (Laughter.) I was always known by my call sign, Chaos. (Laughter.) But I must confess how I got that name, because some people thought, well, it's probably because, you know, the great Chinese classical warfare strategist, Sun Tzu… you copied him or something like that.  I'd love to tell you it was for a dignified reason like that. In fact, when I was a regimental commander of 7,500 Sailors and Marines out in the Mojave Desert, there was nothing to do but go blow up the desert.  I always had good ideas; at least, I thought they were very good ideas.  And one day, walking out of my Operations Officers office, I noticed ""chaos"" written on this whiteboard.  I said, ""Wait -- what's this about?""  Curious, you know.  We all are.  He said, ""Oh, you don't need to know that.""  Of course, right away, you know, up goes the old -- (Laughter.) So what's it about?  And finally he kind of said, ""Well, it means the colonel has an outstanding solution."" (Laughter.) And it was very much tongue in cheek, ladies and gentlemen.  They didn't consider all my solutions quite as outstanding as I enthusiastically promoted them.  But I like what my irreverent troops had used there, so I adopted it as my call sign. So, there was never a Mad Dog in there, other than some press person who needed a little bit of a fantasy life fulfilled, I think. (Laughter.) Thanks very much, Secretary.  Thanks, everybody. (Applause.) -END-  ","Air Force Association 2017 Air, Space and Cyber Conference",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1318960/air-force-association-2017-air-space-and-cyber-conference/
"May 6, 2015","Mr. Chairman, thank you; Vice Chairman Durbin, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today. And Mr. Chairman, I want to especially recognize the sense of civility and courtesy with which you conduct all you do, including the leadership of this Committee. It doesn’t go unnoticed, least of all by me, and is much appreciated. And Vice Chairman, I will make sure that we get to the issues you raised – both in our private conversation and just now – in the course of this, and thank you for your leadership. And thank you all for thanking my friend and shipmate, Marty Dempsey, for his wonderful service. I’m gonna miss him. I know all of you on this committee share the same devotion that I do to the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and to the great – the defense of our great country. And I hope that my tenure as Secretary of Defense will be marked by partnership with you on their behalf. I am gratified that this committee, as well as the three other defense committees, recognize the urgent need to halt the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act. President Obama and I deeply share in that recognition. And indeed, I want to commend you and your colleagues for both recognizing, and saying, that sequestration threatens our military’s readiness, the size of our warfighting forces, the presence and capabilities of our air and naval fleets, our future technological security, and ultimately, the lives of our men and women in uniform. The Joint Chiefs have said the same – and they have specified the kinds of cuts that their services would have to make if sequester returns. Over the past three fiscal years, the Defense Department has taken over three quarters of a trillion dollars in cuts to its future years defense spending. The magnitude of these cuts would stress the most capable planners and programmers. But the stresses have been made even greater because of the frequently sudden and unpredictable timing and nature of the cuts – as well as continued uncertainty over sequestration. And as a result, DoD has been forced to make a series of incremental, inefficient decisions – often made well into a fiscal year after prolonged continuing resolutions are finally resolved. Moreover, even as budgets have dropped precipitously, our forces have been responding to unexpectedly high demand from a tumultuous world. As a result, I believe our defense program is now unbalanced. We’ve been forced to prioritize force structure and readiness over modernization – taking on risks in capabilities and infrastructure that are far too great. This is a serious problem. High demands on smaller force structure mean the equipment and capabilities of too many components of the military are growing too old, too fast – from our nuclear deterrent to our tactical forces. Meanwhile, in each of the past several years, painful but necessary reforms proposed by DoD – including many significant reforms like eliminating overhead and unneeded infrastructure, retiring older force structure, and making reasonable adjustments in compensation – have been denied by Congress at the same time that sequestration looms. And we are starting to see this double whammy once again in markups of legislation this year. If confronted with sequestration-level budgets and continued obstacles to reform, I do not believe that we can simply keep making incremental cuts. As I’ve said before, we would have to change the shape, and not just the size, of our military – significantly affecting parts of our defense strategy. In recent weeks, some in Congress have tried to provide DoD with its full budget request for Fiscal Year 2016 by transferring funds from the base budget into our accounts for Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, meant to fund the incremental, temporary costs of overseas conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. While this approach clearly recognizes that the budget total we’ve requested is needed, the avenue it takes is just as clearly a road to nowhere. I say this because President Obama has already made clear that he won’t accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward – as this approach does – and he won’t accept a budget that severs the link between our national security and our economic security. Legislation that implements this budget framework will therefore be subject to veto. So if we don’t come together and find a different path by fall, when a budget’s needed, it will put our department and our troops in an all too familiar and very difficult position. We will yet again have to make very hasty and drastic decisions to adjust to the failure to have an adequate DoD budget – decisions that none of us wants to make. The Joint Chiefs and I are concerned that if our Congressional committees continue to advance this idea and don’t explore alternatives, then we’ll be left holding the bag. That’s not where I want to be in six months, but since OCO – the OCO funding approach is not the kind of widely-shared budget agreement that is needed, we can see now that it won’t succeed. Moreover, the one-year OCO approach does nothing to reduce the deficit. It risks undermining support for a mechanism, OCO, which is meant, as I said, to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. Most importantly, because it doesn’t provide a stable, multi-year budget horizon, this one-year approach is managerially unsound, and also unfairly dispiriting to our force. Our military personnel and their families deserve to know their future more than just one year at a time. And not just them. Our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans – not end-of-year crises or short-term fixes – if they are to be efficient and cutting-edge as we need them to be. Last, and fundamentally, as a nation we need to base our defense budgeting on our long-term military strategy, and that’s not a one-year project. This funding approach also reflects a narrow way of looking at our national security – one that ignores the vital contributions made by State Department, Justice Department, Treasury Department, Homeland Security Department, and disregards the enduring long-term connection between our nation’s security and many other factors: factors like scientific R&D; to keep our technological edge, education of a future all-volunteer military force, and the general economic strength of our country. Finally, I’m also concerned that how we deal with the budget is being watched by the rest of the world – by our friends and potential foes alike. It could give a misleadingly diminished picture of America’s great strength and resolve. For all these reasons, we need a better solution than the one now being considered. Two years ago we saw members of Congress come together and reach a two-year agreement through the Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act. Although we preferred a longer-term solution to sequestration, that deal was able to provide DoD a measure of stability needed to plan for more than just one year. Today, I hope we can come together for a longer-term, multi-year agreement that provides the budget stability we need by locking in defense and non-defense budget levels consistent with the President’s request. I pledge my personal support to this effort, as well as the support of the entire staff of the Department of Defense, and I would like to work with each of you, as well as other leaders and members of Congress, to this end. If we’re successful, I’m confident we can build a force of the future that’s powerful enough to underwrite our strategy and to show resolve to friends and potential foes alike. A force that’s equipped with bold new technology and ideas, able to lead in cutting-edge capabilities in cyber and space. A force that’s lean and efficient throughout the enterprise; that continues to attract and inspire new generations of Americans to contribute to this great mission. That’s the vision for the force of the future I’ve been pursuing since I took office 11 weeks ago, and I hope to continue doing so, in partnership with all of you. Mr. Chairman, this is a time for coming together and problem-solving, which we’ve come to know well from members of this committee. Much like in December 2013, our only choice is to come together to find a real solution that reflects our strength and security as a nation. I look to this committee, and the many leaders who sit on it, to help us get on the right path out of this wilderness. Thank you.

"Nov. 13, 2014","Chairman, obviously your last hearing is not going unnoticed and unrecognized. So we shall proceed. As I was saying, I very much appreciate, and I know General Dempsey does, the opportunity to come back after a couple of months and update this committee on what we’re doing and how we’re doing it, why we’re doing it. I know that this has not been, as you all know, the only communication we have had with this committee. We have had many, many briefings with your staff. Many of you I have spoken to directly, as well as General Dempsey and many of our military leaders. So to have this opportunity to bring together and some convergence of explanation of what we’re doing and why and how I very much appreciate. Mr. Chairman, your leadership and your service to this committee, to this Congress, to this country over many years has been recognized many times appropriately over the last few months. It will continue to be recognized. It should be recognized. I want to thank you personally for your support, your friendship. I have valued that over the last two years I’ve had the privilege of holding this job. I will miss you personally and I know this committee will. But there are so many very able and capable and dedicated people that are right next to you that will carry on. So I didn’t want this opportunity to go without me expressing my thanks and best wishes to you and to your family and to the next chapter in your life and your many new adventures that lie ahead. As I noted, I’m joined this morning by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, who, I, too, have – like you have appreciated his wise council and his partnership as we have dealt with some of the most complex and difficult issues that I think this country has faced in a long time. And I know General Dempsey appreciates all of your service as well. General Dempsey has played a critical role over the last six months, especially in shaping and developing our strategy along with our CENTCOM commander, who you all know, General Lloyd Austin. To General Austin and his commanders and to our men and women, I want to thank them. Mr. Chairman, President Obama, Chairman Dempsey, General Austin, all of our leaders and I have been very clear that our campaign against ISIL will be long and will be difficult. We are three months into a multiyear effort. As we enter a new phase of this effort, working to train and equip more counter ISIL forces in both Iraq and Syria, we will succeed only with the strong support of Congress and the strong support of this committee. Since I testified before this committee two months ago, our campaign against ISIL has made progress. ISIL’s advance in parts of Iraq has stalled and in some cases been reversed by Iraqi, Kurdish and tribal forces supported by U.S. and coalition airstrikes. But ISIL continues to represent a serious threat to American interests, our allies in the Middle East.  And will still influence over a broad swath of territory in Western and Northern Iraq and Eastern Syria. But as President Obama has said, ISIL will not be defeated through military force alone. Our comprehensive strategy is focused on supporting inclusive governance, sustaining a broad-based regional and global coalition and strengthening local forces on the ground.  It also includes undercutting ISIL’s flow of resources, countering ISIL’s messaging, constricting the flow of foreign fighters, providing humanitarian assistance and our intensive regional and global diplomatic effort. In Iraq, much more needs to be done to achieve political reform. But we are seeing steps in the right direction. In the wake of years of polarizing leadership, Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi is leaning forward by engaging all of Iraqi’s diverse communities.  He’s appointed a Sunni defense minister after that post was left vacant for more than four years. And he’s moving to create a Iraqi National Guard which would empower local forces, especially in Sunni tribal areas of Anbar Province while aligning them with the central government. And you may have noticed that yesterday it was announced that he replaced 36 of his most senior commanders, integrating the Iraqi Security Forces with more senior Sunni leaders. This is essential to strengthening not only the Iraqi Security Forces but strengthening a central government, a government in Iraq that, in fact, can build trust and confidence of the Iraqi people. Thanks to intensive diplomacy, America is not supporting this effort alone. We have built a global coalition to support local forces in both Iraq and Syria, a coalition of over 60 nations that are contributing assistance ranging from air support to training to humanitarian assistance. Since I testified here, 16 nations have joined the military campaign against ISIL. The first coalition airstrikes in Syria involved Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a tremendous demonstration of unity among our Middle East Arab partners. Coalition partners have carried out 130 airstrikes against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria. Last week, Canada launched its first airstrikes in Iraq, bringing the total to 12 nations participating in strike operations in Iraq and Syria, as additional partners provide tanker command and control and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. Coalition nations have also pledged hundreds of personnel to support our mission to train, advise, assist and help build the capacity of Iraqi forces. Our global coalition is also helping shape the burden of the campaign with nearly all our coalition partners funding their own contributions. With the President’s Special Envoy for our counter ISIL coalition General John Allen. General Allen is in the lead as he coordinates the coalition strategy and contributions across all our lines of effort with our coalition partners. As a coalition and as a nation, we must prepare for a long and difficult struggle. There will be setbacks, but we are seeing steady and sustainable progress. And, Mr. Chairman, I think that’s an important part of answering the questions we have, the questions we have about our own strategy that we ask ourselves, the questions you have about our strategy. Can we sustain it? Can be it be sustained after at some point we leave? That is a critical component of our strategy, asking that question and answering that question. We’re seeing steady and sustainable progress along DOD’s two main lines of effort. First, we’re seeing progress in degrading and destroying ISIL’s warfighting capacity and in denying safe haven to its fighters. Directly and through support of Iraqi forces, coalition airstrikes have hit ISIL’s command and control, its leadership, its revenue sources, its supply lines and logistics and impaired its ability to mass forces.  In recent weeks, these strikes helped Peshmerga forces push ISIL out of Zumar in northern Iraq and helped Iraqi Security Forces begin retaking areas around the major oil refinery at Baiji. Last weekend, airstrikes hit a gathering of ISIL battlefield commanders near Mosul. ISIL fighters have been forced to alter their tactics. We knew they would. They will adapt. They will adjust, maneuvering in smaller groups, sometimes making it more difficult to identify targets, hiding large equipment and changing their communications methods. Sustaining this pressure on ISIL will help provide time and space, time and space for Iraq to reconstitute its forces and continue going on the offense.  This pressure is having an effect on potential ISIL recruits and collaborators, striking a blow to morale and recruitment. We know that. Our intelligence is very clear on that.  And as Iraqi forces build strength, the tempo and intensity of our coalition’s air campaign will accelerate in tandem. We need to continue to help build partner capacity so that local forces can take the fight to ISIL and ultimately defeat it. Today, many of the approximately 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq are engaged in advise-and-assist programs with Iraqi and Kurdish forces. As you know, last week the Defense Department announced that we will expand the support to Iraqi forces by deploying up to 1,500 additional military personnel including two new advise-and-assist centers at locations beyond Baghdad and Irbil, as well as four new training centers in northern, western and central Iraq.  I recommended this deployment to the President based on the request of the government of Iraq, U.S. Central Command’s assessment of Iraqi units, General Dempsey’s recommendation and the strength of the Iraqi and coalition’s campaign plan. These additional troops and facilities will help strengthen and reconstitute Iraqi forces, expanding the geography of our mission but not the mission itself. U.S. military personnel will not be engaged in a ground combat mission. Our phased plan to help strengthen Iraqi Security Forces has three major components. First, our advise-and-assist mission that is partnering coalition advisers with Iraqi forces at the headquarters level. U.S. and coalition advisers are already helping plan current and future operations. And, as noted, we will expand this mission with two new advise-and-assist centers that we have announced. Second, we will support the regeneration of Iraqi forces so that they are better equipped to launch offensive operations over the coming year. CENTCOM’s new training sites in northern, western and central Iraq will help train 12 Iraqi brigades. And more than a dozen coalition nations have expressed their intent to send trainers and advisers to help build the capacity of Iraqi forces. Third, we will concentrate on broader security sector reform to help transform Iraqi forces into a more coherent and capable unified force. This includes Prime Minister Abadi’s initiative to develop provincially based National Guard units, which I mentioned earlier. Coalition partners are playing an important role in all these efforts by providing advisers and trainers to help regenerate Iraqi combat brigades. Together we are also providing more arms and equipment to Iraqi Security Forces. This year the United States alone has shipped more than $685 million in critical equipment and supplies to Iraq, ranging from grenades and small arms to tank ammunition, helicopter rockets and Hellfire missiles, hundreds of which will be arriving this month.  U.S. and coalition partners together have delivered over 2.7 million pounds of supplies, including 33 million rounds of ammunition to Peshmerga forces alone. Mr. Chairman, in Syria our actions against ISIL are focused on shaping the dynamic in Iraq which remains the priority of our counter ISIL strategy. But we are sober about the challenges we face as ISIL exploits the complicated long-running Syrian conflict. Because we do not have a partner government to work with in Syria or regular military partners to work with, as we do in Iraq, in the near term, our military aims in Syria are limited to isolating and destroying ISIL’s safe havens. Coalition air strikes in Syria are accomplishing this by containing -- or continuing to target significant ISIL assets, which has impaired ISIL’s ability to move fighters and equipment into Iraq, disrupted their command and control, damaged their training bases, and significantly limited their financial revenue by hitting captured oil fields and disrupting their crude oil distribution and collection sites. The Defense Department’s longer term effort is to train and equip credible, moderate Syrian opposition forces, especially from areas most threatened by ISIL.  This will require at least eight to 12 months to begin making a difference on the ground.  We know the opposition will continue to face intense pressure in a multifront battle space. And we are considering options for how U.S. and coalition forces can further support these forces once they are trained and equipped. These forces are being trained in units, not as individuals. Our strategy in Syria will demand time, patience, perseverance to deliver results. We cannot accomplish our objectives in Syria all at once. The position of the United States remains that Asad has lost the legitimacy to govern, that there is no purely military solution to the conflict in Syria.  Alongside our efforts to isolate and sanction the Asad regime, our strategy is to strengthen the moderate opposition to the point where they – where they can first defend and control their local areas. Next, go on the offense and take back areas that have been lost to ISIL. And, ultimately, as their capability and leverage develop, to create conditions for a political settlement in Syria. Thanks to the broad bipartisan support in Congress, Mr. Chairman, including majorities in both parties, preparations for our Syria train-and-equip mission are now complete.  We’ve established a combined joint interagency task force to coordinate the coalition’s train-and-equip program for Syria. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other partner nations have agreed to host training sites. Development of those sites, recruiting and vetting will begin when Congress has authorized the actual funding. But we are still moving forward, doing what we must do to prepare for that vetting process and that training. We are still at the front end of our campaign against ISIL. As President Obama told leaders of both houses of Congress last week during a session, which I attended with General Austin. Congressional support, your support, is vital for the campaign to succeed. As you all know the administration is requesting $5.6 billion in additional Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal year 2015 to help execute our comprehensive strategy in Iraq and Syria. $5 billion of it for the Department of Defense. $3.4 billion would support ongoing U.S. military actions against ISIL under Operation Inherent Resolve. $1.6 billion would go toward a new Iraqi train-and-equip fund devoted to helping reconstitute Iraq’s security forces. This fund will be critical for enabling Iraqi Security Forces, including Kurdish and tribal forces, to go on the offense in 2015. And it will require the Iraqi government and coalition members to make significant contributions as well.  Over 60 % [sic], or $1 billion, of the $1.6 billion fund would be available initially. The remaining $600 million would not be released until the government of Iraq and coalition partners have provided at least $600 million of their own contributions, because the Iraqi government must invest in its own security and its own future. As the President said last week, the administration will be engaging the Congress to support the effort against ISIL by enacting a new and specific Authorization for the Use of Military Force, one that reflects the scope and the challenges of our campaign against ISIL. DoD will work closely with the Congress on each component of this effort. As this mission continues to progress, we will continue to evaluate and reevaluate each element of our strategy. Having just marked Veterans Day earlier this week, let me again thank this committee for what you do every day to support all our men and women in uniform and their families serving this country across the world. Mr. Chairman, thank you. ",Statement on the Administration's Strategy and Military Campaign Against ISIL Before the House Armed Services Committee,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606632/statement-on-the-administrations-strategy-and-military-campaign-against-isil-be/
"Dec. 12, 2016","Thank you, thank you. And what a beautiful, beautiful song. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Good evening, everyone. President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; Minister Lieberman, my friend; General Eizenkot; General Eshel; ladies and gentlemen:  it’s a pleasure to be back in Israel, and to join all of you here at Nevatim for this historic ceremony. This evening, we’re celebrating the remarkable progress of the U.S.-Israel defense relationship, and also of an air force that began by flying leftover World War II planes and is now flying the most advanced aircraft in history. These F-35 stealth fighters are the first of 50 aircraft that will help build the future of the Israeli Air Force, and that’s thanks to a historic Memorandum of Understanding we signed this year in which the U.S. pledged an unprecedented $38 billion in security assistance over the next decade. And as of today, Israel is our first and only friend in the region that’s flying the F-35.  And it’s my honor to be here marking the delivery of these planes, the Adir, to America’s closest friend and ally in the region. During my time as Secretary of Defense, I’ve traveled across this nation – from the northern border under threat from Hezbollah, to Nevatim here in the south today.  And during these visits, I’ve seen firsthand some of threats you face daily from many different directions. That’s one of the many reasons why the United States is committed to providing Israel with the most advanced military capabilities critical, not only to ensure Israel can defend itself but also to maintain its qualitative military edge.  And of course, there’s no better symbol of the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security than the F-35, the most capable aircraft in the skies. I’m told that in Hebrew, Adir means “mighty one” – which is an apt name for aircraft that represent the full force of military might.  From its stealth technology to its fighter capabilities, the F-35 will allow pilots to evade detection and fly at supersonic speeds while conducting air defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and ground attack missions.  It also features advanced sensors and data collection capabilities that allow it to share data with other aircraft.  These information-sharing features, in particular, make it an ideal aircraft for joint and coalition operations, which will help the U.S. and Israel air forces operate more jointly – and more effectively – than ever before.  Together, we will dominate the skies. As we celebrate Israel’s new F-35s this evening, it’s worth noting how important Israeli companies – as well as U.S. companies – were to the creation of this state-of-the-art aircraft.  From wing production to the helmet-mounted display to fuselage components, Israel’s innovative technologies have helped define this aircraft and its capabilities.  That’s one example, of many, that shows how our partnership benefits the security of both of our nations. While the F-35 is an important symbol of the America’s commitment to Israel’s qualitative military edge, it’s only the most recent example of how our security cooperation continues to soar to new heights. We’re maintaining robust military assistance and funding critical missile defense systems like the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow, to name a few.  We’ve also expanded our cooperation into new domains – including space and cyberspace in the last few years – to prepare for 21st century threats.  And we’ll continue to provide Israel with the most advanced capabilities – including more F-35 Adirs – to further sharpen its qualitative military edge. As we gather here today, the U.S.-Israel defense relationship is stronger than it’s ever been, and America’s pledge to defend Israel’s security remains unwavering. Indeed, with the current turmoil in the region, we’re more committed to Israel’s security today than ever before.  And from World War II surplus at the dawn of the Israeli state to stealth fighters today, the United States will continue to stand by its ally and friend Israel – as we have from the very beginning – as we have from the very beginning and will continue to do so long into the future. Thank you. ",Remarks at F-35I Arrival Ceremony,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1027936/remarks-at-f-35i-arrival-ceremony/
"Nov. 11, 2014","Thank you all very much. Jake [Tapper], thank you. Thank you for your talent and your time today. I want to recognize an individual who has already been recognized this afternoon, Jan Scruggs… and appropriately recognized as the individual who wasn’t maybe solely responsible for this memorial being built, but single-handedly did as much as any one individual, with a pretty spectacular team, many are here today to support him. To Jan Scruggs, and the board that stepped forward at a time that was difficult, when a lot of people didn’t believe that they could do it, nor the reason as to why they were recognizing the warriors, not the war but the Vietnam veterans. So to Jan Scruggs and many of his original board members who are here today, and others who have stepped in and followed the leadership of Jan and that original board, cast of characters back in 1979, we want to recognize them again today – especially on this 30th anniversary of the Statue of the Three Soldiers. So to Jan – I know you’re in New York; I just talked to him a week ago – and to many of your board members here, the current board members, those who continue to support this effort – and one other thing, the effort to build an educational center, which is not complete yet. It will be. Your continued support to help that get accomplished, that connects this in ways that few memorials do. So thank all of you who’ve continued to work on that effort. We have a few miles to go, but it is a worthy and noble effort. So thank you all very much. To all the veterans here today, thank you. To your families, thank you. To the veterans who are not here today, and their families, we also want to acknowledge your service and your sacrifices. And to those who have not worn our nation’s uniform, thank you. Thank you for supporting these men and women, these veterans. Thank you for serving in a special capacity. Thank you for supporting our men and women today in uniform, and their families, who are all over the world – doing incredible work on behalf the security of this country – a world that is dangerous, complicated, interconnected, and it is requiring skill sets of our military and these men and women that we’ve never had to have before. So for your support, for our country’s support of these men and women doing this incredible job for all of us, thank you. Forty-five years ago today, I attended my first Veterans Day ceremony as a veteran. I was a student at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. I had returned from Vietnam with my brother Tom a few months before that. I’ve always remembered that Veterans Day in 1969, because it reminded me of the one constant throughout the Vietnam War – the one constant that many of you out here today recall from that war. And that constant was the uncommon valor of Americans – the uncommon valor of Americans from every corner of this country. They were the quiet heroes, the quiet heroes of our time. Some of these veterans are here today… and the names of many more are memorialized on the Wall behind us. This Wall means many things to many people. As it records the names of the past, and reflects on our hopes for the future, it also offers a reminder – a message that carries across generations: The Wall reminds us to honor those who defend our country… from making sure they’re treated with the dignity and the respect and the appreciation they deserve, to caring for those who return home with visible – and invisible – wounds of war. Regardless of when or where or what war they served in, taking care of our people is a sacred responsibility that we must always honor. The Wall reminds us to be honest in our telling of history. There is nothing to be gained by glossing over the darker portions of a war, the Vietnam War, that bitterly divided America. We must openly acknowledge past mistakes, and we must learn from past mistakes, because that is how we avoid repeating past mistakes. The Wall reminds us that we must never take the security of our country for granted, ever. And we must always question our policies that send our citizens to war, because our nation’s policies must always be worthy – worthy of the sacrifices we ask of the men and women who defend our country. Every month I have a private lunch with junior enlisted personnel from all the services. What they tell me – and what every American should know – is that today’s servicemembers don’t want to be glorified or given special treatment or given special privileges. The entire 9/11 generation volunteered to serve at a time of war – at a time our nation was threatened, was attacked – and they have a strong desire to continue making a difference in the world… whether by staying in the military, finding a job that engages them every day outside the military, pursuing another outlet for public service, or just being involved in their local communities. They don’t need a hand-out or a hand-up – they just want the opportunity to continue proving themselves. It falls on us to make sure that they get that opportunity… the opportunity that too many veterans have been denied in the past. So on Veterans Day, and every day, let’s celebrate our troops, our veterans, their families by telling their stories – stories that inspire us all, generation after generation after generation – so that others can understand what these men and women have done for our country. Let’s help those who need it, while supporting their strength and their resilience. And let’s honor our veterans by creating new opportunities – new opportunities for them to contribute after their service in uniform, so they can continue to help make a better world. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve always been grateful for an opportunity to share this day, on this location, at this memorial, with veterans and their families. It is a high privilege. Thank you.

"Sept. 1, 2015","Well, good morning and thank you. Thank you very much, National Commander Helm.  I want to thank the leadership of this great organization for inviting me, and each and every one of you here for your tireless advocacy on behalf of our veterans and our men and women in uniform.  And I want to thank Baltimore for hosting this year’s convention. I don’t know whether Bob McDonald is here, but I also want to thank him for his determined leadership at the V.A. and his partnership. From the Second Battle of the Marne, to the Battle of the Bulge, from Inchon to Khe Sanh, from Fallujah to Wanat, to every person here who proudly called themselves a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine – who now proudly call themselves a Legionnaire – thank you.  You are defending those who defend us. There’s someone else here today, a great personal friend and distinguished predecessor, who I want to mention and thank – Chuck Hagel. Chuck was a soldier in Vietnam, stories of his bravery are well known.  And throughout the rest of his life in public service, Chuck dedicated himself to those who served…and that’s why he proudly wears the golden seal. Vietnam taught us the hard way, that while one may question why we fight, we must never question the honor of the men and women who do the fighting.  Our Vietnam vets were not given the recognition or respect they deserved.  We cannot reverse that wrong, but we can learn from it, and that’s what we’re trying to do together.   Never forgetting the sacrifices America’s bravest sons and daughters make is what drives, inspires, and gives meaning to this organization. For nearly 100 years, Legionnaires like you have fought for freedoms nobly earned by our country’s finest patriots. You’re driven by an enduring truth: that above all – above all – the strength of our military, and our nation, are our dedicated men and women in uniform.  And given that truth, we have a responsibility to defend those who’ve defended us. That’s why as Secretary of Defense, among the three principal commitments I made when first took this office a few months ago, first and foremost is my commitment to our people, to the current force – including active duty, guard, reservists and their families, and  veterans too. Second, is my commitment to lead with a national security strategy suited for this new century – protecting our country, keeping us strong, respected by our friends, feared by our enemies, and always ready. And third, is my commitment to our future and to the force of the future – where innovation and technology remain pillars of American strength, and making sure tomorrow’s force is as great as today’s by continuing to recruit and retain the best America has to offer. Because above all else, our people are what make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Few others know better than you: our great responsibility is to make sure we never put a single one of America's brave sons or daughters or their families in harm’s way without the greatest care and reflection about why we’re doing it and how it benefits our nation. And our responsibility extends to all generations – to our veterans, to our wounded warriors, to the fallen and their families, and those on the frontlines today.  Through our partnership, we’ve made tremendous progress in recent years, and I’m grateful for partnership with this wonderful organization. Today, for example, we know that traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress are factors that increase the risk of suicide.  And we’ve taken action to make sure servicemembers treated for mental health conditions can continue their care as they transition to the VA.  We’re expanding suicide prevention training so warning signs are easier to spot and help is easier to get.  We’re also overhauling our electronic health records with a focus on interoperability across agencies. On transition assistance, we’re upgrading our program so benefits like counseling and financial planning are interlaced throughout service careers, rather than tacked on at the end.  You provide these vital services, too, and we’re grateful. You know, I travel around the country and talk to employers, and the recognition today is widespread, that a veteran makes a fantastic employee. That wasn’t always so. I remember when it was different, when people didn’t understand. And now, with the exception of very few, they do. Better transition assistance is partly why veterans are getting jobs at record rates, and good jobs.  But I think there’s more that we can do.  Thanks to the Legion’s help, we’ve established a credentialing and licensing program to give servicemembers credit where it’s due.  Because if you're certified to drive a truck or provide medical attention in a war zone, you shouldn’t have to get re-certified back home. Over the next few years we expect 1.5 million 9/11 generation vets to join the 2.5 million who’ve already left service.  We need to lay a foundation for veteran support needed 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now. Asking questions about the future is vitally important, and we need to ensure today that every strategic decision we make should be a step towards keeping us safe, protecting our country, and protecting our allies and friends now and in the future. After 9/11, under the weight of important and all-consuming missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, our men and women in uniform performed with tremendous professionalism, skill, and valor – as so many of you have done in your time when called to duty.  As we remain engaged there to preserve gains we’ve helped secure, we must also turn the corner and look ahead to a full spectrum of threats today and into the future – where our focus must be broader than counterinsurgency. In the Asia-Pacific, for example, our rebalance toward that region – where nearly half of humanity and half of the world’s economies reside – is aimed at preserving a security architecture strong enough, capable enough, and connected enough to ensure all nations – all nations – have the opportunity to continue to rise. The United States joins others in that region and around the world in our deep concern about China’s pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea.  We want a peaceful solution to all disputes, but let me be clear: the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all around the world. In Europe, we’re supporting our allies with a new playbook, countering Russian aggression with a strong and balanced approach and bolstering our NATO alliance, which continues to be an anchor for global security.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy.  But make no mistake: while Vladimir Putin may be intent on turning the clock back in Russia, he cannot turn the clock back in Europe.  We will defend our allies…we will defend our allies, we will defend a rules-based international order, and we will defend the positive future that affords us. In the Middle East, the situation is, to put it mildly, complex.  There are threats to our friends from different directions.  But we have our compass, and we know our true north:  We are focused on protecting our interests and our allies and above all, defending our people. First, we will deliver a lasting defeat to ISIL.  With a global coalition of some 60 nations, we’re taking the fight to ISIL across the physical, virtual, and ideological battlespace as it requires.  Our coalition has conducted over 6,500 airstrikes, severely hampering ISIL’s movement and operations and systematically eliminating this evil group’s leadership. Dealing ISIL a lasting defeat means that there must be capable, motivated, local forces on the ground to sustain the defeat.  Otherwise we know from experience that ISIL will be defeated, but then five years, ten years later, something like it will be back. The coalition and us, we can support such local forces but we can’t substitute for them. To date, we’ve trained more than 12,000 Iraqis. We need more. ISIL’s defeat is certain, but it will take time and it will take – require, it will require leveraging all elements of American power, including intelligence, financial, and diplomatic efforts as well as military. Which brings me to a second, important piece of our broader Middle East strategy – the nuclear deal with Iran. Our strategy towards Iran includes, but is not limited to the agreement to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  Let me say outright, this is a good deal, because once implemented, it will remove a critical source of risk and uncertainty in an important but tumultuous region – Iran’s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon.  But while the deal puts limits on Iran, the point I want to make is, the deal places no limits whatsoever on our military and our military option is real and will remain real.  We will continue to protect our friends in the region, especially Israel, from Iran’s destabilizing activities.  As I told some of the more than 35,000 American troops in the region when I visited there last month, deal or no deal the United States military will remain “full speed ahead.” No matter the circumstances in that region or around the world, the bottom line is this: those who wish to do us harm will never find safe haven.  If you threaten American lives – you will answer for it, no matter what it takes. Answering threats today and for years to come demands we look forward and prepare for the future. Last week, I was at Nellis Air Force Base, where we’re conducting exercises with our air forces and– in fact, a joint force, and some allies, working with new technologies and capabilities in space, cyber, and electronic warfare, as well as air warfare.  In that way, Nellis symbolizes our strategic transition, a future where America remains – remains overwhelmingly strong in posture, and retains full spectrum dominance.  After a decade of a focusing on counterinsurgency, we’re turning to all the challenges and opportunities and threats that will define our future security…where we remain strong, and agile, and always ready. Today, the U.S. military has no equal.  We are the best. But to stay the best, we have to embrace the future.  And that has several dimensions.  We have to be open to the wider world of technology.  We need a sensible long-term budget that does right by our military and our taxpayers.  And we need a 21st century personnel system to match a 21st century military – that’s what I call our force of the future. Embracing change to stay the best into the future isn’t a course correction, it’s wind – it’s the wind in our sails. It’s the American way. Quite frankly, it’s what’s we’ve always done to make us strong. First, our unrivaled military must double down on an unrivaled American strength – our capacity for game-changing innovation. We have to be the firstest with the mostest in all of technology fields. As part of my effort to push the Pentagon – to push the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box, as I call it, we’re building stronger bridges between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and the tech communities around the country.  We’re aggressively investing in innovation and pushing R&D in areas like robotics, data science, cybersecurity, biotech, and hypersonic engines that can fly more than five times the speed of sound. I was just in Silicon Valley last week announcing a new public-private partnership to propel flexible hybrid electronics technology. Which, just in case you don’t know what that is, is lightweight, shapeable sensors of the future that can give us real-time damage reports or integrate into smart prosthetics that have the full flexibility of human skin.  Those are some of the applications but the most exciting applications will no doubt be the ones we can’t imagine yet. And that’s just one field of technology. It’s not just about the best technology; you know we need the best people, too.  So we’re drilling tunnels through the wall that sometimes seem to separate government from the innovative private sector – so more of America’s brightest minds can contribute to our mission, even if for a time. All of this – having the best people, maintaining the best technology, and executing the best strategy – takes resources.  That’s the next point I want to make: to support today’s force and meet tomorrow’s threats, we need long-term budget certainty. Our troops need the best training, the newest equipment, and the right compensation.  For too long we’ve been forced to make painful tradeoffs, often on short notice, critically undermining our mission.  Our troops deserve better than the inadequacy of quick-fixes and one year, every year, crisis budgeting.  Indiscriminate cuts from sequestration are wasteful for taxpayers …dangerous for our strategy… unfair for our troops… and frankly, embarrassing in front of the world. We need to come together behind a multi-year approach to our budgeting. The wider catalogue of strategic challenges requires marrying the threat of force with financial and diplomatic leverage.  So I also can’t be, as Secretary of Defense, indifferent to the budgets of the State, FBI, Justice Department, Treasury, Homeland Security, that’s the world in which we live.  I can’t be indifferent to that and I’m not. Failing to fund them too undercuts the full national security apparatus, for example, our collective effort to protect ourselves from ISIL and defeat them. To stay the best, finally, we have to attract and compete for the best talent from a new generation.  And to accomplish this, we need to build the force of the future. You may have read about recent proposals on personnel changes.  We are thinking through many ideas and we need time to get the best ideas and advice, both from our services and from groups like yours, like the Legion.  The people of U.S. Armed Forces are the best, and always will be the best, and how we manage them should be the best, too. We have an all-volunteer force.  So for us to keep recruiting and retaining the best, the military has to be an attractive place to work.  We’re aligning our personnel management system with 21st century trends – like the digital revolution in talent management and the generational reality that some young Americans aren’t satisfied with an industrial-era type career tracks.  They want, you might say, jungle gym careers, where you advance by moving around and having new experiences; not an escalator, where you get on and wait your turn. But not all upgrades you see in the private sector are applicable for our military, because after all, the military is a profession of arms with a unique mission.  Still, we can learn some lessons and get some inspiration from new tools and modern approaches.  Here are some things we’re considering: We’re pushing for flexibility by building on-ramps and off-ramps to give our people more choices, because wherever it’s compatible with service needs, it shouldn’t feel like you have to choose between pursuing a promotion, supporting a family, or getting a quality education. When today’s veterans succeed, it shows tomorrow’s servicemembers that the military can be a launching pad for further success for them.  A few days ago, I met with leaders at the professional networking tech company, LinkedIn.  I sat down with a few veterans who worked there who said it best when they told me that the military isn’t just a great place to go, it’s a great place to be from. In its near-100 years of life, the American Legion has seen the world undergo tremendous change.  That trend continues today, with a more digitized, more connected, and more complex global security environment. But we are a learning organization. That’s what keeps us ahead – adapting, innovating, and rising to the occasion.  We don’t react to change, we wield change. In the century of progress the American Legion helped painstakingly build, you’ve never shied from advocating for what’s fair, insisting on something better, and demanding, above all, that we do right by the people who’ve stepped forward to defend this great nation.  Thank you for that. A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of speaking with Captain Kristen Griest and 1st Lieutenant Shaye Haver – the first women to earn the right to wear the coveted Ranger Tab.  They did what Rangers do: “lead the way.”  Today, it's actually a huge credit for anyone, man or woman, to endure the intense curriculum at Ranger school, and to prevail and to graduate. But these two women are more than a snapshot of the strength of our current force, they represent a broader future trend…where a strategy of attracting the best and staying the best means we keep pace with change and open ourselves to the talents and strengths of all Americans who can contribute with excellence to our force.  Where we modernize our recruitment, our retention, and our readiness in a way that’s worthy of a 21st century force. When put to the test, not everyone – not everyone, only a select few, will meet our standards of combat excellence.  But no one needs to be barred from their chance to be tested.  That’s just one way we’re evolving to retain our place as the finest fighting force the world has ever known. To stay the best, we must keep our focus on our greatest strength, our people… caring for those who serve, and pursuing a strategy suited for this century, in building the force of the future.  If we do right by our people, with thought and commitment and openness and honor…then tomorrow’s veterans will be as good as today’s…and America’s security will be assured for generations to come. Thank you for all you do to make our country strong and secure.

"Aug. 24, 2017","Mr. President, it is an honor to stand alongside you on Ukraine’s Independence Day as a tangible demonstration of our unity and solidarity.  Have no doubt, the United States stands with Ukraine. We support you in the face of threats to your sovereignty and territorial integrity, to international law, and to the international order  We do not, and we will not, accept Russia’s seizure of Crimea.  And despite Russia’s denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe.  Russia put its reputation on the line when it accepted the call for an immediate ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, and to grant the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe unfettered access under the Minsk Agreement.  In 1994, Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum – alongside the United States, United Kingdom and Ukraine – providing Ukraine with assurances that all parties would respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders.  In that memorandum, Russia also promised to refrain from the threat or use of force in exchange for Ukraine’s relinquishment of nuclear weapons.  Once again, under the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, Russia agreed to refrain from the “threat or use of force against each other or any other state, its sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence.”  Unfortunately, Russia is not adhering to the letter, much less the spirit, of these international commitments  The U.S. and our allies will continue to press Russia to honor its Minsk commitments and our sanctions will remain in place until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered them.  As President Trump has made clear, the United States remains committed to diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  I am especially pleased to be here today with Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations.  Ambassador Volker is coordinating carefully with our allies on these efforts.  As Secretary Tillerson said in July, the United States’ goals are to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to seek the safety and security of all Ukrainian citizens, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion.  We in the United States understand the strategic challenges associated with Russian aggression.  Alongside our allies, we remain committed to upholding the widely accepted international norms that have increased global stability since the tragedy of World War II.  Mr. President, we continue to support Ukraine and remain committed to building the capacity of your armed forces.  We applaud Ukraine’s commitment to reform and modernize its defense sector according to NATO standards. This will make Ukraine’s forces more operationally effective as well as more effective protectors of the Ukrainian people. We look forward to full implementation of NATO standards.  The United States and Ukraine are cultivating a lasting strategic partnership, already twenty-five years in the making, built on common security interests and shared principles.  I look forward to continuing to build on that partnership, which we strengthened when President Trump hosted you at the White House in June and reinforced during our meetings here today.

"March 26, 2015","Deputy Secretary Blinken, thank you for that warm introduction.  And thank you for your service to our country – on the Hill, at the White House, and here at State.  You’ve been a tremendous friend to me and to Stephanie and to our men and women in uniform…someone in the Situation Room we knew who always cared about them and their families – and you showed it.  It means a lot, a lot to them. Thank you.  And now you are leading our country’s incredibly skilled and experienced diplomats. I look around the room and see so many of you that I know personally and so many more that I look forward to getting to know and working with in the years ahead.  Thank you for everything you do; that’s going to be the theme of what I have to say to you.  Please go ahead and keep eating, I don’t want to interrupt the flow, and I actually have a lot to say because there’s a lot on our plate these days. I also want to say I’m very grateful to the indefatigable Secretary John Kerry: for inviting me here today, and for his friendship and partnership.  I’m amazed at the energy and enterprise of John Kerry in this job, and it’s a great asset for our great country.  When he invited me to deliver these remarks a few weeks ago, I told him it would be a privilege for me as Secretary of Defense to recognize you in the State Department and your roles in our national security. And I actually spoke to him yesterday morning, before he flew out to Switzerland for one last signal check before today’s talk.  He tried some of his diplomatic tactics on me…but I declined to take his place and go there while he stayed here for these next few days… But I’m glad he’s there today, and I’m especially glad to be here with all of you – 200 of America’s Chiefs of Mission…men and women working on the frontlines to advance our security, our prosperity, and our values.  And I am the first Secretary of Defense, I understand, to address this body and that’s a true privilege, and leads to a kind of question I’ll try to answer later: How could that be so?  Because it doesn’t make any sense to me. But here I am, anyway, and it’s also a privilege for me to speak to you in this room because Benjamin Franklin, who was not only America’s first diplomat, he was also America’s first physicist, a fellow Philadelphian for that matter – but someone who might, and I think John Kerry is said to have said this the other night, could never be confirmed…But that’s a different question. Earlier this week, as Tony mentioned, I spent the day at Camp David with President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah of Afghanistan, accompanied by Secretary Kerry, but also Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, our Director of National Intelligence, Director of the CIA, Deputy National Security Advisor, and senior military leaders.  And together, we addressed Afghanistan’s political, economic, and military future, with their leaders, who were working together because John Kerry brought them together into a national unity government by the way…and we discussed the future of their country, along with the adjustments to our troop withdrawal timeline that President Obama announced Tuesday – adjustments that promote our goal of ensuring that long our campaign in Afghanistan leads to lasting success.  Our discussions at Camp David were a reminder of what a truly integrated, full-court press on national security can look like – on just one particular, important issue, among the world’s many. And that’s what brings me here today: to address why what the State Department does – what every one of you does every day – is critical for our national security.  And to strongly urge Congress to fully support every part of our national security budget, including yours here at State. Reviewing Whole-of-Government Efforts When Thomas Jefferson became our nation’s first Secretary of State, he led this department, I’m told, with a sum total of two ambassadors, ten counselors, and three clerks – and his budget was so tight that he sold one of his horses and some furniture to send money to our missions overseas. State could still use a bigger budget.  And I support that.  But today, over 70,000 State Department personnel, including nearly 14,000 Foreign Service professionals, serve our nation around the world and here in Washington…and whom you lead. What hasn’t changed is that this team – along with so many others from agencies across our government, from Commerce to Treasury to Homeland Security – have to join forces…and must marshal, as the phrase goes, all elements of our national power to address the challenges and very bright opportunities that are before us in the world today. And what also hasn't changed is that, up and down...the chain of command, our men and women in uniform continue to rely on you, America’s top diplomats around the world, for your leadership, for your partnership, and for your deep insights in a turbulent and complex world. Although the term “whole-of-government” and “smart power,” are relatively new – but still already overused – the basic concept clearly isn’t.  It's been around from Sung China to the Holy Roman Empire, the idea of leveraging all  resources of state is an enduring principle of strategy and statecraft. The United States mobilized perhaps the most important whole-of-government effort of the 20th century, namely the Marshall Plan.  And George Marshall – who was an archetypical whole-of-government figure who served as Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and a general officer, and whose portrait I am hanging on my office wall – knew that security couldn’t be addressed in isolation.  As he put it, “restoring the confidence of the European people in the[ir] economic future…[and]…the guarantee for a long, continued peace will depend on other factors in addition to …military strength.” But working across our government has never been easy.  Many, maybe most Secretaries of Defense and State – and the shorter period of the history of Secretaries of Defense - didn’t exactly have a smooth relationship. In the interagency process that produced NSC-68, for example, a famous document, the clash between Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson grew so acrimonious that it provoked Acheson to later write that Johnson’s conduct was so “outrageous” that “it did not surprise [him] when some years later he underwent a brain operation.” In the Reagan years, ""Cap"" Weinberger, for whom I worked, and Al Haig butted heads regularly, and were not actually on speaking terms most of the time. When I started my career during those years in the 1980’s, it was also common for mid- and even some senior-level DoD employees’ – for their world to exist solely within the Pentagon, just with occasional communication to the White House.  Many of them came up that way. Fortunately, we’ve made some headway since then. In the Clinton administration, when I worked for Secretary of Defense Bill Perry – and Warren Christopher was here at the helm in State – Bill would frequently admonish us on his DoD staff never to complain about our State colleagues.  And Chris did the same.  And Bill, in fact, made a point of not backing us up in senseless interagency squabbles.  And so did Chris.  And that word filtered down real fast. And I’m pleased to report today that, although I’ve been Secretary of Defense for only a little over a month, Secretary Kerry already have a great relationship based on, first of all, the fact that we’ve been personal friends for 20 years, but also a shared recognition of the essential value of this partnership to the accomplish our nation’s mission.  And we work with a generation of national security professionals in both agencies who are actually steeped in interagency cooperation. Most of today’s senior officials cut their teeth on the multi-dimensional policy challenges we faced in Haiti and the Balkans in the 1990’s.  And the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan against terror brought even closer interagency cooperation. Secretary Gates even testified before Congress in support of the State Department’s budget submission – what he called a “man bites dog moment.”  And I have done the same.  Senior Defense Department officials have become some  of the most vocal constituents for greater civilian involvement not just in conflict zones, but in -- also in what I have called “preventive defense,” or the influencing the strategic environment to prevent and deter conflict in the first place. Our most battle-tested soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines – from admirals and generals on down – have come to see that, in virtually any context, ensuring victory requires much more than guns and steel.  In conflict zones, it requires good governance, reconciliation, education, and the rule of law.  And in addressing the wider catalogue of strategic challenges, it requires marrying the threat of force with financial and diplomatic leverage. Start with counter-terrorism – and our hand-in-glove cooperation to defeat ISIL. Today, our global coalition’s military campaign is putting ISIL on the defensive.  Just yesterday, the coalition that many of you in this room have built began conducting air strikes around Tikrit.  But we know – we know that defeat of ISIL requires an integrated campaign with equally potent political and economic maneuvers. I have said that ISIL’s defeat must be lasting.  And ISIL’s lasting defeat requires DoD to work closely with you here in the State Department to support the Government of Iraq and the nascent Syrian opposition, and to assemble and then fully leverage the commitment and resources of a vast coalition. It requires USAID to work closely with regional and global partners as refugees continue flowing into Jordan and Turkey. It requires Treasury to choke off ISIL’s resources, while Homeland Security, the intelligence community, and law enforcement together keep watch on our borders and prevent attacks on the United States, and our friends, and allies. For all these reasons, and with Secretary Kerry’s enthusiastic support, in my very first week in this job, in Kuwait I  convened diplomats – including some of you here today – intelligence officials, and military commanders from around the region to sit together at one table to assess our progress and think through  next steps in this campaign. Also consider the sanctions imposed over Iran’s nuclear program, and against Russia over its actions in Ukraine. These are not your father’s sanctions.  Over the last decade, through its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Treasury has radically expanded and sharpened our sanctions toolkit, through close coordination with you in the State Department and the intelligence community.  These tools have allowed us to advance our interests with measured calibration and lower risk of escalation, while imposing real costs on those we’re targeting. These “financial weapons,” as Secretary Lew has called them, have ratcheted up pressure on Russia to end its aggressive actions in Ukraine, as State continues to apply diplomatic pressure and DoD provides military assistance.  And alongside our strong deterrent posture in the Middle East, sanctions have been instrumental in supporting Secretary Kerry’s diplomacy with Iran, as we seek to ensure Teheran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. As Secretary Lew himself has warned, even the most targeted sanctions “still have consequences,” and we must be careful to limit their collateral damage while coordinating closely with our partners and allies.  But over the last decade, these new tools have made an enormous contribution to our national security, and on occasion have helped keep troops out of harm’s way as a result. Next, in the aftermath of tragic humanitarian disasters, we have worked across our government, demonstrating that, in an hour of need, the United States shows up for our closest allies and friends. During my last tour in the Pentagon, in response to the Japanese earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown at Fukushima – four years ago this month – DoD launched Operation Tomodachi, working in partnership with State, USAID, the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and many others to assist our Japanese allies.  And as I believe Ambassador Kennedy would also tell you, this effort powerfully reinforced the U.S.-Japan alliance –demonstrating to Japanese citizens just how deep and how broad our alliance really is. We are also mustering integrated efforts to secure cyberspace – an area where, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Commerce plays a key role in setting critical standards.  The Defense Department is standing up its Cyber Command, which is supported by the National Security Agency and works closely with Homeland Security.  The State Department is leading an effort to build international agreement on norms of state conduct in cyberspace. Each of these national security priorities demands truly integrated operations across our government.  And especially in a constrained overall budget environment, we have no choice but to deploy our resources judiciously and comprehensively. To pack the fullest strategic punch, we need to do a better job developing joint strategies and pooling resources to execute them. We need to adequately fund and empower your mission as our nation’s top envoys. We need to think big and anew – even reimagining the future of our national security machinery – so that we concurrently address classic strategic challenges, such as those in Asia, alongside campaigns that we’re conducting in the Middle East, while also tackling transnational challenges like global health security and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We need to put whole-of-government muscle not only behind our challenges, but also behind our beckoning opportunities – from strengthening and modernizing our longstanding alliances…to advancing our shared prosperity through new trade agreements with Europe and Asia…to building new partnerships with rising powers like India. Investing in Our National Security Budget But as Franklin said, “well done is better than well said.” We can’t just theorize and strategize.  We have to invest in a whole-of-government way. Over the last few weeks, I have testified before Congress on the Defense Department’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal.  Along with our country’s military leadership, I have been vocal and specific about the damage that sequestration-level budgets would inflict on our nation’s defense – on the need to restore readiness, on badly needed technological modernization, and on keeping faith with our troops and their families.  And I want to emphasize that current proposals to shoehorn DoD’s base budget funds into our contingency accounts would fail to solve the problem, while also undermining basic principles of accountability and responsible, long-term planning. And Today, I also want to be clear that, as Secretary of Defense I cannot – and will not – be indifferent to cuts threatening Secretary Kerry’s budget – your budget – here at State. Or to Secretary Lew’s budget at Treasury. Or to Secretary Johnson’s budget at Homeland Security. I cannot be indifferent to the vital national security responsibilities across our government – just as I cannot be indifferent to my own at DoD. Because the military contribution to the Asia-Pacific rebalance could become less potent if we don’t also elevate our trade and diplomatic relationships to a new level. Because our military advances against ISIL could be fleeting, rather than lasting, without State and AID’s diplomacy and assistance. Because just as sequester engenders waste at DoD – leading to more program delays and more cost overruns – it will generate analogous waste at other agencies. And because if dangerous sequester-level budgets are imposed on State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and other agencies, the risks will ultimately accrue to our troops, and to our nation’s security. That is why President Obama has said he will not accept a budget that locks in sequester going forward …or one that severs the vital links between all the pieces of our national security – from State to AID to Homeland Security to DoD. And the President’s commitment also speaks to a broader truth about the relationship between our society, and our economy, and national security.  At the most basic level, the future of our all-volunteer force turns on the health and education of the next generation.  And if we don’t have the infrastructure, basic research, and educational opportunities required for continued and sustained economic growth, we will ultimately shrink the purse that provides our defense dollars. We will imperil our military edge if we do not continue investing in the world’s finest institutions of higher learning and the basic research that underlies cutting-edge technology – not to mention their ability to attract the brightest minds to our shores. It would be especially tragic to neglect investments in the broad foundation of our national power at this moment – a moment when we’re otherwise poised for another American century – as we enter an energy revolution; as we enjoy significant demographic and economic advantages over our competitors; as we enjoy the robust and willing friendship of allies and partners while our potential adversaries enjoy few; and as we continue to cultivate the world’s most vibrant and innovative businesses. I firmly believe that these advantages, and American leadership, are ours to lose. But lose them we will if we don’t invest in our future, whether for gridlock or for folly. That is why President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and I will not waver as we resist proposals that undermine critical investments in all the fundamentals of our national security and national power. This is a time for statesmanship – a time for members of both parties to acknowledge the extraordinary turbulence in today’s world, and to come together behind a long-term budget that stands behind our strength and security as a nation. Full-Court Press on Trade We also need Congress’ support for some of the most important investments we can make in our future prosperity – new trade agreements, including Trade Promotion Authority for the President.  We must be allowed to clinch new and historic trade agreements spanning from Europe to Asia. I offer this as a Secretary of Defense, convinced that a full-court press to strengthen our nation’s trade relationships will reinforce our national security – while neglecting them would undercut it. The arithmetic is straightforward. We know that 95% of the world’s customers live beyond our borders, and the spending power of middle-class consumers in today’s emerging markets is expected to increase by 20 trillion dollars over the next decade. Also consider that, just five years ago, the U.S. and Europe accounted for around 50% of global middle class consumption.  Asia accounted for about 20%.  Five years from now, the U.S. and European share of middle class consumption will shrink to about 30%, while Asia’s will rise to 40%.  And this trend will continue as Asia’s 570 million-strong middle class grows to about [3.2] billion consumers over the next 15 years. These facts help explain why, since the 2008 recession, our nation’s exports have contributed to almost a full third of our economic growth…exports that support more than 11 million American jobs. At the same time, these numbers tell only part of the story because today’s global trade in services – and many products – defies traditional “import” and “export” categories in the first place.  The U.S. jobs we can chalk up to international trade would be even higher if we fold in American workers’ outsize contributions to global value chains. The bottom line is that, as global trade intensifies, we need to be both at the helm, and in the thick of it.  Three years ago, trade accounted for about a third of global GDP.  In a decade, it could approach half of global GDP. America’s economy, and our security that depends on it, cannot afford to be left behind. By underwriting and accelerating economic growth, new trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership stand to help restore our nation’s fiscal health and reverse dangerous defense cuts that are threatening our military readiness and technological edge, as I mentioned. Deeper trade relationships also serve our broader strategic interests.  Prosperity will allow our partners to devote more of their own resources to security – from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, to maritime operations and counter-terrorism. Shared growth generates magnetism: attracting new partners from around the region. While far from a guarantee, strong trade patterns also help build trust and raise the cost of conflict, while assuring our allies and partners of our long-term commitment to a shared and interdependent future…something that Secretary and General Marshall clearly understood. For all these reasons it’s no coincidence that the European Union emerged from habits of cooperation rooted in a fledgling coal and steel community, or that the United States’ first Free Trade Agreement – 30 years ago – was with the State of Israel. For decades, the United States military has helped make the world safe for global commerce that, in full bloom, is delivering prosperity to billions.  Americans deserve to fully benefit from the historic opportunity that they as a nation have created, and that they as taxpayers have underwritten. Conclusion One final point: a full-court press on national security means integrating our strategy.  It means integrating our budgets.  I've said that. But it also means integrating our values – into everything we do. Because the environments in which our military operates are fundamentally shaped by perceptions of what America stands for in the world. Because the conditions we put on military and security assistance show what we value, and help shape the next generation of military leaders around the world. Because the taproots of our military partnerships and alliances are the shared values we together defend and honor. Because the commercial ties that reinforce our nation’s security must reflect what we believe and hold fast to as a nation – from the fundamental dignity of every person…to intellectual property rights that spur and reward growth and innovation… to the opportunity to forge a better life for one’s children. And finally, because living up to our values – the values that you in this room – as the vanguard of this storied, flagship institution – the values you represent and advance every day…living up to those values is how we will sustain our global leadership and continue to inspire new generations of America’s young people to the calling of national security, so that the United States can continue to shine the beacon of hope and opportunity around the world.  All that stands in front of us, and thanks to you, is in our grasp. Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions.

"Oct. 4, 2016","Good afternoon, everyone.  And Stephanie, thanks so much for that introduction – above all, thanks for what you do here.  She’s one of my partners in this great enterprise, and as I look out here in this audience, I see so many others…DoD leaders, colleagues, and then we, of course, have our honorees, their family, and their friends: welcome.  Welcome to this which is the 36th annual Department of Defense Disability Awards Ceremony – 36th. It’s an honor to be with you today to recognize 18 outstanding servicemembers and civilians for their service to our department, our mission, and our nation. From budgets to logistics, management to intelligence and more, these men and women help defend our great country and make a better world for our children. To our honorees, you’re exceedingly valuable members of our team.  You make us smarter and stronger every day by what you do for our mission.  And you help to keep our nation and our people safe.  And what nobler mission in life can there possibly be than that?  I’m proud to have you in the DoD family, and I’m proud to call you colleagues.  Let’s give – first of all – all of our awardees a big round of applause. And – as Stephanie said – this afternoon, we’re also celebrating five DoD components and military departments for exemplary practices in employing individuals with disabilities.  Now, it was almost thirty years ago, in 1987, that then-Secretary Weinberger – and yes, I worked for him – made a pledge to increase the employment of individuals with significant disabilities to 2 percent across the Department of Defense.  While we still have work to do to meet that pledge, our honorees and all our components and military departments have made real progress in hiring – and making our workplaces more accessible to – those with disabilities. Four of the component awards today recognize programs and practices that promote the hiring, the retention, and the advancement of individuals with disabilities.  And we’ve added a new award this year to recognize achievements in ensuring accessible information and communication technology to every employee, which is obviously important in today’s digital workplace. As we recognize these components and military departments, I want to commend the Air Force for “aim[ing] high,” as their motto says, and winning, for the fifth year in a row, the Achievements in Employment of Individuals with Disabilities Award for best military department – way to go, Air Force.  And I also want to acknowledge the great work by our other awardees – the Defense Finance and Accounting [Service] office, Washington Headquarters Services, the National Security Agency, and the Missile Defense Agency.  Let’s give all them a round of applause as well. Now, one thing Stephanie said was true, and that is that my first priority as Secretary of Defense is to our people.  And whether it’s our men and women in uniform, civilians, we have the best people in the world, and that’s what makes ours the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  We recognize, moreover, that the thing that matters most about each person, in turn, is what they can contribute to our great and noble mission.  That’s necessary – that’s a necessary perspective of an all-volunteer force.  We have to start from a position of inclusivity, and not exclusivity because we depend on the most qualified, and we can’t rule anyone out of the pool from which we select the most qualified.  So we need a department where everyone who can serve and wants to serve has the full and equal opportunity to do so.  Anything less isn’t just plain wrong; it’s bad defense policy, and it puts our future strength at risk. We can’t afford that at a time when our department is addressing five rapidly evolving, evolving – I’m sorry – rapidly evolving and immediate, major, international challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single region in the world of greatest consequence to America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And we’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we protect our people here in the homeland.  And we’re preparing to contend, moreover, with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. To meet those challenges, today’s and what lies in the future, we need to keep our military edge as sharp as possible.  And our awardees today – these fine individuals and these departments and components – are doing just that. They’re ensuring that any person who wants to serve – who wants to help us tackle those five challenges and help us seize the many bright opportunities before our nation – can do exactly that. As National Disability Employment Awareness Month begins, we’re reminded of our commitment to live the values we defend – to make the Department of Defense more open and accessible to all who can make a contribution to our mission.  So I encourage all DoD components and military departments to renew their commitment to increase the employment of individuals with disabilities. Together, we will make our workplaces more accessible to all.  We will meet the five challenges we face.  And we will continue to keep America safe long into the future…by harnessing the talents, the skills, and the perspectives of 100 percent of America’s population. Thank you, and congratulations. ",Remarks at DoD Disability Awards Ceremony,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/963957/remarks-at-dod-disability-awards-ceremony/
"Oct. 27, 2016","All, right.  Well, listen, thank you, Dr. Ronis – appreciate it.  Good evening, everyone.  What a terrific video about our honorees, and I'm honored to be here to, in turn, honor them. It’s good to be with all of you, a lot of colleagues past and present, servicemembers, friends.  General Selva, Paul, are you out there?  Paul, Ricky, nice to be with you, as always.  Thanks for holding down the fort while I was away.  I’m also glad Norm Augustine is here with his wife Meg.  Norm, good to see you and Meg, always, always…and also to learn that the men and women of the defense industry of the United States are also being honored this evening – more about that later.  Norm and I have known each other for decades – decades now, Norm.  And I remain, for one here, a devoted reader of Augustine’s Laws. Norm and I attended the so-called “Last Supper” in 1993 when the Pentagon and industry set the course for our relationship in the post-Cold War period.  I’ve said it many times before, but for decades the Department and the defense industry have worked together on the national security team.  I always tell people we don’t make anything at the Pentagon.  The Soviet Union tried that, and it didn’t work out very well for them.  We have a different system, and the companies and the men and women of the defense industry are part of our strength, so I’m glad to see them honoring that fact tonight, and you, Norm and Meg, good to see you. And I also want to thank Dr. Ronis, Larry Rzepka – wherever Larry went, and all the representatives from our National Defense University and the NDU Foundation here tonight – for all you do to educate and support those who serve.  And thank you, as well, for honoring them with this recognition.  I’m, in turn, honored to accept the NDU Foundation American Patriot Award today on behalf of them – the men and women of the Department of Defense…soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, civilians, and contractors. Together – together, they make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known, one we should all take pride in and be thankful for.  All of them – each and every one – are doing one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our country and to make a better world for our children. To do so, they’re confronting – right here, right now as we speak here this evening – five major, unique, and evolving challenges. They’re countering, first, the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, particularly in Europe, where I was just this morning, for a meeting with our NATO Allies in Brussels. They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And they’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria; as well as in Afghanistan, Libya, and everywhere else the ISIL cancer metastasizes around the world; and by helping to protect our homeland and our people here. Indeed, I was in Iraq earlier this week, visiting with our troops in Baghdad and Erbil, which isn’t far from Mosul, where American personnel are advising and enabling our Iraqi partners in the fight against ISIL.  I saw firsthand how they’re continuing to perform with excellence at this milestone in our campaign.  And I was encouraged by how our coalition military campaign plan, particularly the Iraqi-led assault on Mosul, is proceeding according to the plan – the plan we laid out a year ago.  And make no mistake:  Raqqa is next. Now, the Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges – we have to do it all.  And, of course, we must be flexible and agile, because, no matter how excellent NDU studies are, when you look at history, you see that we have an almost unblemished record of failure when it comes to predicting the strategic future.  So we’re preparing to contend, in addition, with an uncertain future – ensuring that our personnel and the Defense Department continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. To meet those five challenges and in the face of that unknown future, DoD is taking steps to remain the most powerful military on earth.  To ensure we do so, to ensure we take care of our people, to ensure we have the right plans and strategies in place, and to ensure we’re prepared for whatever comes our way, I’ve been working every day to meet the three commitments I made when I was sworn in…two years ago now, I guess, and which every Secretary of Defense I’ve ever known – and I’ve worked for 11 of them, with 11 of them – make. And the first, as Secretary of Defense, my first commitment is to our honorees tonight – to our personnel, our men and women, uniform and civilian – to their excellence, to their welfare, to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care and purpose. I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and readiness of today’s fighting force, so they can confront those five challenges – investing in the right training, the right equipment, the right force size, and the right compensation. What that means is, we’re training our force to be ready for full-spectrum combat.  We’re providing them the equipment and maintenance support needed to get the job done and come home safely.  We’re ensuring the right mix of active, guard, and reserve across the force.  And we’re providing the compensation and benefits that our troops, military families, and DoD civilians deserve. But our support for today’s force also involves more than that, it also includes our commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured and support our military families, because they serve too. It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  It also includes our pledge to support our servicemembers when they move on to whatever’s next for them so they can succeed in every way possible.  And it also means that when our servicemembers are not being treated fairly, and with respect, we act quickly to fix it, as we’ve done with the California National Guard bonus issue this week. Of course, our commitment to today’s force also includes what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military. And it also means we have to be open up to all Americans who can meet the high standards of our force, because our strength as an all-volunteer force depends on drawing the best from the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards.  That’s why we opened up all remaining combat roles to women, and we’re welcoming transgender Americans to serve openly. Of course, America’s military deserves only the finest leaders.  And that’s why the best decisions I’ve made as Secretary of Defense have been my recommendations to the President on nominations for the leadership of the force.  That includes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford, Vice Chairman Paul Selva, who’s here tonight as I mentioned, and the rest of the Joint Chiefs, and by now, eight out of our nine combatant commanders – proudest decisions. Understanding the strength of our force and our capabilities helps me honor my second commitment, which is to the President of the United States and our Commander-in-Chief – to offer President Obama my best strategic counsel, to ensure that he receives candid military advice, and to execute his decisions with DoD’s expected and accustomed excellence. We’ve done so on each of the five challenges we face.  In Europe, we’ve developed – and we’re implementing – a strong and balanced strategy to deter Russian aggression against our NATO allies in Europe.  In the Asia-Pacific, we’ve crafted the latest phase of our rebalance to that region, and now we’re operationalizing it and catalyzing the region’s burgeoning principled and inclusive security network.  In the face of North Korea’s continued aggression, we’ve modernized our alliances with Japan and South Korea, deployed new capabilities to defend our allies, our forces, and our homeland, and reaffirmed that our extended deterrence commitments are unbreakable. In the Middle East, as the United States continues to monitor Iran’s adherence to the nuclear accord, we’re taking our defense relationships with Israel and our Gulf partners to new levels.  And on ISIL, one year ago, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations by me and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford, to begin gathering momentum in the fight against ISIL. We’ve achieved significant results to date – helping our local partners in Iraq and Syria to recapture Ramadi, Hit, Fallujah, Qayyarah, Shaddadi, Manbij, Dabiq, and more, and now…now execute our plans for Mosul and Raqqa.  And I’m confident our campaign plan, our global coalition, and the local partners we’ve developed and enabled will help deliver ISIL the lasting defeat it deserves and will surely get. Meanwhile – even as we’ve been executing all those missions – we’ve also been laying the groundwork and charting a path for a more agile, innovative, and efficient military and Defense Department to serve and protect our nation in the years to come.  And that’s because my third commitment – after our people and our Commander-in-Chief – is to the future…to keeping our military edge as sharp as possible in a changing and fiercely competitive world. And to stay ahead of our competitors and challenges – to stay the best – I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box…to invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds:  in our technology, in our operations, in our people and all-volunteer force, and in our organization. That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re also innovating operationally, making our contingency plans and operations more flexible and more dynamic in every region. It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we need to continue to recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent from future generations.  And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise – from continuously improving acquisitions, to further reducing overhead, and to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization. Because we’re doing all this – because we’re meeting these three commitments – and because of our nation’s enduring strengths – like, our growing, innovative economy, our world-class universities – places of instruction like NDU, our dedication and service to values and principles, our unrivaled network of allies and partners, and of course, our unmatched, battle-tested, innovative, and awesomely capable military, because of all that, I’m sure that the future for our country is bright and full of opportunities for our nation to seize. And I am confident that the United States will maintain our unrivaled military strength for decades and remain the world’s foremost leader, partner, and provider of security in every region across the globe. But I never forget – and we can never forget – who makes it all happen.  And you know the answer…because you chose to honor them tonight…it’s our people.  And we have a few of them here with us.  And let’s give them a round of applause, and would they stand?  Paul, you’re going to need to lead the way here. Each of you, and each of your fellow servicemembers and DoD civilians, make me incredibly proud – make this country proud.  You’re some of the nearly 3 million men and women serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, and in every domain…in the air, ashore, afloat, and in cyberspace – all in service to this great nation. All of you are defending not only the United States and its people; you’re also defending the values and principles that define us – and which, by the way, so much of humanity also desires – while you provide the security that will enable our children to live a better future. Because you do so, we can sit here and enjoy this dinner in peace.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at schools like NDU.  Americans  can live our lives, they can dream our dreams, and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought. You make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want you to know that we don’t take you for granted.  Stephanie and I wake up to you every morning…wake up for you every morning, thinking of you.  I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing, but I couldn’t be prouder of you for what you do every day – and for all you’ve done for us. Your excellence is unparalleled.  Your service is valued.  And your sacrifices will never be forgotten. May God bless you, and all men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known – and may God bless the United States of America.

"July 31, 2015","Good morning.  Mary, thank you.  Stephanie and I – where are you Steph, my better half right there, Stephanie – we just met a few kids from the “Student to Student program,” your program.  What a simple and powerful idea: local military children – including some non-military children – who take it upon themselves to be ambassadors to new-military-children who’ve just moved nearby.  It’s a great take on the tradition of sponsorship in our military – of new transitions to new bases and new communities.  Thanks to this organization, that tradition has been passed to the next generation and that’s something to be proud of. That’s just one innovative way this coalition supports our military kids beyond the classroom.  And I want to thank you for orchestrating this tremendous training seminar, and for being the Department of Defense’s go-to partner on all things affecting the well-being of our military children – it means a lot to us.  And, of course, I want to thank the teachers, the counselors, the administrators, and the parents here today for your service to our next generation – for committing your mission to making their stories, success stories. To the people in this room, the scope of our mission is clear.  Think about it this way: for our recent high school graduates, the entire time they’ve been in school – during elementary school spelling bees, junior high pep rallies, and senior proms – America has been at war. Last week, I spoke to our men and women on the front lines in Iraq.  Many of them are parents; many of those who aren’t hope to be someday.  For most of their lives – America has been at war. Regardless of the tumultuous reality they’ve lived in, military children continue to muster the same grit and courage that their parents devote to defending our country.  That's what really makes our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known – our people.  They’re our ‘secret sauce’…and not just our warfighters, but also their families – and their kids – who proudly embrace their service.  Kids like Marguerite Flynn, whose story was told in MCEC’s “On the Move” magazine.  Marguerite is in high school.  Her dad is a Coast Guardsman; they’ve moved six times in her life.  She says moving is both the best and most challenging thing about being a military kid.  When Marguerite was asked about the most important thing people should know about military children, I’m told she said, quote, “Kids serve, too.” Kids do serve, too.  She’s right.  So many kids like Marguerite proudly own their service.  They’re determined, creative, and wise beyond their years, and they seize their ‘story’ – their unique experiences – as an opportunity.  Our challenge – the challenge this coalition has valiantly taken on – is to provide the support they need to succeed. As may have been mentioned earlier, I think it was, long before I was ‘Secretary Carter,’ at one time I was ‘Professor Carter.’ So I’m an educator, too.  As educators, we know education is critical to a richer quality of life for our people; as Americans, we know education is critical to a vibrant democracy; but as Secretary of Defense, I can tell you the education of our military children is critical to our mission, to our security, and to building what I call the force of the future – the military that will defend our country in the years to come. Let me say why.  It’s true that a capable, dynamic force of the future will depend on maintaining an unmatched operational edge and unmatched capabilities.  But it’s more than just advanced weapons platforms that keep people safe, people keep people safe.  It’s our men and women and uniform, and their families – their conviction, their courage, and their sacrifice – let me just say it again – it’s that, that makes our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. If we’re going to stay the best, the U.S. Armed Forces has to be an attractive, inviting, supportive place to serve for families of all kinds.  The world is changing.  The labor market is changing.  Younger generations and young families want flexibility and choice in their career paths.  We know that. More and more, we’re seeing they want to be on a jungle gym, where you advance by moving around and having new experiences; not an escalator, where you get on and wait your turn. DoD has to keep up – and keeping up means being more responsive to the needs of our military families and their children.  That’s our obligation.  But given today’s abundance of career paths to choose from, we can’t take for granted that military children are twice as likely as other kids to join the military.  Nor can we take for granted military parents’ inclination to recommend military service to their own children. There’s tremendous value in families upholding a tradition of service that is passed from generation to generation.  It makes our military stronger.  There’s no substitute for the unique, potent mix of passion and mentorship that comes from a military mom, dad, or grandad in the case of one of the kids I was speaking to earlier today – or all of them. I recently got a letter from a 4th grader who wrote, quote, “Dear Mr. Secretary, I want to be in the military because I want to defend our country and our country's freedoms.  My mom and dad are in the Air Force and that is what inspired me."" There it is.  That’s a great reason.  But military children like that future airman, who already see the virtue of their parents’ service, also see their peers chase those jungle-gym style careers.  They, too, see businesses trending toward more family-flexibility, more opportunities to pursue higher education, and fewer long-term commitments.  So we have to adapt to keep up and compete for talent.  And when we make the Department of Defense a more attractive place to join across the board, the virtue of service becomes a more worthwhile endeavor for military and civilian families alike. So our force of the future should be family-focused – parents in uniform should never feel like they have to choose between pursuing a promotion and supporting their family. To give families more flexibility, we’re expanding maternity and paternity leave and we’re creating on ramps and off ramps between active duty and the reserves, so our personnel don’t have to derail their careers to get an advanced degree or have a family. To give servicemembers and their families greater choice, we’re overhauling the way we place personnel, too – to offer more options and potentially, potentially but not always, fewer moves – meaning fewer first days as the “new-kid-in-school.” To give families more opportunity, we’re making sure that serving in uniform doesn’t mean you have to trade in your aspirations to wear a cap and gown if that’s what you want to do.  The post-9/11 G.I. Bill has helped over 1.3 million Americans pay for college – and those benefits are transferable to family members.  And we’re looking for ways to make it work even better. Those are just a few ways we’re working hard to be more responsive to the needs of our modern military families, which of course support our military kids.  But when it comes to education, we have a specific set of tools we use to deliver direct support in the classroom. More than 74,000 kids attend DoD-run schools, overseen by our Department of Defense Education Activities office, or DoDEA.  Our schools have good teachers, high graduation rates, and above average SAT scores.  We’re doing well, but we can always do better. That’s why, starting with this coming school year, we’ll begin adopting “College and Career Ready Standards” across all DoD schools – so our military kids can hit the ground running in college, and be first in line for 21st century jobs. But DoD schools are only a small part of military child education, as you all know.  More than 90 percent of military children attend local public schools.  So working hand-in-hand with groups like this is essential to pushing progress outside the Department’s own schools. We’re working together to make moving easier on kids.  One way is by creating a Military Dependent Student Identifier – which lets parents, educators, and schools track performance, funnel resources, and make smart policy decisions on behalf of our military children over their entire educational careers.  If we know how particular groups of kids are performing, we can better target resources to maximize their success.  DoD firmly supports creating the identifier, and we greatly, greatly, appreciate MCEC’s ironclad support. We’re also working to extend our reach in creative ways.  Case in point is our competitive Educational Partnership Grant Program – where funds go toward local schools with 15 percent or more military kids enrolled.  Those funds recently paid for a STEM partnership that helped more than 10,000 high school students earn AP exam scores that qualified for college credit.  That’s an incredible return on investment.  I’m proud to say that this year’s round of funding totals $52 million – and I want to thank MCEC for your continued support of the program. And let me just make clear that we’re also open to new ideas, and I hope all of you will think of us as a partner and resource as you tackle these challenges in your districts and neighborhoods. I want to close with a story about a visit I made to Yakota Air Base in Japan this past April, during the Month of the Military Child.  I had the chance to spend some quality time with military families and kids.  It’s the best part of this job, hands down.  And I met some five-year-old students making bird feeders in a craft class – in my day, I remember making ash trays … It goes to show how priorities and times have changed. To boost our military children’s potential, we must change, too.  Our security demands it.  The force of the future demands it.  And the flexible, thorough support of our modern military families and kids demands it.  Together, we can meet that demand. I could tell you that our military children are resourceful and resilient.  I could tell you they’re courageous and compassionate.  And I could tell you they’re proud of their parents and proud to serve alongside them...but instead, I’m going to let a military child tell you in her own words. MCEC published a poem by Katie, a 6th grader who goes to school on Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.  Her poem is titled, “Military Girl,” – and I’m going to recite a few lines. Quote: ""…I am not in the rank of command, orders I do not get. But my dad is the one who does, this I cannot forget. I am not the one who fires the weapon, who puts my life on the line. But my job is just as tough, I am the one who left friends behind...My dad makes the sacrifice; my dad works to keep this country free, But so do my mom, brother, sister, and me. Even though it might get a little wild, I stand with the rank known as the Military Child.” That poet, Katie, is one of nearly 2 million military children whose parents’ serve among our active-duty, Guard, and Reserves.  That’s the scope of our education challenge – and our opportunity. Marguerite, Katie, and thousands of kids like them give us a glimpse of the grit and wisdom our military children have, and need, to make their lives work.  Our mission is to have their back.  To cheer them on.  To make sure their stories are success stories, happy stories, and stories of fulfilled lives.  Because the brave men and women who defend our freedoms and risk their lives all over the world – deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing their families are taken care of back home. Thank you for all you do.

"June 30, 2016","Good afternoon, everyone. Guests, particularly of Secretary Albright, leadership of the department.  It is a great privilege to welcome Secretary Madeleine Albright to the Pentagon and to be joined today by so many long-time friends, colleagues, and dedicated public servants, including members of our Defense Policy Board. While there’s no need to explain any recognition of Madeleine’s historic achievements and extraordinary work, it might seem odd to some of you that a Secretary of Defense would give the Department of Defense’s highest award to a Secretary of State. But it shouldn’t seem strange.  That’s because this award represents an enduring truth: our defense is so vital that we must shepherd it from strategic era to strategic era, from administration to administration, across parties, and across our government.  Defense requires a strategic perspective – that we understand our connections to the leaders and challenges of the past. At the UN, in Foggy Bottom, and today, Madeleine has always kept the world in synoptic view, seeing all of its parts and problems at once, and using the great physical and moral strength of the world’s greatest nation wisely, to protect our people and make a better world. She’s always demonstrated a deep understanding of which mix of our nation’s foreign policy tools– whether it’s the nation’s exceptional diplomatic corps, our economic might, or the finest fighting force the world has ever known – is best for a given issue.  She’s always understood where present challenges fall in the broad arc of history, and how we can use history’s lessons to pursue today’s opportunities.  And she’s always known that in a complex and tumultuous world, our policy must be grounded in our interests and our ideals. As Madeleine knows well from her work on the Defense Policy Board, this perspective and this complexity is something we contend with every day at the Department of Defense, as we face a new strategic era, with no fewer than five major, immediate, and evolving challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it’s metastasizing around the world. While we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges, we do have the ability to set a strategic course for the future: a future that’s uncertain moreover, and that will bring with it new and unforeseen challenges, but that will surely demand America’s leadership, values, and military strength. Now, as we set that strategic course, meet those challenges, and contend with that uncertain future, we can learn important lessons from Madeleine’s remarkable career…about the need for whole-of-government policy responses, about the strategic benefits of global partners, and about the enduring importance of American values and ideals. Madeleine has always known that strategic objectives must be pursued across government, with the support of every agency and every instrument of American strength.  That’s because ensuring victory in war requires much more than combat power alone.  The peace and stability that America’s servicemembers – like those whose names line the walls of this wonderful room – the peace and stability they fight for and sacrifice for also require just governance, meaningful reconciliation, improved education, economic progress, and the rule of law.  And, at State and in her continued work as chair of the National Democratic Institute, Madeleine has helped develop and advance the instruments and institutions needed to make and keep peace. She’s done so, in part, because Madeleine appreciates the enduring need to marry the United States’ economic and diplomatic leverage with our military might.  Few have been a more forceful and effective advocate for that sort of approach to national security policy than Madeleine Albright.  In the 1990s she worked for whole-of-government responses to, among other issues, end crises in Bosnia and Kosovo, counter nuclear proliferation, and normalize trade with China and diplomatic relations Vietnam.  I saw all this and more up close, and I have known and admired Madeleine ever since. Twenty-one years ago this summer – and I remember this well – in the wake of tragedies like the attacks on Srebrenica, Madeleine worked with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Secretary of Defense Bill Perry – for whom I was then working, National Security Advisor Tony Lake, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili, and many others, including Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, to develop a comprehensive American intervention – one that leveraged our military and allied strength and all our diplomatic firepower – to end the Bosnian War with the Dayton Accords. Madeleine’s work on Bosnia and later on Kosovo also reminds us of the importance of working with – and listening to – our unrivaled network of allies and partners, which no other country has.  That long-time network is an important strategic asset, one nurtured by generations of policymakers like Madeleine. America’s representatives – whether on the Cabinet or the Joint Chiefs, in the Foreign Service or our military ranks – do the same today by embodying our values and ideals.  I hear this all the time about America’s servicemembers.  Defense leaders everywhere I go tell me they like working with our military.  That’s because our people aren’t only awesomely competent, but they also don’t intimidate, coerce, or exclude…they work with our allies and partners to ensure a better world.  That reputation makes me proud. But it also makes our country stronger.  To ensure that unrivaled network of friends and partners in a changing world, we need to continue to embody our values and principles, to work with allies, and to listen to them.  Madeleine’s example is a good one to model. That was on display this spring when Madeleine gave a terrific commencement speech at Scripps College, in which she explained how people with different opinions, interests, and values – whether at home or around the world – can be brought together for common cause. Madeleine said, and I quote, “The challenge for our leaders is not to eliminate the diversity of…perspectives – for that’s not possible.  The challenge is to manage them – and when necessary, moderate them – so that we are not defined primarily by what keeps us apart.” Of course, as an immigrant to this country, Madeleine herself has always brought additional empathy to her work and a deeper appreciation for the need to bridge differences and opinions.  And over the course of her career and in her post-government work, Madeleine has brought us together again and again to make a better world. As she’s done so, Madeleine’s helped ensure our nation is safer, stronger, and, yes, indispensable.  And because she’s stood up for America’s standards and ideals – shared by people and nation’s around the world – she’s also helped make the world more peaceful, and its people freer, healthier, and more prosperous. In Washington and in the academy, it’s popular to say that “where you stand depends on where you sit.”  But Madeleine’s an exception.  Whether on Capitol Hill, at the State Department, on the NSC, or at the UN, her colleagues always knew where Madeleine stood on an issue: for standing up and standing by America’s ideals in the complex eras in which she’s worked…and still works.  As she’s helped ensure the United States does so, she has ruffled some feathers – in this building, in the interagency, around the world – she wouldn’t be the Madeleine Albright we all know and love if she hadn’t.  But she’s also inspired her colleagues and her country to remember and rededicate themselves – and ourselves – to those values and ideals. Madeleine has said that, “A successful foreign policy must begin with the world as it is but also work for what we would like it to be.”  In her work, Madeleine’s made Washington, her country, and our world what we’d all like them to be: more civilized, more secure, and more hopeful. Madeleine, yours has been an American life.  Nowhere else would your story have been possible.  And you’ve dedicated your life to the life of your country.  As you’ve done so – and as you continue to do so – you represent the very best of this nation: we’ve never settled for the expedient, we’ve long strived for the exceptional.  So have you. On behalf of the men and women of the Defense Department, and on behalf of a grateful nation, Madeleine, we thank you. So it is now my great honor to present the Distinguished Public Service Award to Secretary Madeleine Albright. Thank you.

"Sept. 18, 2015","Good morning.  Thank you, Chairman, for those kind words and above all for your service.  You’ve made it matter every day you’ve been our chairman. Now on November 20, 1943, American Marines and sailors began an assault on Betio, an island in the Pacific, on the Tarawa Atoll.  The United States believed securing Tarawa was critical, but it was so heavily defended that one enemy commander claimed, quote, “a million Americans couldn't take Tarawa in 100 years.” Well he was wrong.  Americans took Tarawa in 76 hours…but at a heavy cost.  Over those three days, more than 1,000 Americans died and more than 2,000 were wounded.  Too many were buried in graves quickly lost to history. Senator Cotton, distinguished guests, colleagues past and present, thank you for being here on this important day to talk about one of our most important commitments: to members of service like them, to bring them, our men and women in uniform, like those lost at Tarawa, home to their families. Thank you as well to the family and veterans organizations whose advocacy helped establish National POW/MIA Recognition Day and raise the POW/MIA flag over the Pentagon and above buildings around the country.  And, most importantly, thank you to the veterans, including many former POWs, and the families of those still missing who join us – you honor us with your presence. In a year of anniversaries – when we mark the 150th anniversary of the Civil War’s end, the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, and the 40th anniversary of the Vietnam War’s end – today we remember that even when war ends, not everyone comes home.  And we recommit to making sure they do.  That’s because – as Chairman Dempsey explained – we never forget. While we currently – and thankfully – have no American POWs in captivity from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we know what that commitment means for our servicemembers who were held captive and those who waited for them here at home, and for all those serving today. We can ask Bob Davis, who is here with his wife Floss, and their grandson Coast Guard Lieutenant Taylor Kellogg.  After landing in France nine days after D-Day, Bob fought in the battles of Saint-Lô and Mortain before being captured by German soldiers.  He was held as a POW for six months. And we can ask Tom Horio, also here with us today.  Tom arrived in South Vietnam in December 1968 where he served with the 1st Battalion of the 10th Cavalry Regiment before being captured in May 1969.  He spent over 1,400 days in captivity as a POW before he was released as part of Operation Homecoming in 1973. Bob and Tom, on behalf of President Obama and the entire Department of Defense, thank you for your service.  Thank you for your sacrifice. Some of our service members, our civilians, and their families have made the ultimate sacrifice.  To keep our commitment to them, Defense Department personnel travel all around the world, working in quiet archives, remote field sites, and cutting-edge forensic labs. I saw some of this work in June at a Defense Department personnel accounting office in Hanoi, where I also visited the lake where John McCain’s aircraft was shot down before he was taken prisoner.  Senator McCain, once a Vietnam POW, is now the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a result of the Department’s worldwide efforts, this year, Marine Private Jack Redman, who fought and died in Tarawa, was among those returned home and buried.  So was Army Corporal Nehemiah Butler, who was killed in action south of Seoul in 1950.  And also Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Ed[win] Morgan, who was lost on an armed reconnaissance mission near the Laos-Vietnam border in 1966. But we still have work to do.  Far too many families still have to wonder about the fates of their fathers and grandfathers, their husbands, sisters.  Today, today there are 73,515 missing from World War II; 7,841 missing from the Korean War; 126 missing from the Cold War; and 1,626 missing from the Vietnam War. As we work to provide the fullest possible accounting to those families, we continue to improve our personnel accounting program and find new ways to meet one of our oldest and most sacred obligations. Our POW/MIA programs, improvement programs rather, are coming on-line.  Over the past year, with Congress’s encouragement and support, the Defense Department created the new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which combined the activities and resources of three different organizations and over 600 staff [members]. Amid the reorganization, we have identified 67 missing servicemembers this year, and we expect to identify more.  That’s a relief to their families, though it is also short of where we aim to be.  But we have opportunities to make additional progress – for example, we are working diligently to identify those lost at Pearl Harbor aboard the U.S.S. Oklahoma and buried as unknowns in Hawaii. We, we here, are a learning organization, always striving to be at the forefront of everything we do.  That’s why we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Just as the lessons we learned in our 20th century wars helped us improve how we have cared for the wounded, the fallen, and their families during our recent wars…we’re using 21st century methods to meet our commitments to those who served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War, and remain missing. We’re looking to expand our work and expand our partnerships.  Our work with the nonprofits History Flight and BentProp are two examples of our collaboration with private organizations and individuals.  We are also working with academic and other foreign partners to help account for our missing. We’re also harnessing new technology.  Investments and advances in forensic science will allow us to identify the previously unidentifiable remains of some of the fallen.  And we recently opened a state-of-the art facility in Hawaii to help us take advantage of these new methods. And that’s why we’re using new communication channels to keep in touch with the families of the missing.  We’re developing a password-protected, cloud-based website that will allow our families to be informed around the clock. One of the reasons our men and women in uniform will stop at nothing to achieve their missions, on Tarawa or Saint-Lô, at Inchon or Khe-Sanh, in Fallujah or Helmand, is that they know we’ll stop at nothing to bring them home to their families. I’m sure that’s one reason why Private Redman served so valiantly on Tarawa 72 years ago.  Though Tarawa was his first experience with combat, he fought heroically, only to be shot by a sniper on the third and final day of the battle.  One of Private Redman’s childhood friends said of him, quote, “he died a hero's death.”  His remains, though, were lost, buried on Tarawa with many others. But, last year, a piece of dog tag was found.  When it was examined, the letters R-E-D could be identified.  His remains were subsequently recovered by a DPAA team and as a result, this May, Private Redman was given a hero’s burial in Illinois. Every man and woman in uniform may not fight in battles like Tarawa…I hope they don’t.  But every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and Coast Guardsman should know that we will, we will – I will – do everything we can to bring them back to their families, as we helped do with Private Redman. Thank you again to Bob Davis and Tom Horio, and the rest of the veterans here and around the country.  And thank…you for being with us this morning.  May God bless you, bless your families, and bless this great nation in the years to come.

"Sept. 22, 2016","Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee: Thank you for hosting me and Chairman Dunford today, and also for hosting the Chiefs of the military services last week.  I particularly appreciated your comments to them about the inefficiencies and dangers of continued budget instability and gridlock, as well as the risk of sequestration’s looming return.  I look forward to addressing those topics and more during today’s hearing. I also appreciate your support for our men and women serving around the world, civilian and military alike, who are the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, or more capable, or more innovative, or more experienced, or with better friends and allies.  That’s a fact – one that every American ought to be proud of. As you know, the Department of Defense is currently addressing each of the five major, immediate, evolving challenges we face, which Chairman Dunford and I discussed with you during our budget testimony this past spring – challenges from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism.  And on that note, in the wake of this week’s attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, we remain absolutely determined, as ever, to continue countering terrorists around the world who would seek to do harm to our country and our people. We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges, which is why American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are working with partners from our worldwide coalition in more ways and with more power every day to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do and want to do soon.  They’re also training and operating with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula, helping strengthen our deterrent and defenses in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re countering Iran’s destabilizing influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East.  All the while, they’re helping protect our people here at home and helping to make a better world for our children.  And they’re preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring we continue to stay the best and stay ahead in a changing and competitive world. As Chairman Dunford and I testified not only to this committee, but to all four of our defense oversight committees in the spring, we’ve been planning for these operations to be paid for by the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 defense budget we developed.  And this budget not only adhered to last fall’s bipartisan budget deal in overall size; in shape, it marked a strategic turning point for DoD – making and sharpening breakthrough investments in supporting new operational concepts, in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, in reforming the DoD enterprise, and in building the force of the future.  That budget also put an extremely high premium on continued funding to rebuild the readiness of our forces – requiring not only stable resources, but also time – the importance of which you heard about from the Chiefs last week.  Nothing is more important than readiness to me or them.  And yet today, just eight days away from the end of this fiscal year and the beginning of the next, that budget has yet to be funded by Congress – another topic, and a challenge, that I’ll address in greater detail shortly. Because this hearing is focused in part on ongoing military operations, let me begin with an operational update focusing specifically on our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  Counter-ISIL Operational Update In each of the four times that Chairman Dunford and I have appeared before this committee since last October, I walked you through how we were continually accelerating this campaign – starting with outlining our coalition military campaign plan, which is focused on three objectives that I’ve stressed consistently. The first objective is to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  ISIL’s occupation of territory in those countries threatens not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and the stability of that vitally important region, but also the security of our own citizens and those of our friends and allies.  That means the sooner we defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria – the sooner we destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology – the safer all of us will be.  That’s why we’re applying simultaneous pressure on ISIL from multiple directions and across domains – on the ground, from the air, and in cyberspace.  We’re doing all this consistent with our strategic approach, which is to enable capable, motivated, local forces – for that is the only way to defeat ISIL and keep them defeated, ensuring a lasting defeat. Now, while defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria is necessary, it’s not sufficient. Indeed, we know this cancer can metastasize, and in some cases it already has.  This brings me to the second objective of our coalition military campaign plan, which is to combat ISIL’s metastases around world.  And that’s why U.S. and coalition forces are engaged in supporting capable, motivated local forces in operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, in Libya, and elsewhere, and in countering ISIL across the intangible geography and terrain of the Internet. Our third objective is to help protect the homeland.  Here, recent events continue to emphasize the importance of this mission.  This is mainly the responsibility of our partners in the FBI, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community, and state and local law enforcement.  But DoD strongly supports them in a number of important ways that I’ll describe in more detail later in this testimony. Now, as I noted, Chairman Dunford and I have seen you several times since last October, when we first described to you our plan to accelerate the campaign against ISIL.  And since then, we’ve taken a great many steps to do just that.  As we take advantage of new opportunities generated by new intelligence, newly trained partners, and strikes against ISIL leaders, infrastructure, and finances, we’re generating more new opportunities, and then seizing those opportunities to repeat this cycle – reinforcing success.  And I should note that every time Chairman Dunford and I have recommended additional accelerating actions to President Obama, he has approved them. Let me briefly remind you of the initial steps we took beginning last fall to start accelerating the campaign.  First, we deployed additional strike aircraft to Incirlik to support an expanded air campaign against new targets and new categories of targets illuminated by refined intelligence.  We deployed an initial contingent of special operations forces to Syria.  We expanded efforts to equip Syrian Arab Coalition forces engaged in the fight against ISIL.  We began enabling capable, motivated local forces in southern Syria as well, and enhancing Jordan’s own border control and defenses.  We leveraged air power and advisors to help the Peshmerga take Sinjar, cutting the Iraqi side of the main line of communication between ISIL’s power centers in Raqqa and Mosul.  We introduced an expeditionary targeting force to go after ISIL leaders wherever they may be attempting to hide.  We worked to improve our ability to target ISIL’s leadership and presence beyond Iraq and Syria.  We started to expand the military campaign against ISIL to every domain, including cyber.  We stepped up our homeland defense and force protection measures to counter any additional threats to our facilities and our personnel at home and abroad.  We began precision strikes against ISIL senior leaders and training camps in Libya – removing ISIL’s leader there, Abu Nabil, for instance.  And we went after ISIL in Afghanistan. These were followed this past spring and summer with even more accelerants.  In Iraq, in close coordination with the Iraqi government, I announced we would be adding additional personnel there to enable the Iraqis to make faster progress in Anbar and Ninewa Provinces.  I also announced that we would be placing advisors with the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) down to the brigade and battalion level; leveraging Apache attack helicopters to support the ISF’s efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul; sending additional High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) batteries to support the Iraqi ground offensive there; and, providing financial assistance to the Peshmerga, up to $415 million, to bolster one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIL.  Meanwhile, in Syria, we announced a six-fold increase of U.S. forces there, from 50 to 300, to help expand ongoing efforts to identify, train, and equip capable, motivated local anti-ISIL forces inside Syria, especially among the Sunni Arab community.  And in addition to initiating training inside Syria, we’ve also continued to refine our train-and-equip efforts of other vetted Syrian forces outside of Syria, using the important authorities and funding provided to us by Congress under the Section 1209 program – and here, as I’ve described to you before, we’re keeping our focus on battle-hardened, proven anti-ISIL leaders whom we could make more capable as enablers and amplifiers of our effects. At the same time, in addition to accelerating the campaign with more U.S. capabilities, we renewed our outreach to coalition members, including in Europe, in the Middle East, and in Asia.  And over the last nine months, I’ve convened my counterparts several times – in Paris, Brussels, Riyadh, Stuttgart, and here in Washington this past July – not only to rally them behind the campaign plan and the next steps in its execution, but above all to urge them to contribute more, and in more meaningful ways.  As we’ve done more, so have our partners.  That collaboration will continue. In sum, we steadily executed the campaign plan and first set of plays we devised and I described to this committee many months ago.  Now we’re on to the next plays in our campaign, which you’ll recall Chairman Dunford and I previewed for you in April, and are now underway – more on that in a moment. Because the acceleration of our campaign has continued since then, I’d like to now update you on the latest results of the coalition’s military campaign, as well as what we will need to do going forward. Destroying ISIL’s Parent Tumor Let me begin with our first objective, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  Here, since last fall – town after town, from every direction, and in every domain – our campaign and operations have accelerated, pressuring and squeezing ISIL, and rolling it back towards Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.  While we have much more work to do – including to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa – the results of our efforts are showing. In Iraq, we’ve been enabling the Iraqi Security Forces led by Prime Minister Abadi and the Kurdish Peshmerga commanded by Iraqi Kurdistan Regional President Barzani.  After retaking Ramadi and establishing a staging base at Makhmour, the ISF went on to retake Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, and the important airfield and town of Qayyarah – setting the stage to complete the envelopment and isolation of Mosul and collapse ISIL’s control over it.  In the last few days, the ISF began operations to retake Sharqat and other towns surrounding Mosul.  And the final assault on Mosul will commence – as with previous operations – when Prime Minister Abadi gives the order.  In the meantime, the coalition has been actively laying the groundwork with the generation of necessary Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga, preparation of staging areas, and positioning of our strike assets to cover the assaulting Iraqi and Kurdish forces.  In close coordination with the Iraqi government, these efforts are being bolstered by the addition of 560 U.S. troops I announced in July.  And we stand ready to contribute even more, in consultation with our Iraqi partners. In Syria, our coalition has also enabled considerable results by our local partners.  There, local forces retook Shaddadi – severing a key link between Raqqa and Mosul, and thereby ISIL in Iraq and ISIL in Syria – and then Manbij City – clearing a key transit point for ISIL’s external operators and plotters, and letting us gain intelligence insights that have helped us map ISIL’s network of foreign fighters.  Additionally, our ally Turkey is helping local Syrian partners clear the Turkish-Syrian border region of ISIL.  We’re working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Turks, supporting those efforts from the air, on the ground, and with intelligence, and we will continue to coordinate with them as we have with all of our partners so far.  And in that regard, I welcome the Turkish government’s comments about the importance of working with local partners. As we do all this, we are managing challenges that we’ve foreseen, including friction between some of our partners and also political instability.  That’s why our forces and commanders on the ground and in the region remain laser-focused on overcoming these challenges, so we can continue to accelerate our campaign. Indeed, even with the considerable results achieved so far, we are not letting up.  Across both Iraq and Syria, our coalition continues to pressure ISIL in several key ways. We’re systematically eliminating ISIL’s leadership: the coalition has taken out seven members of the ISIL Senior Shura – including ISIL’s Minister of War, Omar al-Shishani; ISIL’s Finance Minister, Hajji Iman; ISIL’s Minister of Information, Dr. Wa’il; and ISIL’s Chief of External Operations, Abu Muhamad Al-Adnani, who was one of ISIL’s most lethal leaders and was actively plotting to kill civilians abroad.  We also removed key ISIL leaders in both Libya and Afghanistan.  Wherever our local partners have advanced, we’ve taken out ISIL field commanders.  And we’ve removed from the battlefield more than 20 of ISIL’s external operators and plotters, including Jihadi John and Junaid Hussein, among others. Beyond key ISIL personnel, we’re continuing to go after key ISIL capabilities, including its attempts to develop chemical weapons.  As you know, we previously captured one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, and just last week, in one of the single largest airstrikes of our campaign, we destroyed a former pharmaceutical facility near Mosul that ISIL tried to use as a chemical weapons plant.  Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to aggressively attack the economic infrastructure that ISIL uses to fund its operations – from oil wells and tanker trucks to cash storage sites and key financial centers.   And we continue to take the fight to ISIL across every domain, including cyber. All of this together underscores how we are putting ISIL on the path to a lasting defeat in Iraq and Syria.  And we are now launching a decisive phase of our campaign, as the plays we’re currently executing culminate in the isolation and collapse of ISIL’s control over Raqqa and Mosul. Now, we aren’t yet releasing the full operational details of these plays in public.  That’s because – as I told troops from the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg in July before they deployed to lead our operations in Iraq and Syria under the command of Lieutenant General Steve Townsend – we don’t want the enemy to know too much about what we’re doing, what we’re thinking, and where we’re going and when.  But I do want to broadly describe the basic elements to you, as I did with our troops in July. In Syria, operations are focused on shutting down the last remaining paths for ISIL fighters to move into and out of that country – particularly when it comes to their external operators – and then on generating forces and preparing them for the envelopment of Raqqa.  We’re seeking to expand on recent gains of our local, capable partners in Manbij City, along the Mar’a Line, and elsewhere in Northern Syria to help them ensure ISIL cannot control that key terrain.  And in addition, we will aggressively pursue opportunities to build pressure on ISIL in Syria from the south, complementing our existing robust efforts from northeastern Syria. In Iraq, our actions in the western part of the country are focused on enabling the ISF to pursue mopping-up operations along the Euphrates River Valley – in order to clear the remaining pockets of ISIL presence, push the ISIL threat farther away from Baghdad, and help the government of Iraq reassert not only full control over its borders, but also control over some of its main lines of communications.  In the north, we’re continuing to help the ISF clear the remaining pockets of ISIL control along the Tigris River Valley leading up to Mosul.  And we’ve been helping the ISF and Kurdish Peshmerga to refit and generate the forces and logistical footprint necessary for their joint efforts to isolate and pressure Mosul, approaching from both the north and the south. Meanwhile, as this isolation and pressure on Raqqa and Mosul continues to build from the outside in, our partners will continue to reach deep inside those cities to pressure ISIL from the inside out. It’s already becoming clear that with the simultaneity of operations and pressure coalition forces are applying across Iraq and Syria, ISIL will simply no longer be able to resist.  And while ISIL is still a dangerous adversary and its lasting defeat will take time, we will continue to gather momentum until ISIL is defeated. Finally, with respect to the Syrian civil war, I commend Secretary Kerry for working so tirelessly to seek an arrangement which, if implemented, would ease the suffering of the Syrian people and get Russia pushing for a political transition, which is the only way to end the Syrian civil war.  There remains a ways to go to see if the terms of that arrangement will be implemented – unfortunately the behavior we’ve seen from Russia and Syria over the last few days is deeply problematic. Combatting ISIL’s Metastases This brings me to the results in our campaign’s second objective, combatting ISIL’s metastases everywhere they appear around the world – particularly in Libya and Afghanistan.  I will address these in turn. A few months ago, Chairman Dunford and I expressed concern that if left untended, Libya could be the next ISIL headquarters, as ISIL’s control over the city of Sirte was seen as their contingency plan for where they would go when they lost Raqqa and Mosul.  But because the President authorized us to act, ISIL is now under tremendous pressure there, with its territory in Sirte reduced to a single square kilometer.  Indeed, after some 50 days of supporting capable, motivated local forces fighting ISIL in its safe haven of Sirte, coalition operations – including with airstrikes at the request of Libyan Government of National Accord Prime Minister Sarraj – have shrunk ISIL’s territory to a single neighborhood.  I’m confident ISIL will be ejected from Sirte, and that we will keep looking for opportunities to combat ISIL in Libya; however, it is important to note that these are the military results.  As we’ve known from the beginning, political progress will have to follow, including reconciliation, to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat in Libya. Let me now turn to Afghanistan, where we continue to counter terrorists – both ISIL and al-Qaeda – as well as help support and strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which has the lead in fighting the Taliban and other terrorists within Afghanistan’s borders. Working with our Afghan partners, we conducted a large operation against ISIL in Afghanistan over the last two months – dealing it severe blows, including killing its top leader, Hafiz Sayed Khan, and 11 other ISIL leaders, as well as degrading the organization’s infrastructure, logistics base, and recruiting.  There will be more to come in short order. Meanwhile, more broadly, the U.S. military continues to execute its two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and helping train, advise, and assist the ANDSF as part of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission.  As you know, President Obama approved our requests earlier this year to retain a more substantial U.S. force presence into 2017, to enhance the authorities of our ground commanders, and to maintain our financial commitment to the ANDSF through 2020.  This will lead to positive effects.  Indeed, while challenges remain – including political challenges – we’re increasingly seeing the ANDSF undertake unilateral missions against ISIL and other targets on their own accord, with U.S.-provided equipment. Helping Protect our Homeland and our People Meanwhile, DoD continues to provide strong support to our partners in the FBI, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community, and state and local law enforcement to help protect our homeland and our people.  This is the number-one mission of our Northern Command.  And here the U.S. military is supporting our partners in three critical ways. First, we’re ensuring the force protection for our troops and the DoD facilities where they work and reside – both on base, and the thousands of off-base installations we operate.  Last summer’s tragedy in Chattanooga underscored how ISIL seeks to target U.S. troops and DoD civilians, which is why we’re putting in place stronger physical security systems, including stronger entry controls, better alarm systems, reinforced doors, additional ways to safely exit our facilities, and more.  And we continue to look for more ways to improve and strengthen our force protection. Second, we’re disrupting ISIL’s external operations and its ability to conduct such operations.  As I discussed earlier, our operations to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor directly support this effort, where we’ve removed dozens of ISIL external operators from the battlefield – including, as I mentioned earlier in this testimony, ISIL’s Chief of External Operations, Abu Muhamad Al-Adnani.  We have entrusted this aspect of our campaign to one of DoD’s most lethal, capable, and experienced commands, our Joint Special Operations Command, which helped deliver justice not only to Osama Bin Laden, but also to the man who founded the organization that became ISIL, Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi. Third, we’re also disrupting the flow of foreign fighters both to and from Iraq and Syria.  Here, as I discussed earlier, we’ve not only been supporting capable, motivated local forces in Syria that have retaken cities that were key transit hubs for foreign fighters in northern Syria, but we’ve also been supporting Turkish military operations intended to seal the border with Syria and prevent foreign fighters from exploiting that border to conduct attacks against our European allies and our homeland.  In recent months especially, our support of these operations has allowed us to gain new intelligence insights into ISIL’s networks of foreign fighters – networks we are determined to destroy.  In addition, we’ve worked with our coalition partners in a standing task force located in the region that looks at publically-available information and cross-checks it against our government’s various databases to identify potential ISIL cells and foreign fighter facilitation networks.  This is part of a broader effort within our coalition to not only stem the flow of foreign fighters, but also to counter ISIL’s online messaging, recruitment, and the spread of its loathsome ideology. Going Forward in the Counter-ISIL Campaign Looking to the future, the collapse of ISIL’s control over Raqqa and Mosul – which we’re confident our coalition will achieve – will put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat.  But, even when the coalition wins this fight – and let there be no doubt that we will – there will still be much more to do.  There will be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Political challenges will remain.  So when that time comes, the international community must ensure that the Iraqi and Syrian people have what they need to hold, stabilize, and govern their own territory.  For that reason, the international coalition’s humanitarian, stabilization, and governance efforts cannot be allowed to lag behind our military progress. Additionally, we must ensure that ISIL isn’t able to take root in other parts of Iraq, and that the ISF and the Peshmerga are able to sustain the gains we’ve made with them.  Such progress is critical to making our partners’ gains enduring, and ensuring that ISIL, once defeated, stays defeated. Truly delivering ISIL a lasting defeat requires both strategic patience and strategic persistence.  Even when ISIL is defeated militarily, our coalition will still have work to do.  We can’t predict what will come afterward, so we must be ready for anything – including for any attempts by ISIL to remain relevant, even if only on the darkest corners of the Internet.  And we will continue to support our law enforcement, homeland security, and intelligence partners in helping protect our homeland and our people.  How Congress Can Help – Avoiding the Biggest Strategic Dangers to Defense Let me now turn to some issues that we in DoD face as an institution – not only in addressing the challenge posed by ISIL, but in addressing all of the five challenges I mentioned earlier, and ensuring our military’s continued unrivaled breadth and strength into the future – and how you can help. These issues are grave concerns to us that we see manifested in processes here in Congress, and they are threefold: the first is budget gridlock and instability; the second, micromanagement and over-regulation; and the third concern is the continued denial of needed reforms.  Instead of these, we need budget stability achieved through bipartisanship.  We need relief from over-regulation and micromanagement.  And we need more regard and respect for the considered judgment of DoD’s most senior military and civilian leaders. As you’ve heard from me and DoD senior leaders in meetings, messages, and conversations, these are serious concerns.  I could spend a lot of time focusing on each one, and I look forward to doing so when you return in November to work on passing an NDAA – hopefully one the President can sign.  But here, at this hearing, I want to focus on the first concern, since the fiscal year ends in eight days. Avoiding Budget Instability and Gridlock We need Congress to come together around providing normal, stable, responsible budgets – that is, appropriations – because lack of stability represents one of the single biggest strategic risks to our DoD enterprise.  I’ve been talking to you for over a year and a half about the major risks posed by budget instability.  That was why I supported last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, and why DoD’s budget for FY 2017 reflected that deal.  Now the time has come to begin that fiscal year, and I can only tell you the same thing:  that budget instability is the greatest risk we face.  You heard the same from our Service Chiefs last week. Such instability is exactly the kind of dysfunction that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars – often in ways taxpayers can’t even see.  It makes planning for the fight extremely difficult for our warfighters and commanders, including in our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  It baffles our friends, and emboldens foes.  It’s managerially and strategically unsound, not to mention unfairly dispiriting to our troops and their families, and our workforce – all of whom deserve better, and deserve more predictability, to say the least.  Not only our people; our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans to be as efficient and cutting-edge as we need them to be.  And even with the modicum of stability we got in last fall’s budget deal, we still face the greatest risk of all to DoD in the eyes of all of us in the leadership – a return to sequestration funding levels, with $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts beginning next year if this isn’t fixed.  Those cuts, as you heard last week, are a major concern for our Service Chiefs, and for me as well.  And I am concerned that the gimmickry we are seeing around defense funding this year will invite the return of sequestration rather than make it less likely – because it signals that bipartisan compromises are not respected. We’re now eight days away from the end of the fiscal year, but instead of stability, we’re going into FY 2017 with yet another continuing resolution (CR).  This will be the eighth fiscal year in a row that’s started with a continuing resolution.  That’s a deplorable state of affairs in itself, as this committee has made clear – and Chairman McCain, I appreciate your comments to our Service Chiefs about the damage a CR does to our institution, as I appreciate that this committee has been among the leaders in advocating for both the resources needed for defense and the timely appropriations we need to execute our mission. As you know and as you heard from the Chiefs last week, the longer a continuing resolution lasts, the more damaging it is – it makes the obvious mistake of having us do this year exactly what we did last year, despite the fact that we’re trying to evolve and innovate to stay ahead in a changing world.  It’s not just a matter of money, but where the dollars are.  For example, even a short-term CR slows our shipbuilding program, which is line appropriated, thereby preventing the Navy from moving forward on key programs and capabilities.  And it gets worse after three months – for example, the FY 2017 defense budget quadrupled funding for our European Reassurance Initiative in order to help deter Russian aggression, but a continuing resolution extending past December would undermine our ability to build up prepositioned stocks of equipment and warfighting gear in the countries of our NATO allies.  That would have great strategic consequences. If that weren’t enough, the risk of instability is only half my concern for DoD’s budget – the other is that our budget stability is also being subjected to risk through diversions of funds. As you know, last fall’s bipartisan budget deal set the size of our budget for FY 2017.  While there was a difference between what we got in the budget deal and what we had proposed in the year prior, we determined we could mitigate that difference and still meet our needs, so we accordingly submitted our defense budget to reflect the bipartisan budget deal.  Within a matter of months, however, some in Congress reintroduced instability by departing from the bipartisan budget deal and trying to come up with ways to go around it.  I cannot support these approaches, and I’d like to tell you why. In the first approach, the House is diverting $18 billion from our overseas operations funds at a time when we have troops deployed in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and using the money for things DoD didn’t ask for and in many cases cannot afford to maintain and keep ready over time.  To do this – diverting warfighting funds at a time of war – is highly objectionable.  It harms the readiness of our troops in order to buy more force structure that we can’t afford to keep ready in the first place.  It could overtax DoD by up to $30 billion over the next five years, at the same time that we may be facing $100 billion in sequestration cuts.  It risks exacerbating our readiness challenges and creating hollow force structure.  And it threatens to unravel last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, again raising the specter of sequestration. If this is allowed to happen, there is no way I can tell a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who’s accelerating ISIL’s lasting defeat or deterring Russian aggression that we’re doing all we can for them here in Washington.  Not when Congress can’t pass timely appropriations.  And certainly not when Congress diverts defense dollars from what should be inviolable:  American troops deployed in harm’s way.  Those troops need to know that they’re getting every resource they need to accomplish their mission.  To take away from them goes too far – especially when emerging operational demands may soon require more resources than DoD initially budgeted for, not less. The backers of the House approach say they’re doing it to help our readiness, but it would actually have the opposite effect on readiness.  As you heard from the Service Chiefs last week and as you heard from me earlier in this testimony, nothing is more important to us than readiness, which is why it was the highest priority we had in preparing the 2017 defense budget – partly to rebuild full-spectrum readiness after 15 years of counterinsurgency operations, and partly to restore damage done to readiness over the last several years that was caused by the effects of sequestration cuts.  As the Chiefs made clear to you, the problems we’re fixing are different in each service – the Army needs time to put soldiers through full-spectrum brigade-level training rotations at its Combat Training Centers; for the Marine Corps, the issue is principally restoring readiness in aviation; for the Navy, it’s ship depot maintenance; and for the Air Force, it’s about maintaining readiness while remaining at a high operational tempo.  Each of these shows how restoring readiness is not just about money; it also requires time, which the Chiefs told you as well.  And all of this underscores why what the House seeks to do would actually hurt readiness:  because it risks the stability provided by last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, and it would actually give us higher end-strength for one year – that is, more people – whom we cannot afford to keep ready in the long-term. Others in Congress took a different approach, but I cannot support theirs either.  In this case, one of the defense appropriations committees cut high-priority investments that we should be making in high-end capabilities, and then spent more money on lower-priority things we didn’t ask for and already have enough of. While these cuts are less than $18 billion and do not take away from our warfighting funds, they still add up in ways that could seriously imperil our future strength.  For example, this committee chose to gut funding for undersea drones – crippling our efforts to leverage unmanned technology to ensure our forces’ global freedom of action and delivery of new payloads despite other nations’ attempts to deny access to certain operating areas.  They cut proven programs like the submarine-hunting P-8, a maritime patrol aircraft that prevents adversaries from using modern undersea technologies against us.  They made significant cuts to some of our highest-priority electronic warfare systems, the Next-Generation Jammer and the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program – handicapping our planes’ future airborne electronic attack capabilities, and leaving our surface ships more vulnerable to advanced missile threats.  They cut the critical core out of advanced munitions programs needed to increase our Navy’s lethality – both the maritime-strike version of the Tomahawk  cruise missile, and the new, highly-lethal anti-ship mode for one of our most modern and capable munitions, the SM-6  missile.  And on top of that, committees in both the House and Senate made cuts to critical defense innovation spearheads that we need to maintain our military’s technological edge and counter some of the most vexing threats we face – taking away funding from our Strategic Capabilities Office, our partnership with In-Q-Tel, and our tech startup, the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx). Now, I don’t believe there was ill-will here, but these were cuts to investments highly prioritized by DoD’s senior military and civilian leaders, substituting lower-priority spending we didn’t ask for.  And we oppose each of them, because they undermine our preparations to counter and stay ahead of our competitors’ technological advances.  I’ve seen the constant temptation over the years to starve new and future-oriented defense investments in favor of more established and therefore well-entrenched programs.  In a rapidly changing and competitive world, we must resist this temptation. Rather than funding these investments in lethality and innovation that were among our highest priorities for sharpening our military edge and staying ahead of our adversaries, Congress wants instead to buy things like an extra Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), which we didn’t request.  These ships have important uses, but we already bought 26, with 14 more on the way, and we do not need more.  We have much greater needs:  we need the undersea drones, advanced munitions, electronic warfare capabilities, P-8s, and innovation initiatives these measures would cut. Of course, there are other proposals which again do not comport with last fall’s bipartisan budget deal.  Having rejected the two approaches I just discussed, I also have to say – as you’ve heard me emphasize for the last year and a half – that I cannot support any third approach that moves us toward sequestration, or that moves us away from bipartisanship.  Not at the expense of budget stability.  Not if it shortchanges the needs of our warfighters.  Not if it means funding lower priorities instead of higher priorities.  Not if it undermines confidence in the ability to pass bipartisan budget deals, which could lead to the imposition of sequestration’s $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts.  And not if it adds extra force structure that we cannot afford to keep ready in the long-term and that would only lead to a hollow force.  Conclusion – The Need for Bipartisan Budget Stability I appreciate that this committee didn’t follow either of those two approaches, but as conference negotiations continue, I must emphasize that what we need most is stability – it’s critical in order for DoD and our people to address all the national security challenges we face. I am confident, and hopeful, that we can come back together again.  Today, America is fortunate to have the world’s strongest, most capable, most innovative military.  I know it, you know it, our friends and allies know it, and critically, our potential adversaries know it too.  Only with your help can we ensure that my successors can say the same, and that what is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known remains that way for years and generations to come. Thank you.

"Aug. 26, 2015","Let’s just pause a moment before we get started. Look at this magnificent day, look at this magnificence in front of us, you all who stand here so proudly, and represent the wonderful, wonderful men and women who protect this country, what a magnificent sight. And we’re so, so proud of you. What a wonderful sight that is. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, elected officials, leaders of the Defense Department, colleagues, I’m honored to be with you today as one of our finest military leaders, General Darren McDew, assumes this critically important command. Before I speak to General McDew’s remarkable leadership or the work of this remarkable command, I want to offer my appreciation to Vice Admiral Andy Brown, who’s held down the fort here…where is he…there you are…who’s held down the fort here since General Selva joined us at the Pentagon. He probably didn’t know what he was in for, but Admiral Brown has done such a good job that I decided to make him the J4 back there. Now, I’m not really sure he wants to come from here to there, but we’re going to be very glad to have him. And of course, we’ve come here today to mark a pivotal moment in the long and distinguished career of one our most accomplished military leaders, General Darren McDew. From his earliest years – from teachers who told him they were sure he would make a difference, to leaders at the Virginia Military Institute who named him Regimental Commander – General McDew has been recognized by others for his commitment to serve. And for more than three decades in the Air Force, whether at the squadron, wing, or group wing level, General McDew has stood out for his uncommon ability to lead. General McDew brings to this command an understanding of military logistics from the inside out. He’s a tested operator who’s logged more than 3,000 hours on tankers, C-17s, and C-130s. He’s delivered critical supplies to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines on several continents. What’s more, serving as a military aide to the President and as Vice Director of Strategic Plans at the Pentagon, he developed a keen strategic understanding of the judicious and effective use of American power. But those who have served alongside General McDew or under his command may understand best what sets him apart. That’s his commitment to the enrichment and development of our military’s most valuable asset, our people. General McDew says that so much of his wisdom and strength comes from what he calls his “better 98%,” his wife Evelyn, who’s here today – I have one of those too, it’s more like 99.1% in my case. General McDew has described Evelyn as his foundation, as his source of inspiration, as the person who keeps him attuned to what truly matters most: family and country, service and sacrifice. These are the values that Darren and Evelyn have passed down to their own family, to their daughter Keisha, and their son, Keith, who serves as a Lieutenant Commander in the Coast Guard. Keith, I might add, is also the proud father on Darren’s first grandchild, Henry, who made his first plane trip to be with us today. There’s Henry over there in the sunglasses. As General McDew assumes this vital command, he follows in the footsteps of another proven strategic mind, General Paul Selva. That the President has nominated some of our most distinguished military leaders to assume this command speaks volumes about the vital importance of TRANSCOM and its people. While the men and women of TRANSCOM do not often receive the recognition they deserve, truly they are the foundation of everything we do. You provide our force the flexibility and mobility to confront any threat, in any place, for the purpose of our choosing. Much of TRANSCOM’s strength comes from its ability to evolve and adapt, to respond quickly to new challenges and meet new demands. I saw that firsthand in the support we provided for our men and women in Afghanistan when I directed the Department’s acquisition, technology, and logistics efforts. As many of you know very well, Afghanistan is some of the most forbidding terrain imaginable. It is one of the most difficult places in the world to plan and wage a war. And yet, we were able to surge forces and build hundreds of FOBs and COPs during a period of heated conflict. I used to call this the Afghanistan miracle – but meeting tomorrow’s challenges will require another logistical miracle. Preparing to meet threats from our high-end adversaries will require major logistical lift. Already, TRANSCOM has improved its capacity to track deliveries in real time and predict with greater accuracy the arrival of shipments. These reforms have allowed our forces in the field to plan more effectively and efficiently, and have helped to bring costs down. TRANSCOM has also strengthened and streamlined its efforts with private sector providers. And today, there is no other part of our military enterprise that is more effectively augmented by commercial industry – and to those partners here today, thank you for being part of the team. By finding new ways to use existing commercial infrastructure, and by spurring greater competition among private sector partners, TRANSCOM continues to make our operations more cost-effective. TRANSCOM’s commitment to expand these reforms remains vitally important, because as we deliver for the warfighter, we have an obligation to deliver value for the taxpayer as well. When the men and women of TRANSCOM continue to meet these dual commitments, it’s much easier for me to make a full-throated argument in Washington for greater investment in our people and capabilities. In the next few weeks I’ll be talking quite a bit about the critical need for future investments in our force, the need to get a budget from Congress that charts a responsible course and invests in you. As distant as these conversations in Washington may appear to what’s happening in Southern Illinois, this is a discussion that matters deeply to TRANSCOM, to Belleville, Illinois, and to our entire country. If we can’t come together and pass a sensible budget, if we’re forced to operate under a continuing resolution, or to endure another bout of sequestration, there will be real consequences. And TRANSCOM will feel them firsthand. Because when we’re forced to make irresponsible cuts, it’s readiness that suffers first. When we’re forced to budget one year at a time, it’s investment in the future and modernization that gets sacrificed. What you’re able to deliver so quickly and consistently can seem like magic to outsiders. But you know, and your families know, that it only happens because of the thousands of Americans within this Command who remain absolutely devoted to our mission. When every day you do what it takes to deliver for our warfighters, Washington needs to deliver a responsible future budget for you. Just think for a moment about some of what you’ve accomplished in a little more than a year. It was the men and women of TRANSCOM who enabled the United States to lead a global effort to contain Ebola in West Africa. It was the men and women of TRANSCOM who allowed the United States to provide urgent relief to Yazidis on Mount Sinjar, helping save some 20,000 lives. And it was because of the men and women of TRANSCOM, that when an earthquake struck Nepal, we could deliver 70,000 pounds of supplies for rescue operations in less than 24-hours. With these missions, and through countless others that receive far less fanfare, you ensure that American power and the power of our example can reach anywhere, and is seen everywhere. None of us know when the United States will have to respond quickly to even greater crises in the coming months or where your capabilities will be needed to save lives, defend our country, and make a better world. But this we do know: We know General McDew will lead this Command with confidence and certainty and with the total confidence of me and the President. We know the people of TRANSCOM will carry forward a steadfast commitment to deliver what our force requires, whenever, wherever they require it. We know that it is because of these capabilities and your contributions that we remain the military force the world has ever known. Thank you.

"Sept. 25, 2015","Pause a moment, all of us, pause and behold this sight in front of you – so magnificent, so proud. They, out on that field, represent the millions of men and women who make America’s military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. President Obama, so many distinguished guests and elected officials: your presence with us here today signifies the awesome responsibility reposed in the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which we are about to transfer from General Marty Dempsey to General Joe Dunford. The current Chairman shares with me the duty to love and respect those who defend this country; to advise the Commander in Chief with candor, carry out his orders with excellence, and share just a bit of the enormous weight he bears; and to help this great nation to make a better world. Marty Dempsey was nominated to be Chairman at the same time I was nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Defense.  He and Deanie, and Stephanie and I, sat down for dinner together and talked about what we wanted to accomplish, and how we wanted to conduct ourselves.  In him I saw the dedication to hard work, devotion to the force and the country, and the civility to all, that I hoped to have. Marty had already shown all these traits and more for 37 long years of service.  He had led the 1st Armored Division during difficult days, returned to reconstitute the Iraqi Army, and had been Chief of Staff of the Army. Three and a half years later, I became Secretary of Defense and once again turned to Marty for inspiration and brotherhood.  There is so much I could say about what Marty has done to make sure tomorrow’s force is as superb as today’s, to drive forward in new domains like cyber, space, and to manage as well as possible through unconscionable budget turbulence. But since President Obama is present, I would like to alight for a moment upon the benefit I immediately observed Marty bringing to the President’s decision making.  In the Situation Room, all listened attentively when Marty offered his advice from the military leadership. As a physicist by training, I’m partial to one way Marty describes leadership.  The challenge is not unlike Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Marty has often said: “When you touch it, you change it.” Now I’m not going to quibble with Marty’s physics here, but I’m certain he’s exactly right about this:  Every decision a military leader makes, large or small, touches the lives of our troops; it touches the lives of countless families; it changes the nature of our world and the destiny of our country.  For men and women who operate every day during a time of rapid change and uncertainty, this is the constant weight and responsibility of leadership. In those councils, Marty Dempsey speaks with the concision of the English student he once was, and invariably with a little of the sparkle of the Irishman he will always be.  He has lived by the words of his favorite Irish poet, W.B. Yeats, that: “Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than before.” I’m confident in telling you Marty: you will be missed. Marty has also said the best leaders make us want to be better versions of who we are.  And of course, we know one remarkable woman who has done that for Marty, and that’s his wife Deanie.  So when Marty heard, for example, Time Magazine named him one of the world’s most influential people, it caught him by surprise.  He said he didn’t know he was even the most influential person in his family. Marty and Deanie make a wonderful team.  Over the years, no one has attended more memorials, wakes, or weddings.  For the Dempseys: There are truly no strangers in our military family, to quote Yeats yet again: “There are only friends they haven’t met.” So Deanie, we thank you for finding Marty during your days at Goshen High School.  And for sharing with him the blessings of three children – all of whom answered the call to serve – and no fewer than nine grandchildren. An Irishman indeed. Now on to the other Irishman: Joe Dunford.  Since, not all of you were able to be present yesterday at the Marine Barracks, when we retired Joe Dunford from the job every Marine considers the best job in the military – Commandant of the Marine Corps – it bears repeating.  But first and foremost to Ellyn. Ellyn has been Joe’s rock-solid foundation for more than three decades.  Her support for military families and wounded warriors is much more than dutiful – it is personal.  The rest of Joe’s family – three children, Joseph, Pat, and Kathleen – and parents Mr. and Mrs. Dunford – have supported Joe and Ellyn in providing that warm support. And I want to give Ellyn a special word of appreciation, and here’s why: She was just settling in joyfully to her duties as the Commandant’s wife, and enjoying having Joe home from Afghanistan, when a different calling came.  Joe was the clear choice to be the President’s next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but he wasn’t Ellyn’s.  Ellyn, thanks from all of us for going one more measure of devotion. Now, to why Joe is the right man for the job.  Joe Dunford is the kind of officer Marines want to follow – in the early years of the Iraq War, Joe commanded the 5th Marine Regiment.  Joe refused armor inserts in his flack-jacket until every Marine under his command was already issued a pair. That story says more than any of us ever could about the character and leadership of this great man. Humble. Strong. Centered. Always faithful to his people and mission … wielding the operational acuity of a battle hardened commander and the strategic wisdom of a statesman. We saw that clearly during Joe’s time leading U.S. and allied troops as the NATO ISAF Commander: we saw his compassion in handwritten condolences sent to families of the fallen…we saw his tenacity in the way he managed dealing with President Karzai…and we saw his skillfulness in transitioning security responsibility to Afghan Forces. During that time, all that time, and over the past 14 years, in two complex, all-consuming wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our Marines and all our Service Members performed spectacularly. Today, the Marine Corps is at the center of a great strategic transition in our military:  emerging from 15 years of counterinsurgency and strength in presence…to preparing for a full spectrum of threats, where we remain overwhelmingly strong in posture, and not only presence. In a way – that’s what Marines have always done.  Answering the call across the full range of military operations.  No one understands that better than Joe. As the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Joe answers the President’s call.  Joe will provide him critical counsel and serve as a critical bridge, between military and civilian leadership, and also between two administrations, between 14 years of war and a time of strategic transition for our force. Once again, we thank Ellyn and their family for sharing Joe with our country. The Chairman will soon change, but the quality of counsel he provides the President and the caliber of their leadership will endure. The characteristics that Marty and Joe so excellently demonstrate: flexibility and creativity – the ability to act courageously and decisively – these are the attributes of our greatest leaders.  These are the qualities they share with our Commander in Chief.  So as we say farewell to Marty and welcome Joe as Chairman, we also thank the President for his leadership and constancy, for his deep commitment to the safety, welfare, and dignity of our men and women in uniform. The example and commitment of these three leaders has indeed made each of us nobler and stronger. And because of their unwavering service to country and commitment to our military, our nation is nobler and stronger, and will be, forever more. Thank you.

"July 4, 2016","To all of the men and women of the Department of Defense, it is an honor to join you in celebration of Independence Day. As you serve on every ship and every base, in every time zone and every domain, you uphold the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. For our nation and for so many others around the world, you protect and further the self-evident truths that we are created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These ideals are more than a pinnacle to strive for. They are the North Star that has guided every generation in the long line of patriots who have stepped forward to defend our nation since the day it was founded 240 years ago. And they are the principles that must continue to guide us every day. As Americans celebrate this important day at home and around the world, my thoughts and my gratitude are with all of you and your families. To all of you, have a happy and safe Fourth of July. May God bless you, and may God bless the great nation we defend. ",Independence Day Message,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/822831/independence-day-message/
"Sept. 14, 2016","Terrific, well, thank you both, Joe, and Bill, for being here, for that introduction, for your friendship, and for your enduring commitment to public service – first, over nearly four decades in uniform, culminating in your leadership of our Special Operations Command, and now as chancellor of the University of Texas and also a member of DoD’s, I’m pleased to say, new Defense Innovation Board.  Thanks, Bill. And thanks to everyone here at Capital Factory.  This morning, Josh – where’s Josh? There you are – Josh, thanks for being part of the inspiration of this day, appreciate it. Representatives from this community’s bright constellation of innovative businesses, universities, and government institutions: thank all of you for joining us here today. It’s great to be back here in Austin to formally announce that our technology start-up, DIUx, Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, is expanding yet again and extending the Department of Defense’s outreach to America’s technology community.  Given this city and this region’s deep commitment to innovation, and also, I should say, this state’s deep connections to those who serve, we couldn’t have picked a better place than Austin, Texas. I created DIUx last year because one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build, and in some cases to rebuild, bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and America’s wonderfully innovative and open technology community. That’s important, because we’ve had a long history of partnership – working together to develop and advance technologies like the Internet, GPS, and in the years before that, satellite communications and the jet engine.  What we’ve done together has not only benefited both our security and our society, but it’s fair to say the entire world, and that cooperation between industry, the academy, and government helped make our military what it is today: the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, there’s no one more capable, there’s no one more innovative than we.  That’s a fact, and it’s one that every American ought to be proud of. But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted in the 21st century; we have to earn it again and again.  And today, it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a changing and fiercely competitive world. Technology itself is an example of that change.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  And today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap.  And meanwhile, technologies once possessed only by the most advanced militaries have gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on things like satellites and the Internet can lead to vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. So to stay ahead of all these challenges, to stay the best, I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box – to invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds:  in our technology, in our operations, in our organizations, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force. One way we’re doing that is by pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, undersea drones – much, much more.  We’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed will invest $72 billion in research and development next year alone.  And that’s more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google spent on R&D last year, combined.  So it’s a big investment. Another way we’re investing in innovation is through people, to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young Americans for our force of the future.  As part of that, we’re building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or for a project.  It will also allow more of DoD’s and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – and I should remind you that there are many of them – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovation ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about working with defense. Now, innovative technologies and people are necessary, and that’s why we’re building bridges to them.  But technology and people also need innovative practices and organizational structures, so we’re investing in them, too.  The world we live in demands it.  While the Cold War was characterized by the slow and steady accumulation of strength, with the leaders simply having more, bigger, and better weapons, today’s era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can innovate faster than anyone else.  And it’s no longer just a matter of the level of the technology we buy.  More than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, who we buy them from, how rapidly and creatively we can adapt and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies. And to ensure that we keep adopting more innovative practices in the future, I recently created the Defense Innovation Board to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive.  It’s chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and the board members we’re recruiting represent a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, and also, as I mentioned earlier, Austin’s very own Bill McRaven.  I’ve charged Bill and the rest of the Defense Innovation Board to keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people and organizations and operations and technology – to support innovators themselves, the people in DoD and the strong companies that already work with us who are willing to try new things, who are willing to fail, fail fast, and to iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead in this changing and competitive world. At the outset, I’ve given them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in the Department of Defense, not unlike our recent Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which you may have heard of, which invited white-hat hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already conduct.  So while this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful we’re expanding it to other parts of DoD.  It’s the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Defense Innovation Board – things that are out there that we might be able to use. Now, of course, not everything in the private sector is going to make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way that others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror.  It doesn’t mean we can’t look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn for ways we can operate more effectively.  So the board will recommend a first slate of innovative practices in the fall, in time for me to review and determine which ones make sense for us to adopt.  And I have no doubt that we will. Finally, one more way we’re investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector across America’s many great innovation hubs, unrivaled in the world – places like Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and of course, here in Austin. And that’s why we, and DIUx, have come here today. Over the last 12 months, since we first opened the doors of the west coast office in Silicon Valley, DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the tech community.  And it’s been enormously productive. We’ve already iterated – launching DIUx 2.0, as we call it, in May, under the leadership of Raj Shah and his fellow partners.  We’ve expanded to Boston, where I opened the DIUx east coast office in July.  And Raj and his team are already bringing in game-changing technologies that are going to benefit America’s warfighters.  They’ve closed five deals just in the last three months.  It took an average of just over 50 days after they first interacted with a company to award these funds.  That’s fast, especially for the Department of Defense, and appropriately so.  And they have another 22 more projects already in the pipeline for an additional $65 million, in areas like network defense, autonomous seafaring drones, and virtual war-gaming. Today, we’re building on that progress with a new DIUx presence here in Austin, to join and complement our east and west coast operations. Coming here made perfect sense.  The “Silicon Hills” of central Texas have long been a hotbed of scientific and technological innovation – from the garage inventors and dorm room entrepreneurs who follow in Michael Dell’s footsteps, to the startups nurtured in incubators like Capital Factory right here, to the researchers and grad students breaking new ground on campus at U.T. But this is also a state with deep connections to the Department of Defense and to our mission of defending our country and our people.  Texas is home to over a dozen military bases, including some of our largest and most populous, like Fort Bliss and Fort Hood.  Texas is also where some of our longstanding and highly innovative defense companies are located – manufacturing key platforms like the Marine Corps’ most modern attack and utility helicopters, the AH-1 Zulu, and the UH-1 Yankee – Venom, so-called – as well as our most advanced stealth fighter, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the Army’s High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which I’ll remind you we’re using more and more in our coalition campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat in Syria and Iraq, which we surely will do.  Texas is also the home of many service members, military families, and veterans.  In fact, Texas has one of the highest numbers of veteran-owned businesses in the country, including dozens of start-ups right here in Austin. So bringing DIUx to central Texas and to Austin was a logical step for us.  And we’re fortunate there are two important organizations here – institutions, really – that can help us get established in the area.  One is right here, Capital Factory, where DIUx personnel will start off by working part-time from the co-working spaces here – hopefully benefiting from the close proximity to Austin’s “center of gravity” for innovators.  And the other institution is the University of Texas, which of course has given rise to generations of inventors and innovations in advanced computing, data visualization, robotics, energy, engineering and design, and more. One thing that’s unique about our presence in Austin is that it will help expand DIUx’s national reserve element, which is led by Navy Reserve Commander Doug Beck, a decorated combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Doug’s a very busy guy, especially right now – in his civilian life, he’s a vice president for Apple, reports directly to Tim Cook – but I’m grateful he could join us here today, and for his continued leadership in the DIUx west coast office. From there, Doug’s been leading a great team of citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, all of whom provide unique value to DIUx since many of these patriots are tech industry leaders and entrepreneurs when they’re not on duty for us – for DoD. We’re looking to benefit from such talent even more in Austin, because here, DIUx will build its ranks by recruiting proven local innovators who already serve our country in the National Guard and the Reserves.  Once they come on board, they’ll serve part-time – that is, in their regular Reserve capacity – to help connect the broader DIUx enterprise with local and nearby companies that are developing promising technologies with potential customers across our Department of Defense.  They’ll work in close coordination with the DIUx partners based in Silicon Valley and in Boston.  And if this model continues to succeed, we are going to look to replicate it in other innovation hubs around the country.  The “x” in DIUx is well past proving itself as an experiment, but it won’t stop experimenting. Now, to help us get this new DIUx outpost up and running, I’ve hand-picked a leader who was recently one of DoD’s most creative and talented senior civilians – Christine Abizaid.  Christy Abizaid, right over there.  I asked Christy to be our point-person here not only because of her proud legacy of service to our country, but because she has proven to be an innovative thinker and innovative leader everywhere she goes.  In the Pentagon, at the White House, and on battlefields halfway around the world, Christy has always been looking for better, smarter, faster ways to get things done.  Until just recently, Christy was our Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia – lovely places – serving as one of my most trusted policy advisers for what you’ll all recognize as a critically important region.  And I know she’ll do a great job spearheading DIUx’s presence in Austin. And joining Christy will be local Reserve members, starting with First Lieutenant Samantha Snabes, right there.  Before joining DIUx, Samantha’s been serving in uniform as an intelligence officer in the Mississippi Air National Guard.  In civilian life, she’s co-founder and CEO of re:3D, a business she started here in Austin to support affordable, industrial 3-D printing innovations.  Lieutenant Snabes has also worked at NASA and with DARPA – a great example of the innovative people we already have in our military’s ranks.  And I’m sure more Austin-based reservists like her will be joining DIUx soon. And before you know, Christy and her team will be reaching out to all of you here.  They’ll want you to help them understand the technologies you’re working on.  They’ll want to help you understand how those technologies can support our men and women in uniform and contribute to defending our country.  You tell us what you’re doing, we’ll tell you how it can help.  They’ll be our ambassadors to you and a way for you to connect back to us.  So I hope you take the time to get to know them, and even better, to work with them. This is a very exciting and portentous time.  For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on with us, and that’s also true for those interested in technology.  But the intersection of those two – what matters and what’s new – is an opportunity-rich environment. Let me explain what I mean by that, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face. Right now – right now, as we sit here in this room – our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our world-wide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate a lasting defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do and we want to do soon.  They’re training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re also sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula, countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East, and all the while, they’re helping protect our people here at home and helping to make a better world for our children. In each of these missions, you and technologists like you can make a difference, too.  Because whether it’s machine-learning technology that might be able to recognize and block ISIL’s barbaric ideology on social media, or algorithms to help a self-driving boat track submarines, or biotech research that could one day help our troops recover from injury faster, technology’s a critical part of everything we do – and it’s critical to addressing every challenge we face today. I want to close by saying that I know many of you in this city take pride in keeping Austin weird.  So let me assure you, I not only want to keep Austin weird; I’m counting on it.  Because the creative thinking that happens in places like Austin is part of what makes our country so innovative and our economy so vibrant and strong.  And I know that with DIUx in town, it’ll also help our military remain the best in the world. Because when it comes to America’s national security, we can’t afford to be complacent.  Our competitors are trying to out-innovate us, which means we have to be willing to think a little differently.  That’s how we’ve succeeded in the past – thinking differently put us in space, it put us on the moon, it put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips – and it’s how we’ll succeed and prevail in the future, too: ensuring the safety of our country and our fellow citizens for generations to come. That’s why DIUx matters.  It has to do with our protection and our security, and creating a world where people can live their lives, dream their dreams, and give their children a better future. Contributing to that mission – helping to defend this great country and to make a better world – is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur, or a young person can do.  And we’re grateful to all of you here for your interest in doing that with us. Thank you. ","Remarks Announcing a DIUx Outpost in Austin, Texas",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/945066/remarks-announcing-a-diux-outpost-in-austin-texas/
"Sept. 16, 2015","Good morning. Scott, thank you for that introduction and Secretary James, General Welsh, Betty and the whole gang here. I know most of the people in this room. It’s good to be with you. We have a number of distinguished guests, elected officials, and our wonderful, wonderful airmen and the 100,000 members of AFA.  To all of you, thanks for having me here today. To you and to the nearly half a million men and women in the United States Air Force who are serving around the world on active duty, in the reserves, or National Guard, an early Happy 68th to you! I can see the strength of the Air Force in so many of its leaders and members who are here today.  I see it in Larry Spencer. Where are you, Larry? Larry, my longtime friend, who actually grew up just a few miles from where we stand today.  And throughout his career, when he enlisted in 1971, General Spencer has never forgotten where he began, or where we draw our strength from: which is from our people.  As he rose through the ranks he frequently brought enlisted members together to advise him on how to make improvements on quality of life and housing and other things.  And even today, as he helps to lead the AFA, he is still working for our wonderful people.  Thanks Larry for your dedication. In a year in which we mark the 100th anniversary of the successful use of combat aircraft, the theme of this gathering, “Reinventing the Aerospace Nation” could not be more appropriate.  Over the past century, no nation has used airpower to demonstrate its global reach – to compress time and space – like the United States.  Today, it’s vital to innovate and reinvest in the people, strategies, and technologies that will allow America’s military to be dominant in the second aerospace century. I made three commitments the day I was nominated as Secretary of Defense a few months ago, and the first is my commitment – the first and most sacred – is my commitment to the people of the current force – including active duty, guard, reservists, veterans, and their families.  And the second, is my commitment to help the President devise a national security strategy suited for the new century – protecting our country, keeping us strong, respected by our friends and feared by our enemies.  And third, is my commitment to our future and to the force of the future – where innovation and technology remain pillars of American strength, and where we continue to recruit and retain the best America has to offer. Today I’d like to talk to you about these commitments, and how the Air Force is supporting each one of them. Let me start with my first commitment, to our people, because it’s our people that make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Since Desert Storm, our Air Force has been at war.  Over that time our force has gotten leaner and our platforms have gotten older.  All the while, the men and women of our Air Force continue to provide the United States the flexibility to demonstrate the example of our power and the power of our example anywhere in the world. It’s our airmen who have conducted two-thirds of all airstrikes against ISIL since last September, enabling partners on the ground to begin to take back the territory ISIL took in Iraq last summer.  It’s our airmen we sent to Europe to take a united stand against Russian aggression with our NATO partners, deploying F-22s, spearheading a persistent and dominant air, land, and sea presence in the region.  Our strategic approach to Putin’s Russia is strong and balanced and necessitates a new playbook for the NATO alliance in which our airmen play a vital part. And whether we needed to provide immediate relief to Nepal after a horrible earthquake, or to convene a global effort to contain Ebola in West Africa, our Air Force also has helped lead the way. Now there's one young airman, Dustin Temple, who, with his actions last September, exemplified the commitment of our Air Force and what it means to our military.  Senior Airman Temple was assigned to a joint Special Forces and Afghan Commando team responsible for taking back part of the Helmand River Valley.  When blistering enemy fire suppressed his team and a sniper hit a teammate, he dragged him from a rooftop and carried him across 100 meters of open terrain. And when he reached the helicopter, the fight wasn't done yet so neither was Airman Temple or his Air Force teammates.  Hours later, when supplies began to run out, he sprinted out into the open, not once but twice to reach a supply helicopter, allowing his team to keep the enemy engaged.  All told, over 48-hours Airman Temple and his team controlled 20 fixed wing assets and 28 attack helicopters for a total of 26 engagements.  In the process, they saved the lives of 38 friendly forces. That kind of strength and resolve that Dustin Temple and his team showed is in the DNA of our airmen.   It’s been a privilege as Secretary of Defense to see their strength firsthand on visits to our bases across the country and around the world.  For our airmen, ""fight tonight"" is not just a slogan.  It's a mindset they carry with them. Wherever they serve, whatever the threat, our airmen are ready to defend one another, defend America's interests, and demonstrate our highest values. Few others know better than you: our greatest responsibility is to make sure we never put a single one of America's brave sons or daughters or their families in harm’s way without the greatest care and reflection about how it benefits our nation. And our responsibility extends to all generations – to our veterans, to our wounded warriors, to the fallen and their families, and those on the frontlines today.  We’ve made tremendous progress in recent years, and I’m grateful for the support and partnership AFA has provided to our force for nearly seven decades. My second commitment is to the President, to provide him candid strategic advice and to implement his decisions with our accustomed excellence.  Every strategic decision we make should be a step towards keeping us safe, protecting our country, and protecting our allies and friends. After a period of 14 years when our men and women in uniform performed with tremendous professionalism, skill and valor, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the force is now at the start of a critical strategic transition.  As our military adjusts its focus on counter insurgency and redoubles its full spectrum capabilities, the Air Force will play a critical role. Just take the Asia-Pacific, a region that encompasses close to half of humanity, accounts for more than half the world’s economic power, and where we are positioning the majority of the Air Force’s high-end assets.  This is part of the President’s strategic rebalance, where we are working to align our security, economic, and diplomatic investments in the region to match our vital – and growing – interests there. Our rebalance has always been about sustaining peace and prosperity across the Asia-Pacific and helping the region continue to fulfill its promise. We will preserve America's support for a regional security architecture in the Asia-Pacific that is inclusive enough, capable enough, and resilient enough to ensure that all nations – all nations – have the opportunity to continue to rise.  Here, the Air Force is playing a vital role with a stronger posture in the region, including tactical aircraft like the F-22, space and cyber forces, and ISR assets like the MQ-9, and the Global Hawk.  We will continue to strengthen and modernize our infrastructure in places like Guam and across the Pacific.  And we will continue to deepen our security cooperation with longstanding allies like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, and new partners like India and Vietnam. We will strengthen our partnerships, our presence, and posture so that the Asia Pacific is a region where everyone rises together … and so that its security architecture grows stronger, not weaker. With China, we see our relationship as defined by elements of both cooperation and competition.  Our military engagement with China seeks to build sustained and substantive dialogue, to advance concrete, practical cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and to enhance risk reduction measures to diminish the potential for miscalculation. At the same time, given our concern about China’s growing military capabilities and coercive approach to disputes, we are taking prudent steps to prepare for heightened competition. Along with many of our Pacific partners and nations across the world, the United States is deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities…to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  As a Pacific nation, a trading nation, an ally and partner to many – most actually – of the nations of the region from Japan to Australia to India, the United States will persist in its decades-long strategic approach. First, we will continue to seek a peaceful resolution of all disputes.  To that end, there should be an immediate and permanent halt to land reclamation by all claimants.  We also oppose any further militarization of disputed features.  We all know there is no military solution to the South China Sea disputes.   Right now, at this critical juncture, is the time for renewed diplomacy, focused on a finding a lasting solution that protects the rights and the interests of all.  As it is central to the regional security architecture, ASEAN must be a part of that effort. Meanwhile, the United States will continue to protect freedom of navigation and overflight – principles that have ensured security and prosperity in this region for decades.  There should be no mistake: the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as U.S. forces do all over the world.  America, alongside its allies and partners in the regional architecture, will not be deterred from exercising these rights.  After all, turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit. Finally, with its actions in the South China Sea, China is out of step with both the international rules and norms that underscore the Asia-Pacific’s security architecture, and the regional consensus that favors diplomacy and opposes coercion. These actions are spurring nations to respond together in new ways, including bilateral and multi-lateral exercises with us, joint operations with us, and the new U.S. Maritime Security Initiative. The United States will always stand with its allies and partners.  It’s important for the region to understand that America is going to remain engaged…continue to stand up for international law and universal principles…and help provide security and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come, as it has for many decades. And that brings me to my last commitment, which is to the future of our country and the great institution that I now have the privilege to lead.   To stay the best, we have to embrace the future.  And that has several dimensions.  We need a 21st century personnel system to match a 21st century military.  We have to be open to a wider world of technology. And we need a sensible long-term budget that does right by our military and our taxpayers. For our people to stay the best, we have to attract and compete for the best talent from a new generation.  We have an all-volunteer force. So for us to keep recruiting and retaining the best, the military has to continue to be recognized for what it is, which is a wonderful place to work and serve.  We’re aligning our personnel management system with 21st century trends – like the digital revolution in talent management.  We must also understand the reality that some young Americans aren’t satisfied with industrial-era career tracks. You may have read about recent proposals on personnel changes. We are thinking many ideas through and we need time to get the best ideas and advice, and especially from the armed services.  The people of the U.S. Armed Forces are the best, and always will be the best, and how we manage them should be, too. Today, we need to innovate, not only to continue to attract the best people, but to develop the next generation of capabilities.  Our technology remains the best.  At the same time, we can’t ignore the overall trend:  High-end military technologies long possessed by only the most advanced foes are finding their way into the hands of both non-state actors and previously much less-capable militaries. It’s evident that nations like Russia and China have been pursuing military modernization programs to close the technology gap with the United States.  They’re developing platforms designed to thwart our traditional advantages of power projection and freedom of movement.   They’re developing and fielding new and advanced aircraft and ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, and anti-air missiles that are longer-range and more accurate. Just as Russia and China have advanced cyber capabilities and strategies ranging from stealthy network penetration to intellectual property theft, criminal and terrorist networks are increasing their cyber operations.  Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace. From cyber, to electronic warfare, to threats in outer space and under the sea, we need to redouble our effort on those frontiers.  And just as DOD and government investment played a historic role in helping spur ground-up technology innovation in the past – from the Internet, to GPS, to Apple’s Siri – today we need to invest in new technology, new partnerships, and new innovation for this new environment. All of this – having the best people, maintaining the best technology, and executing the best strategy – takes resources. To that end, we proposed investments in key areas of the U.S. Air Force program in to support this strategy in the President’s 2016 Budget – in our nuclear deterrence forces; in space and counter-space capabilities; in counter-A2/AD platforms, systems, and technologies; in cyber capabilities; in guided munitions; and in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, systems, and technologies. I believe these remain the right areas of focus for the Air Force program in PB17, and I look forward to continuing conversations with Air Force leadership and the senior leadership of the Department about these investments.  But throughout these discussions, we ought to be clear and determined about the way forward given some real constraints we face. Time and again, our military has proven extraordinarily capable and adaptive.  And despite the decrease in defense spending since Fiscal Year 2013, the four big pillars of our national defense strategy remain sound: providing for homeland defense; having the capacity and capability to respond to multiple contingencies at the same time; conducting a global counterterrorism campaign with partners; and responding to emerging 21st century threats like cyber and space. But we also can’t ignore certain constraints on our operations and strategy.  Budget uncertainty, a decrease in defense resources, and Congressional reluctance to agree to proposed reforms – including eliminating overhead and unneeded infrastructure, retiring older platforms, and making reasonable adjustments in compensation – amount to a tax on how we plan and how we operate. If we have to carry these burdens further, it’s clear we will have to approach parts of our defense strategy differently than we have before.  I believe we should be thoughtful and direct about this.  As a Department, we will have to make changes in order to provide the best defense for our nation. Before I close, allow me to say just a few words about the immediate budget impasse we find ourselves facing right here today.  Even as we need to innovate, to continue to attract the best people, to develop the next generation of capabilities and to meet a current generation of threats, yet again – yet again we face the real risk that political gridlock will hold us back.  With only 14 days remaining in this fiscal year, Congress has yet to pass appropriations bills that will appropriately fund the government for the coming year. Without a negotiated budget solution in which everyone comes together at last, we will again return to sequestration, reducing discretionary funds to their lowest real level in a decade -- despite the fact that members of both parties agree this result will harm our national security. The alternative to a budget deal, a long-term continuing resolution, is merely sequester-level funding under another name.  And the longer a continuing resolution is, the worse it becomes, eventually resulting in a $38 billion deficit in resources for our military if Congress chooses to pursue this path for a full year. The Department of Defense has done its best to manage through budget uncertainty in recent years, making difficult choices and tradeoffs among the size, capabilities, and readiness of the joint force. But as I have discussed today, over that time Russia and China have advanced their new capabilities.  And new imperatives, such as ensuring a lasting defeat of ISIL, have emerged. In this kind of security environment we need to be dynamic and responsive.  What we have under sequestration or a long-term continuing resolution is a straitjacket.  We would be forced to make irresponsible reductions when our choices should be considered carefully and strategically.  Making these kinds of indiscriminate cuts is wasteful to taxpayers and to industry … dangerous for our strategy, unfair to our service members, and frankly, it’s embarrassing around the world. Much about the future is unclear, but not this: the self-inflicted damage from sequester, a long-term continuing resolution, and continued budget uncertainty would send the wrong message at the wrong time to the world. Without reinvestment and recapitalization, without a long-term budget horizon, we simply cannot achieve what AFA has brought us all together to achieve, which is reinventing the aerospace nation. Yesterday, yesterday, I had a chance to speak with a dozen of our most distinguished airmen who came by my office with their families. They were public health technicians and intelligence analysts, pararescuemen and cyber experts.  As individuals, they were remarkably impressive.  Taken together, they’re a powerful portrait of our country’s greatness.  They were a reminder of the dynamism of our military and our Air Force … of our ability to see beyond the horizon and seize opportunity, whatever the weather may bring. The Air Force delivers personnel, capabilities, and support over lands and oceans, from the biggest city to the smallest FOB.  It helps us to understand the world with clarity. It allows us to see what we can achieve…that we can achieve what we once believed impossible. The men and women of the Air Force and of this organization, AFA, have been a critical link between where we are and where we need to be. You have helped change this country and change the world. Together, in these next few weeks, we must push for the sensible decisions we need so the Air Force can continue to succeed, so that America can fly, and fight, and win … so that we can out-perform, out innovate, and out compete anyone in the world.  The decisions and investments we make in the next several months, and the next several years, will determine our strength and security for the next several decades. From cyberspace, to outer space, to the defense of the global commons, every one of us – not just in this room but across the country – benefits from the security and peace of mind the Air Force provides.  That’s why it is so important, and why we must all be part of the effort to reinvent what AFA calls our aerospace nation.  That’s our opportunity and that’s our obligation.  And that’s how we will continue America’s supremacy in air and space for the next aerospace century and beyond. Thank you. ",Remarks to the Air Force Association,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/617405/remarks-to-the-air-force-association/
"March 29, 2016","Well, thanks, Pat.  And thanks so much for welcoming both Stephanie and me here tonight. I stand between you and dinner, so I will be brief.  But first note, it's good to see so many ambassadors here.  Your presence represents the deep friendships that the United States has with so many countries around the world.  And what it represents is that we stand for common things, common values, a common ethos of civilization, and it today's world, that brings us even closer together, one of the themes of what I'll say in a moment. One of our closest allies has a new ambassador here.  So Kim and Vanessa, welcome to the Washington community. And many others.  I see Iraq here, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Ukraine, and I could go on and on and on.  Thank you all for being here and honoring us with your friendship.  To build cooperative relationships with your countries, countries that are strong enough and capable enough and connected enough to give our peoples the security and the opportunity to rise and thrive in what is still a young century. I also want to recognize Captain Flo Groberg. Flo, where are you? Last year, received our highest award, the Medal of Honor. Flo? Flo's still getting used to that but I've told him it's going to last his whole life long.  He represents the highest caliber of individuals who have helped defend our nation and what we all stand for, over 15 years in Iraq and also Afghanistan.  They represent a tradition of service and sacrifice that's been passed from generation to generation.  And earlier today, Secretary of Veterans Affairs McDonald and I laid a wreath at the Vietnam Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that war. There are a number of veterans here tonight, and I know that, and I want to take this opportunity, to the Vietnam veterans, to thank all of you for your service, and all veterans.  But to the Vietnam veterans especially, a special thanks that was not properly rendered when they first came home. Now I want to accept this award, not on my behalf but on behalf of all the magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense, those who continue that great legacy of service that I was honoring this morning. Right now, right now, as we're here tonight, there are 450,000 American men and women deployed across the globe, every time zone, every domain, in the air, the shore and the afloat, men and women who've answered the call of the noblest of missions, which is to provide security.  I always say that security is like oxygen.  If you have enough of it, you tend to pay no attention to it.  But if you don't have it, it's all you can think of.  The men and women of the U.S. military do what they do so that everybody else can sleep peacefully at night, wake up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, dream their dreams, live their lives.  That's what they do. And the United States is a great nation with great responsibilities.  And in this interconnected world, we can't afford to ignore either many of the challenges of our friends and allies together.  Our national defense strategy, our strategy, and by the way, the budget that I submitted earlier this month to Congress, reflects the need for us to confront five evolving challenges today; Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and ISIL, or terrorism more broadly.  We don't have the luxury of choice among these.  We have to do them all. The first two of these challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great power of competition of the past.  One is in Europe, where we're taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression.  And we haven't had to focus on that very much for a quarter century, since the Soviet Union ended and the Berlin Wall came down, but now we do. Second challenge is in the Asia Pacific, which is the single more consequential region to America's future because it's where half of humanity resides and half of economic activity of the planet, and that's only growing.  There, China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one.  And that's why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say and have said for decades now, this is their slogan, to “fight tonight.”  Not what we want to do, by any means, but we're ready to do. And the other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord reached last year is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and malign influence against our allies and friends. The fifth challenge – very different from the other four, very important – is our ongoing fight against terrorism, and specifically ISIL.  Last week's attacks in Brussels are a grim reminder of the dangers and the challenges that persist in this world.  Our thoughts and prayers are, first of all, with all of those who are affected by this tragedy, including American citizens, as well as citizens of many other countries represented here tonight. The United States military, us, we at the same time, are focused on winning this fight against ISIL and I'm confident we will.  We're accelerating our campaign to deal ISIL a lasting defeat, most immediately in Iraq and Syria.  That's where the parent tumor of this cancer is and we need to defeat it there.  It's necessary, but not sufficient.  We need to defeat it in other places to which it's metastasized, North Africa, Afghanistan and elsewhere.  And we, in defense, provide support to our intelligence in homeland security and federal and local law enforcement colleagues also to protect the homeland. The reality is we're bringing more and more power to bear against ISIL.  We're gathering momentum in this campaign.  We're systematically eliminating their cabinet, killing their financial chief and eliminating their minister of war just in the last two weeks. Our campaign plan is to work with local, capable and motivated forces to collapse ISIL's control, its power centers in Raqqah and Mosul, and we're doing so, we will do so. We've severed the main artery between Syria and northern Iraq.  Iraqi security forces are now advancing in directions – all directions and continue the envelopment of Mosul. We've set a course for the future: a future that will surely be competitive and demanding of America's leadership and values and military edge.  But in our overall approach, and also in our budget for that matter, we're taking the long view as well as the near-term view.  We have to because even as we fight today's fights, we must also be prepared for what might come, 10, 20, 30 years down the road. Last fall's Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and we're grateful for it.  It set the size of our budget.  And with this degree of certainty, we focused on its shape, changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era and to seize opportunities for the future. In order to succeed in our mission of national defense, we need not only strategic perspective, budget stability, but also – and this is where things connect with the theme of this evening and this wonderful organization that sponsors this evening – to think, as I tell our folks, outside of our five-sided box, the Pentagon, and foster a spirit of innovation and reform at every level.  That's why we're making increased investments in science and technology, innovating in our military operations and building new bridges in some cases, rebuilding bridges, so the amazing American technology industry to stay ahead of tomorrow's threats. Last week, I visited the U.S. Military Academy, West Point.  I had the opportunity to visit a physics lab where I observed undergraduate cadets – you'd have been so proud – working on very high-level projects.  And I told them how proud I was of them, not only for their considerable commitment to service but for their spirit of inquiry, for their pursuit of an education that will equip them with the careful and analytical and quantitative skills that will help them work through any problem they may encounter in the future.  They're learning what so many people never had the opportunity to learn, the ability to push beyond the barrier of their existing knowledge and discover new solutions. Competing for such good people, competing for people for what is, after all, an all-volunteer force, recruiting, retaining and then developing them is a critical part of our military edge, what I call the force of the future.  And everyone should understand this need and my commitment to meeting it. That's also why, among other things, we're opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access because we can't afford to not have access to half of our population.  And as good as America's technology is, it's nothing compared to our people. We're also implementing several new initiatives to create what I call off-ramps, which gives some of our own people, military and civilian, gives them the opportunity to get out and to learn about how the rest of the world works outside of our walls, and on-ramps, that allow more people outside DOD to engage with and contribute to our mission.  We want to make it possible for people outside DOD to come in for a while, try it, maybe not for a career but for a few years, maybe it'll stick, and contribute to our consequential mission. The World Affairs Council does an excellent job of doing just that, engaging citizens.  And I have the mission of engaging our citizenry in the noble and essential mission of national defense.  We have that in common.  And also with informing them of the challenges and the opportunities, the opportunities in today's world.  And we, at the Department of Defense, want to give citizens the opportunity to be part of something bigger than themselves, helping provide security by bringing ideas and perspective to the table. So I want to thank all of you for what you do and for this distinguished honor.  In a world that is more interconnected and more complex and more challenging, we need you.  Institutions like the World Affairs Council, dedicated to expanding understanding and cooperation, are more important than ever.  I'm grateful for everything you do. Thank you.  Thank you for representing our troops.  And bless you on this night.

"March 18, 2015","Thank you very much, Chairman Thornberry. Thank you, Congresswoman Davis, thank you also. And all the members of the committee, thank you for having me here today. It’s a pleasure to be with you once again. I’ve had the opportunity to speak with many of you before, but this is my first time testifying as the Secretary of Defense. And I know that all of you, all of you on the committee, including the 23 veterans on this committee, share the same devotion that I do to what is the finest fighting force the world has ever known – and to the defense of our great country. And I thank you for that. And I hope that my tenure as Secretary of Defense will be marked by partnership with you on their behalf. I’m here to present the President’s budget for the Department of Defense for this year – Fiscal Year 2016 – and I strongly support the President in requesting a defense budget above the artificial caps of the Budget Control Act – that is, above so-called sequester levels – next year, and in the years thereafter. I also share the President’s desire to find a way forward that upholds the fundamental principles behind the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. And I support his commitment to vetoing any bill that locks in sequestration. Because to do otherwise would be both unsafe and wasteful. The Administration’s therefore proposing to increase the defense budget in line with the projections submitted to Congress last year – halting the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, while giving us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. As the Chairman noted, strategy comes first. And that’s the appropriate way to think about the budget. But – and I want to be very clear about this – under sequestration, which is set to return in 197 days, our nation will be less secure. And Mr. Chairman, as you and your colleagues have said, sequestration threatens our military’s readiness. It threatens the size of our warfighting forces, the capabilities of our air and naval fleets, and ultimately, the lives of our men and women in uniform. And the Joint Chiefs have said the same. And the great tragedy is that this corrosive damage to our national security is not a result of objective factors, logic, or reason. Instead, sequester is purely the fallout of political gridlock. Its purpose was to compel prudent compromise on our long-term fiscal challenges – a compromise that never came. And this has been compounded in recent years, because the Defense Department has suffered a double whammy – the worst of both worlds – that has coupled mindless sequestration with constraints on our ability to reform. We need your help with both. And I know that Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and others on this committee are as dedicated to reform as I am. And I appreciate the – your dedication to it and the opportunity to work with you, because we at the Pentagon can and we must do better at getting value for the defense dollar. There are significant savings to be found across DoD, and we’re committed to pursuing them. But at the same time, I have to note that in the past several years, painful but necessary reforms proposed by DoD – reforms involving elimination of overhead and unneeded infrastructure, retirement of older systems, and reasonable adjustments in compensation – have been denied by Congress at the same time that sequestration has loomed. If confronted with sequestration-level budgets, and continued obstacles to reform, I do not believe that we can simply keep making incremental cuts. We would have to change the shape and not just the size of our military – significantly impacting parts of our defense strategy. We cannot meet sequester with further half-measures. As Secretary of Defense, I will not send troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, or ineffective doctrine. But everything else is on the table – including parts of our budget that have long been considered inviolate. This may lead to decisions that no Americans – including members of Congress – want us to make. And, now, I’m not afraid to ask the difficult questions. But if we’re stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. So instead of sequestration, I urge you to embrace the alternative – the alternative: building the force of the future, powerful enough to underwrite our strategy, equipped with boldly new technology, as the Chairman stressed. Leading in domains like cyber and space, being lean and efficient throughout the enterprise, showing resolve to friends and potential foes alike, and attracting and retaining the best Americans to our mission – Americans like the elite cyber warriors I met last week when I visited our Cyber Command. That’s the alternative that we can have without sequestration. So, Mr. Chairman, the world in 2014 was more complicated than anyone could have predicted. Given today’s security environment, the President’s proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is responsible, prudent, and essential for providing our troops what they need, and what they fully deserve. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. ",Opening Summary -- House Armed Services Committee (Budget Request),https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606655/opening-summary-house-armed-services-committee-budget-request/
"May 27, 2016","Thank you, Ted.  Good morning, midshipmen! Great to be here.  Ray, thank you, and thank you for those years of excellent service as our Secretary of the Navy. It’s a pleasure to serve beside you.  And Bob, there’s Bob, John likewise.  All our distinguished guests, the Academy faculty and staff, and so many family, friends all here to honor, to congratulate you, the class of 2016. Now, every commencement is important.  But those at our service academies have extra meaning. Today, you not only receive a degree that represents years of studying, striving – you take an oath to a life of service and sacrifice in the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Indeed, you’ve chosen one of the noblest professions there is – a profession in which you’ll be waking up every day to help defend this country and make a better world.  Thank you for doing so. And each of us on this stage, everyone sitting in these stands here, every American around the country is proud of you today.  And in the years to come, all of us will be counting on you. Based on your performances here, that faith is well placed. As the first Annapolis class with cyber majors, you’ve hacked the Yard, and you’re sending 27 new cyber operators into our force.  You survived Hurricane Sandy in Bancroft Hall, you weathered a government shutdown.  You’ve captured YouTube acclaim with “Naptown Funk.”  You’ve won back the Commander-in-Chief’s trophy, and beat Army again and again and…again…and again.  And you’ve earned Rhodes, and Mitchell, Truman scholarships, three Gates Scholarships, and even a sixth round selection in the NFL draft. On that last one… on that last one, Keenan and Chris, you are cleared and approved to defer your service so you can pursue your NFL dreams.  Go get ‘em. Now of course, I dare say, not every late night here was dedicated to studying; not every rough morning can be blamed on hard PT.  So for those who may be sweating a little extra under your choker collars this morning, I hereby grant amnesty to all midshipmen on restriction for minor conduct offenses.  This is a one-time deal. Let’s also thank the parents, grandparents, the siblings, spouses, and friends of our graduates. Our military families serve too.  Your love and support helped propel these men and women to, and through, the Academy.  And your love and support will continue to be critical to them – and to our nation – in the years ahead.  Graduates, let’s take a moment and give your family and friends a much-deserved standing ovation.  Thank you. Midshipmen, your education and training at this Academy have prepared you to be officers, to lead, at a time of remarkable change for our military and our world. You’ll lead our Force of the Future, one that will be just as excellent as the force we have today, but that will also be different in some ways.  As you all know, generations change, technologies change, labor markets change.  That’s why one of my responsibilities now – and also one of your jobs in the years ahead – is to make sure that amid all this change, we continue to recruit, develop, and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer…men and women like all of you.  And we’re going to do exactly that. You’ll also lead in a new strategic era.  Indeed, today's security environment is dramatically different from that of the last generation, or even the generation before that.  In this new era, you – and your generation – must meet no fewer than five major and immediate and evolving challenges. You will counter the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  You will manage historic change in the Asia-Pacific…where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  You will strengthen our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear pursuits and provocations.  You will check Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protect our friends and allies there.  You will accelerate the defeat of certain ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it metastasizes around the world, as well as protecting our people here in the homeland.  You will deal with all five of these challenges across all domains – not just see and air and land, but also in cyber, electronic warfare, outerspace.  And, of course, when you look at history, you see that we have a near-perfect record of failure when it comes to predicting the strategic future, so you need to be ready and agile to contend with a complex and uncertain future where new challenges will almost certainly arise. Now, the United States doesn’t have the luxury of being able to choose among these challenges – we have to do it all.  And there’s plenty to say about each one.  But because I don’t want to read of any complaints on Yik-Yak about commencement speech that goes on too long, my remarks are going to focus on just one of those five challenges…the region that is most vital to our future – home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy – and the one that will likely define many of your careers: namely, the Asia-Pacific. This Tuesday I will depart on my fifth trip to the region as Secretary of Defense.  And before I go, I want to talk with you about the essential, pivotal role the United States has long played in the Asia-Pacific, and what we – and each of you – will be doing in the coming years to protect America’s interests and ensure that region’s principled future. Last month, I laid a wreath at the American Cemetery in the Philippines, where 17,000 Americans are buried – many of them sailors and Marines, some who graduated from this very Academy.  Each of those lost, and many others, helped win World War II. They also won for the Asia-Pacific, and all its people and nations, the opportunity to realize a brighter future.  And, for decades since, day in, and day out, American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have worked to help ensure the region’s security and uphold a common set of principles for all countries there to follow…so that every nation and everyone there could rise and prosper. That’s been America’s objective and practice for decades, and across strategic eras.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has played an essential and pivotal role in Asia-Pacific…economically, politically, and militarily. And the history of the last century has taught us that the order upon which the Asia-Pacific’s security depends is anchored in those principles.  American servicemembers, like you, have helped write that history, and you will contribute soon to its next chapter. Think about it.  Over the last two decades, tens of thousands of sailors and Marines aboard the USS JOHN C. STENNIS, for example, have sailed for over 300,000 miles, just around the Asia-Pacific region.  They’ve launched countless sorties, made almost two dozen port calls, and worked with governments and militaries from Australia to the Republic of Korea, Malaysia to Japan. Naval aviators have flown P-3s over the region since 1962…helping keeping vigilant watch during the Cold War, helping manage regional crises, and helping keep waterways open for international commerce. Since 1981, thousands of American sailors and Marines have participated in more than 30 iterations of our bilateral exercise with the Philippines, called Balikatan, which has helped us stand shoulder-to-shoulder with one of our oldest allies in the region, and many observer nations with them. And for decades, sailors aboard the U.S.S. LASSEN and other vessels have conducted routine, lawful, and consistent Freedom of Navigation operations around the world, including in the South China Sea. Every port call and flight hour, every exercise and operation, and every sailor and every Marine has added a stitch to the fabric of the Asia-Pacific’s security and stability.  And they’ve helped uphold and defend important principles – like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make their own security and economic choices free from coercion and intimidation; strengthening international and regional institutions; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. For sailors and Marines like you, and for a maritime region like the Asia-Pacific, that last one is particularly critical, because it allows ships, people, and commerce to travel in peace.  And that’s why the United States, throughout its history, has stood up for the freedom of the seas around the world.  It’s why our sailors and Marines have helped uphold and protect free and open maritime access to the Asia-Pacific’s waterways.  And it’s one reason why we continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows: so others can do the same. We will continue to do so, you will continue to do so…to help maintain freedom of navigation and stand up for all these specific principles in the Asia-Pacific.  That’s because we’ve seen what good they produce, and how they’ve enabled countries throughout the region to make incredible progress.  Think about it, economic miracle after economic miracle has occurred there: first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, rose and prospered, and now, today, China and India are doing the same. We want that positive trend to continue because it has been beneficial to the U.S. economy and our interests as well as to the people there.  But that record of progress is all the more remarkable, especially when you consider that the region’s shattered state in the aftermath of World War II and that its post-war stability and prosperity have never been maintained by a region-wide structure the way Europe had NATO.  Instead, because our servicemembers have worked inclusively, in a principled and peaceful way, the United States has developed alliances and partnerships all over the region, from Japan and the Republic of Korea to India and Singapore.  These relationships have long supported the Asia-Pacific’s stability and prosperity, and they continue to do so today. Of course, the Asia-Pacific continues to be rich in great opportunities for the United States.  But challenges always accompany opportunities in times of change.  And not all the change in the region has been positive.  Indeed, in the South China Sea and elsewhere, there is a growing risk to the region’s prosperous future – even though it’s a future that many in the region have chosen, and are working toward together. China has taken some expansive and unprecedented actions in the South China Sea, pressing excessive maritime claims contrary to international law.  Its construction – and subsequent militarization – of artificial islands on disputed features far surpass all other land reclamation efforts by other nations there, all other combined.  And when other aircraft, ships, and even fishermen act in accordance with international law near these features, China tries to some times to turn them away. The United States is not a claimant in the current disputes, and we do not take a position on which claimant has the superior sovereignty claim over the disputed land features.  But we are determined to stand with partners in upholding core principles, like freedom of navigation and overflight, free flow of commerce, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, through legal means, in accordance with international law. We’re committed to ensuring these core principles apply equally in the South China Sea as they do everywhere else…because only by ensuring that everyone plays by the same rules can we avoid the mistakes of the past, where countries challenged one another in contests of strength and will, with disastrous consequences for humanity.  That is why we will not waver in our determination to uphold these core principles. Our Freedom of Navigation operations there, by the USS LASSEN and other vessels, are not statements about sovereignty or preferences for any country’s claims.  They are not new to the last year.  They are not confined to the South China Sea – we routinely conduct these operations all over the world.  Rather, each is a principled act meant to uphold the rights of all nations – the United States, China, and everyone else – to the freedom of the seas. In fact, what’s new and unique to this region is the assertion of claims, dredging, land reclamation, and militarization of features by several claimants but overwhelmingly by China. Now, our focus on upholding principles extends beyond the maritime domain.  For example, China wants its companies that depend on the Internet to flourish in the global marketplace so it can lift its people’s prosperity to globally-comparative levels after decades of poverty.  And yet, China’s cyber-actors have violated the spirit of the Internet – not to mention the law – to perpetrate large-scale intellectual property theft from American companies.  That’s why the President has been determined to develop international understandings of behavior in cyberspace. China also wants and enjoys all the benefits of free trade and a free Internet, while sometimes restricting both as they apply to them. In sum, on the seas, in cyberspace, in the global economy, and elsewhere, China has benefited from the principles and systems that others have worked to establish and uphold, including us.  But instead of helping sustain those very principles and systems that have served all of us so well, for so long, instead of working toward what… quote, called the “win-win cooperation” that Beijing publicly says it wants, China sometimes plays by its own rules...undercutting those principles. A model like that is out of step with where the region wants to go, and it’s counterproductive – it’s far from a “win-win.”  The result is that China’s actions could erect a Great Wall of self-isolation, as countries across the region – allies, partners, and the unaligned – are voicing concerns publicly and privately, at the highest levels, in regional meetings, and global fora.  Such a model reflects the region’s distant past, rather than the principled future we all want for the Asia-Pacific. Now, America’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, which President Obama launched while you were in high school, is not about any one country.  On the contrary, it was an affirmative investment in – and a U.S. Government-wide commitment to – an inclusive, principled future.  For example, one important component is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that will deepen regional trade relationships. The Defense Department is operationalizing the defense part of the rebalance by sending our most advanced capabilities to the region.  We’re doing this across the force, but let me give you some of our Navy and Marine Corps examples: we’re sending stealthy F-35 fighters, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, and our newest surface warfare ships, including our cutting-edge stealth destroyers, all to the Pacific. DoD’s budget invests significantly in payloads and platforms critical to the rebalance, like the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, the Virginia-class submarines, new undersea drones, as well as in areas like cyber, electronic warfare, and space.  And DoD’s planners and strategists are also developing new and innovative operational concepts. DoD maintains world-leading capabilities because we have made incomparable investments over decades, and our budget this year does the same.  It will take decades more for anyone to build the kind of military capability the United States possesses today.  This strength is not simply about dollar figures – it’s also about harnessing those dollars to a tremendous innovative and technological culture that only the United States has, and doing so to develop revolutionary technologies. The U.S. military also has unrivaled – and this is important – and hard-earned operational experience over the past 15 years.  No other military possesses this kind of skill and agility backed by experience. On top of all this, our allies and partners in the region also are a major source of our strategic strength and influence in the Asia-Pacific. And DoD is deepening and modernizing existing alliances and partnerships, developing new ones, and networking our defense relationships so all our countries can do more together.  You can see this networking in trilateral mechanisms, like our deepening U.S.-Japan-Australia cooperation, U.S.-Japan-India cooperation, and other broader multilateral arrangements.  And we’re weaving these various partnerships together to more effectively ensure the region’s continued stability and security. This network, over all, demonstrates the United States’ commitment to playing an essential and pivotal role in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.  By operationalizing the rebalance, by networking security with all the nations there, including China, and by continuing to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, we will continue to uphold and defend the principles and ensure security and stability in the Asia-Pacific. Now, some in China have argued the United States is an outsider to the region.  But, of course, we’re a Pacific nation.  Our treaty relationships, economic agreements, and long-welcomed military presence in the region have made us an Asia-Pacific stakeholder forever. China has also suggested that we separate the issues involved in the South China Sea from our broader relationship.  But the United States cannot do such a thing.  China’s actions there challenge fundamental principles, and we can’t look the other way. I want to be clear: our vision for the future of the region is not at odds with the interests of China or any other country.  Indeed, we welcome the emergence of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous China that plays a responsible role in world affairs.  The United States doesn’t seek confrontation with China.  We have many shared interests, and a productive and broad relationship, including long-standing military-to-military ties.  Ties, which…by the way, I hope to strengthen. In recent years, through new confidence-building measures and multilateral exercises like this summer’s RIMPAC, we’ve made great strides in forging more and better communication channels, and reducing the risk of miscalculations that could lead to crises.  The United States and China have also worked together on issues related to North Korea’s nuclear provocations, Iran’s nuclear program, climate change, and other things. And we want to do more good things together.  As we encourage and work with China to address these concerns, we will continue to stand by – and stand up for – every country that sees its future and its freedom of choice threatened.  We will continue to work toward greater cooperation.  And as we have done many times throughout our history, we will continue to stand strong and united within our country and with our partners and allies as we keep our eye on the long game there. One of the keys to our essential and pivotal role in the Asia-Pacific, our security network there, and our relationship with China, is our people…you, you, and all our sailors, Marines, and soldiers and airmen. Our people are the most important asset America has in the Asia-Pacific.  Right now, right now as we sit here, 365,000 American men and women in uniform are serving there, including nearly 109,000 sailors and more than 77,000 Marines.  And because you know how critical the Navy and Marine Corps are in this region, most of you will serve there and operationalize the rebalance as Ensigns or Second Lieutenants, or as you move up the ranks. As you do, you will not only meet your nation’s call.  You will also meet the call of our regional friends and allies, help defend and promote the principles that bind us all together. One of the constant things I hear in my travels, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, is how great our people are.  That’s never a surprise to me.  And it’s a strategic advantage: you, and all our people, are reasons why we have all the friends and allies around the world, and our adversaries don’t. The United States is one of the only countries to prepare and educate our military officers for global missions.  You’ve been trained here on the Yard to be principled leaders, to be ethical officers, to uphold our highest standards of honor and integrity.  That’s what I and the country expect from you. But you’re also some of the finest young men and women America has to offer.  You’re why the United States remains the security partner of choice in the Asia-Pacific and around the world, and why our circle of allies and partners continues to grow. Most important, you’re respectful of other people, and they – militaries and citizens of countries around the world with whom we partner and fight – appreciate how you conduct yourselves.  They’ve learned that you’re there not to intimidate, coerce, or exclude, but instead that you inspire, cooperate, and include. You draw people and countries to the United States, because each of you accepts your responsibilities with, as the Midshipman Prayer says, “a strong heart and a cheerful mind.”  You embody the values of this great country, the traditions of the Navy and the Corps, and the words of the oaths you’re taking today. Because of you, the United States will not only meet the five challenges we’re facing in Russia and China and North Korea and terrorism, especially ISIL; we will overcome those challenges.  We will also grab hold of the bright opportunities within our nation’s reach, not only in the Asia-Pacific, but around the world. It’s said that security is like oxygen: when you have enough of it you pay no attention to it.  But when you don’t have it, that’s all you can think of. Yours is a noble profession because each of you, your fellow sailors, sailors and Marines, and all our soldiers and airmen, provide that oxygen, the security that allows millions upon millions of people – not just in America, but in so much of the world – to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full. Every day, our servicemembers put their lives on the line to do so.  This isn’t a new commitment.  Some of you, with family who are serving or have served, grew up around it.  You saw it in your teachers and mentors here.  And I see it in each of you today. In a new strategic era, and at a time of great change, the United States must – and all of you will – continue to ensure that ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And you will continue to defend the security, stability, and prosperity that have meant so much to so many here at home and around the world. To do so we will invest and innovate…we will change how we plan, how we operate, and even how we fight.  But we’ll never change what we’re willing to fight for: for our safety and interests, for those of our friends and allies, and for the values and principles that have benefited so many for so long. Because we do so, because each of you does so, the United States will continue to meet the great responsibilities of our great nation. Congratulations.

"April 15, 2016","Thanks, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and you should know that you've got great leadership here.  I've known the Admiral for a long time, got a lot of regard for him and for all of you and what you do, and I'm here as always for you, and to say thank you. And I'm going to do this a little bit more formally than normal, and the reason for that is that I have with me the Defense Secretary of the Philippines, Voltaire Gazmin, a good friend of mine, a great ally, great partner, and so in view of that and in view of the importance of your mission, my  remarks are going to be a little bit formal okay, but bear with me, it's about your mission and its importance, so it's worth listening to. And then when I'm done I'll take questions from you and find out what's on your mind or what you think I ought to know, or a question, and then I'll give an answer.  Okey-doke? First of all I want to say something about my counterpart here, Voltaire Gazmin. For 65 years now our two nations have been standing together, the United States and the Philippines, and America's commitment to the Philippines, I need to say this, remains ironclad, and Voltaire came out to see you and your shipmates in action. He's going to say a few words to all of you in a moment, but he's been a longtime friend and colleague, of not only mine, but of the United States, and of this entire region, and, of course, a great defender of the Philippines. This has been a very busy and productive trip.  I visited India, where I saw some of your shipmates on the USS Blue Ridge, which was on port call in Goa.  We continued to make major advances there in the growing U.S.-India defense partnership, also important. And I was in Manila for meetings yesterday with Voltaire and other Philippine leaders, including the President.  Here also my visit was the occasion to inaugurate a major new era in a longstanding alliance, through the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, first of all, and our new Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative, second of all.  And as a result I'm proud to say this alliance is as close as it's been in years. But one of my most important opportunities on this trip is to come to see you and to thank you.   And I want to thank your families also for their support during this deployment and the rest of the year.  I never forget that families serve, too.  Thank you for what you're doing here in the Asia-Pacific, and what you're doing with your lives, because what you do, which is defending your country and making a better world for our children is one of the noblest things you can be doing with your life. I want you to know you should be proud of yourself, and how proud we are of you, not just in the Department of Defense, but the entire country.  I'm so proud to be in this Department with you. Every time I travel abroad, in conversations with counterparts like Voltaire and others, I always hear about how they like working with our folks, with people like you.  And when I ask why, they always say because of the values that you bring, the way that you conduct yourself, which is not only competent, awesomely competent, but it's respectful of other people, and they're right, and I want to thank each of you, not just for what you're doing, but perhaps, very importantly, how you're doing it.  You play an essential and pivotal role in this region, which I'll discuss in a moment, but you and the rest of the American military do that, and everything else around the world, in a principled and respectful way.  You don't intimidate people, coerce people or exclude people. Instead the American style has always been to include people in protecting us all.  That's what you're doing right now.  You've deployed for over 90 days, but I'm sure none of you are counting — although he is, I know — you've steamed over 20,000 miles.  You've flown over 4,000 sorties, you've participate in exercises like Balikatan.  You've excelled in the 3MI and you've performed other important duties.  You've worked near the Republic of Korea, through the Sea of Japan, in Guam, and now in the South China Sea. And this is not the Stennis' first time in these waters, or your last stop on this deployment.  The Stennis has sailed, not just here in the South China Sea, but all around the vast Asia-Pacific over many years, has been deployed, in the region six times just in the last several years, and this summer you'll take part in RIMPAC, which is the largest international maritime exercise in the world. All of that you've done with the excellence expected of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And as you continue to do so you're part of a long line of Americans, men and women, sailors and Marines, soldiers and airmen, uniformed and civilian, who've played an essential and pivotal role in ensuring that the Asia-Pacific right here remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper.  That's been American policy for decades.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world, during Democratic and Republican administrations and time of surplus and deficit, war and peace, through all of that, the United States had played a pivotal role economically, politically, and military in the Asia-Pacific. Along with a wide variety of partners and allies like the Philippines, the United States has for decades stood tall for enduring rules and principles, including the peaceful resolution of disputes, the ability of countries to make their own security and economic choices, free from coercion and intimidation, and freedom of navigation and overflight. And Americans like you help provide the necessary security and stability for this nation and this region to thrive with our strong defense engagements here.  The United States has long provided the necessary reassurance, an attractive and appealing reassurance, and worked to keep the peace here in the Asia Pacific.  And the results, as you know, have been extraordinary.  Since World War II millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, have been lifted from poverty and into the middle class here.  And even though there's still room for improvement, democracy and freedom has spread to places across the region, and economic miracle after economic miracle has occurred in the region.  First Japan, then Taiwan, then South Korea, Southeast Asia, where we are now, all rose and prospered.  And today China and India are doing the same. That progress creates opportunities for the region and for America to continue to grow, because we, after all, are a Pacific power, too. But, of course, those big changes can also produce some negatives.  And recently not all of the news out of the Asia-Pacific has been positive.  Indeed in the South China Sea, China's actions in particular are causing anxiety and raising regional tensions. In response, countries across the Asia-Pacific, both long-standing allies and new partners, are reaching out anew to the United States, to uphold the rules and principles that have allowed the region to thrive.  And we're answering that call.  We're standing with those countries.  We're standing up for those rules and principles.  We're making important new investments in defense technology, and we're continuing to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, and we always will, thanks to you. America's rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, which President Obama announced five years ago now, aims to sustain the progress occurring all around this region.  As part of the rebalance we've revitalized our economic, political and military engagement in this, this right here, which is the single most consequential region of the world for America's future. Militarily, the Department of Defense is operationalizing the next phase of the rebalance and cementing it for the long term.  We're bringing our best people, people like you, and our best platforms, like the Stennis, forward to the Asia-Pacific.  We're making new investments in key capabilities and platforms, and we're deepening up our lateral relationships, strengthening long-time alliances, like our relationship with the Philippines and deepening ties with newer partners, like India. But, in a large and interconnected region we're taking an additional step.  As the region changes the United States is networking our bilateral relationships with trilateral and multilateral arrangements, weaving these partnerships together to more effectively bolster American and regional security.  This is the network, peaceful, principled, and inclusive, that America continues to stand for and stand with.  It demonstrates the United States’ commitment to remaining an essential and pivotal leader in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come. And I never forget what makes all of that that possible, and that's you.  You play the essential and pivotal role here.  You are operationalizing the rebalance.  You are making our growing security network work.  With every deployment and cruise by the Stennis, with every sortie, every exchange and port call, every time you participate in an exercise like Balikatan anywhere in the region, we add a stitch to the fabric of the region's security network. You know, it's said that security is like oxygen: when you have enough of it you pay no attention to it.  But when you don't have it, that's all you can think of.  You, your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, provide that oxygen, the security that allows millions upon millions of people, not just in America, and not just here in the Asia-Pacific, but in so much of the world, to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full. That's what it's all about, and we will continue to stand up for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies, and for the values, principles, and rules-based order that has benefited so many for so long.  Because we do so, because each of you does do, we all will continue to ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper for generations to come. Thank you all for what you're doing out here. ",Remarks to the Sailors of USS Stennis ,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/737996/remarks-to-the-sailors-of-uss-stennis/
"Dec. 9, 2015"," Chairman [McCain], Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me to discuss the U.S. counter-ISIL military campaign with Vice Chairman Paul Selva here. Chairman Dunford is, as you know, currently visiting our troops deployed around the world this holiday season, conveying to them the thanks of a grateful nation for all they do in our defense. I will soon be doing the same. And Chairman, you’re right, Ranking Member Reed – we are intensifying the campaign, and have in the six weeks since I appeared before you last time. And I’m happy to be here today and to describe what we’re doing. And it’s very much along the lines of which you just described, that is, forces to accompany, to call in an airstrike, to conduct counterterrorism strikes, and train and equip. So I’ll describe those actions we’re taking. Because the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino were an assault on the civilization that we defend. ISIL requires, and it will receive, a lasting defeat. The President has directed us to intensify and adapt the military campaign – I’m sorry, had directed us – to intensify the military campaign before the Paris attacks. The necessity of accelerating our efforts, as we’re doing, has only been made more plain by the recent attacks. We are urging others in the region and around the world to do the same, because those attacks further highlighted the stakes that not just the United States but the world has in this fight. The defense of the homeland must be strengthened, to be sure, but it is absolutely necessary to defeat ISIL in its parent tumor in Syria and Iraq, and also to take necessary action wherever else in the world this evil organization metastasizes. Achieving these objectives means leveraging all the components of our nation’s might, as the Chairman noted – diplomatic, military, law enforcement, homeland security, intelligence, economic, informational. That’s the right overall approach for three principal reasons. First, the strategy takes the fight to the enemy where they are, which we must do. Second, it seeks to develop capable, motivated, local ground forces as the only force that can assure a lasting victory. U.S. and international coalition forces can and will do more to enable them, but we cannot substitute for them. And third, it seeks to set the conditions for a political solution to the civil war in Syria and for inclusive governance in Iraq, both which are essential because they are the only durable ways to prevent a future ISIL-like organization from re-emerging there. And that’s why the diplomatic work, led by Secretary Kerry is the first and absolutely critical line of effort in our strategy. The Defense Department is, of course, centrally responsible for the military campaign, which is the focus of my statement today. Through our and our coalition partners’ actions, the military campaign must and will deny ISIL any safe territorial haven, kill or capture its leadership and forces, and destroy its organization – all while we seek to identify and then enable capable, motivated local forces on the ground who can expel ISIL from the territory it now controls, hold it and govern it, and ensure that victory sticks. Militarily, we are taking new steps each week to gather momentum on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. I’ll take a few extra minutes this morning to give as much detail as possible about the new things we are doing – applying multiple pressures, on multiple fronts, simultaneously – to accelerate ISIL’s defeat. The reality is, we’re at war. That’s how our troops feel about it, because they’re taking the fight to ISIL every day – applying the might of the finest fighting force the world has ever known. In northern Syria, local forces, with our support, are fighting along the Ma’ra line, engaging ISIL in the last remaining pocket of access into Turkey. Meanwhile, a coalition of Syrian Arabs that we helped equip in Northeastern Syria are fighting alongside Kurdish forces and have recaptured important terrain, most recently pushing ISIL out of the town of Al Hawl and at least 900 square kilometers of surrounding territory. They are now focused on moving south to isolate ISIL’s so-called capital of Raqqa, with the ultimate objective of collapsing its control over the city. To build on that, President Obama, on my and Chairman Dunford’s advice, ordered U.S. special operations forces to go into Syria to support the fight against ISIL. American special operators bring a unique set of capabilities that make them force multipliers, such as intelligence gathering, targeting, and enabling local forces. Where we find further opportunity to leverage such capability, we will not hesitate to expand it. Next, in the south of Syria, we are also taking advantage of opportunities to enable indigenous fighters, trained and equipped by us and other Coalition partners, to conduct strikes inside Syria. We are also enhancing Jordan’s border control and defenses with additional military assets and planning assistance. Turning to northern Iraq, Peshmerga units, with the help of U.S. power – air power – and advisers, have retaken the town of Sinjar, cutting the main line of communication between Raqqa and Mosul, the two largest cities under ISIL’s control. To move people and supplies, ISIL must now rely on backroads, where we will locate and destroy them. Elsewhere in Iraq, we have about 3,500 troops at six locations in support of Iraqi Security Forces, or ISF. There, we’ve been providing increased lethal fire and augmenting the existing training, advising, and assisting program. And we’re prepared to do more as Iraq shows capability and motivation in the counter-ISIL fight and in resolving its political divisions. After a frustratingly long time, we are starting to see some movement in the operation to recapture Ramadi. Over the past several months, the coalition has provided specialized training and equipment – including combat engineering techniques like in-stride breaching and bulldozing, and munitions like AT-4 shoulder-fired missiles to stop truck bombs – to the Iraqi Army and its counter-terrorism service units that are now beginning to enter Ramadi neighborhoods from multiple directions. In fact, in the last 24 hours, the ISF retook the Anbar Operations Center on the northern bank of the Euphrates River across from Ramadi’s city center. This is an important step, but there is still tough fighting ahead. ISIL has counter-attacked several times, but thus far the ISF has shown resilience. The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisors, if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister Abadi. I mention all this because it represents how we’ve adapted in the way we support our Iraqi partners.  And it shows that training, advising, and assisting is the right approach.  We will do more of what works going forward. While we are focused on making additional tactical gains, the overall progress in the Sunni-populated areas of Iraq has been slow, much to Prime Minister Abadi’s and our frustration. Indeed, with respect to Sunni tribal forces, we are urging the Iraqi government to do more to recruit, train, arm, and mobilize Sunni popular mobilization fighters in their communities. We continue to engage the Iraqi government at all levels to move forward on this critically important aspect of the counter-ISIL campaign, including working with Sunni local police to ensure there is an Iraqi hold force to sustain future gains. Next, in full coordination with the government of Iraq, we’re deploying a specialized expeditionary targeting force to assist the ISF and Kurdish Peshmerga forces and put even more pressure on ISIL through a variety of raids and intelligence gathering missions. This force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations in Syria. In Iraq, the force will operate at the invitation of the Iraqi government and focus on defending its borders and building the ISF’s ability to conduct similar operations. We will not be discussing specifics of this expeditionary targeting force or its operations in unclassified settings, both to protect our forces and to preserve the element of surprise. We want this expeditionary targeting force to make ISIL and its leaders wonder when they go to bed at night, who’s going to be coming in the window. Chairman Dunford and I recognize that in principle there are alternatives to the strategic approach we have adopted to drive ISIL from Syrian and Iraqi territory – including the introduction of a significant foreign ground force, hypothetically international but including U.S. forces – even in the absence of capable, motivated, local ground forces. While we certainly have the capability to furnish a U.S. component to such a ground force, we have not recommended this course of action for several reasons: In the near-term, it would be a significant undertaking that much as we would wish otherwise, realistically, we would embark upon largely by ourselves; and it would be ceding our comparative advantage of special forces, mobility, and firepower, instead fighting on the enemy’s terms. In the medium-term, by seeming to Americanize the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, we could well turn those fighting ISIL or inclined to resist their rule into fighting us instead. As Chairman Dunford testified last week, quote, ISIL “would love nothing more than a large presence of U.S. forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria, so that they could have a call to jihad.” And lastly, in the long-term, there would still remain the problem of securing and governing the territory – these must be done by local forces. So in the end, while we can enable them, we cannot substitute for them. Next, momentum on the ground in both Syria and Iraq has been enabled by greatly increased coalition airstrikes. Additional strike aircraft we’ve deployed to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey along with improved intelligence allowed us, in November, to significantly increase our airstrikes against ISIL, to the highest level since the start of our operations in August 2014. Moreover, because of improved intelligence and understanding of ISIL’s operations, we’ve intensified the air campaign against ISIL’s war-sustaining oil enterprise, a critical pillar of ISIL’s financial infrastructure. In addition to destroying fixed facilities like wells and processing facilities, we’ve destroyed nearly 400 of ISIL’s oil tanker trucks, reducing a major source of its daily revenues. There’s more to come too. We’re also improving our capability to eliminate ISIL’s leadership. Since I last appeared before this committee in late October, we have removed two more key ISIL figures from the battlefield – namely, “Jihadi John,” an ISIL executioner; and Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya. Like previous actions, these strikes serve notice to ISIL that no target is beyond our reach. And, as our military campaign intensifies on the ground and in the air, the Defense Department is also developing more strategic options in the cyber domain. These then are just nine areas of the adaptations we’ve made over the past six weeks to accelerate this campaign, and we’ve seen momentum build. President Obama is committed to doing what it takes – as opportunities arise, as we see what works, and as the enemy adapts – until ISIL is defeated in a lasting way. The President has consistently supported the recommendations from me and General Dunford and we know he is prepared for us to bring him more. We will. At the same time that we’re constantly looking to do more in this fight, the world must do the same. The international community – including our allies and partners – has to step up before another attack like Paris. France was galvanized by the attack on its capital, and intensified its role. Britain has now expanded its air campaign to strike ISIL in Syria. Italy has deployed its most elite police units, the Carabinieri, to assist in Iraq. Germany is now making additional contributions. And the Netherlands is actively considering doing more as well. But we all, let me repeat that, all must do more. Turkey must do more to control its often porous border. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states joined the air portion of the campaign in the early days – only the air part – but have since been pre-occupied by the conflict in Yemen, both in the air and on the ground. And just this past week, I personally reached out to my counterparts in 40 countries around the world in the coalition to ask them to contribute more, and in many cases contribute much more, to enhancing the fight against ISIL. The types of things I’ve requested from our partners include special operations forces, strike and reconnaissance aircraft, weapons and munitions, training assistance, and other items. Meanwhile, as the Chairman noted, Russia, which has publicly committed to defeating ISIL, has instead largely attacked opposition forces. It’s time for Russia to focus on the right side of this fight. Before I conclude, I’d like to respectfully request the committee’s attention to matters that bear upon our security and its responsibilities. First, over a month ago I submitted a request to the four Congressional defense committees, including this one, to release ‘holds’ on the final tranche of funds in the Syria equipping program – that is, some $116 million dollars. We need these funds to provide and transport ammunition, weapons, and other equipment to further enable the progress being made against ISIL in Syria by partners like the Syrian Arab Coalition. All four committees have failed to act on that request, and I ask you to release these holds urgently. We should not be impeding the very momentum we are trying to build. Next is the necessity to fill key vacancies in the Defense Department’s critical leadership positions. I have appeared before this committee six times over the last 10 months – four times on the Middle East, and twice in just the last six weeks on ISIL. While this committee has held 58 full hearings over the last year, only three have been confirmation hearings for DoD civilian leaders. DoD currently has 16 nominees awaiting the Constitutional advice and consent of the Senate. Twelve of these 16 are still awaiting even a hearing – including our nominees to be Secretary of the Army, the Under Secretaries of each of our three military departments – Army, Navy, and Air Force – and the Under Secretaries of both Intelligence and Personnel and Readiness. These positions should be filled by confirmed nominees, especially in a time of conflict. So I welcome that the process is now moving, and I urge it to move quickly for all of our civilian nominees, and also for senior military nominations that will be made next year. Finally, as I conclude, I want to commend this committee on last month’s budget deal, which is the kind of deal I called for back in March. It was a consequential agreement for the nation’s security. As current funding for the government is set to expire, it is vital that the two houses now conclude work on funding all of the government consistent with the budget deal. Now is not the time for more gridlock. I thank this committee in advance for your efforts, because funding this budget deal is what our national security demands. And it sends the right message to our troops, our allies, and our enemies in this time of broad global national security challenges – and especially in this war. Thank you.  ",Statement on the Counter-ISIL Campaign before the Senate Armed Services Committee,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/633510/statement-on-the-counter-isil-campaign-before-the-senate-armed-services-committ/
"Sept. 16, 2014","Mr. Chairman, as I was saying, Chairman Dempsey and I very much appreciate the opportunity this morning to discuss the President's strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.

	As you know, you all know, today President Obama's in Atlanta meeting with CDC officials regarding the Ebola crisis and then will travel tonight to Tampa to receive a briefing from the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Austin, on operational plans to implement his ISIL strategy. I'll join the President tomorrow in Tampa for that briefing.

	The Defense Department civilian and military leaders are in complete agreement that the United States and our allies and partners must take action against ISIL and that the President's strategy is the right approach.

	However, as President Obama has repeatedly made clear, American military power alone cannot, will not eradicate the threats posed by ISIL to the United States, our allies, and our friends and partners in the region.  Iraq's continued political progress toward a more inclusive and representative government in its programs of reform and reconciliation will be critical to achieve the progress required. We believe that new Iraqi minister, Prime Minister Abadi is committed to bringing all Iraqis together against ISIL.  To support him and the Iraqi people in their fight, the coalition will need to use all its instruments of power. We intend to use all of those instruments of power, military, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic, and intelligence in coordination with all the countries in the region.

	To succeed, this strategy will also require a strong partnership between our executive branch and our Congress. The President has made it a priority to consult with congressional leadership on the ISIL challenge, as have Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry and many senior members of the administration. I have appreciated the opportunities I've had to discuss the President's strategy with many members of this committee and other members of the Senate and the House over the last couple of weeks. We will continue to consult closely with Congress as this campaign moves forward. ISIL poses a real threat to all countries in the Middle East, our European allies and to America. In the last few months, the world has seen ISIL's barbarity up close as its fighters advanced across western and northern Iraq and slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians, including Sunni and Shia Muslims and Kurdish Iraqis and religious minorities.  ISIL's murder of two U.S. journalists outraged the American people and exposed to the world the depravity of ISIL's ideology and tactics.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL's murder of a British citizen. ISIL now controls a vast swath of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq including towns and cities in all these areas. ISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  And it has seized territory across both countries and acquired significant resources and advanced weapons. ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.

	ISIL has been very adept at [deploying] technology and social media to increase its global profile and attract tens of thousands of fighters. Its goal is to become the new vanguard of a global extremist movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden's legacy.

	While ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American citizens in Iraq and our interests in the Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including Europeans and more than 100 Americans have traveled to Syria.  With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL's safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.

	Although the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the U.S. homeland, ISIL has global aspirations. And as President Obama has made clear, ISIL's leaders have threatened America and our allies. If left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies.

	In his address to the nation last week, President Obama announced that the United States will lead a broad multinational coalition to roll back the ISIL threat. More than 40 nations have already expressed their willingness to participate in this effort and more than 30 nations have indicated their readiness to offer military support.  President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry and I and others have been working and will continue to work to unite and expand this coalition.  At the NATO summit in Wales, Secretary Kerry and I convened a meeting of key partners in the coalition. I then went to Georgia and Turkey. The Georgians made clear that they want to help.  Turkey, by virtue of its geography and its common interests in destroying ISIL, which is holding 46 Turkish diplomats hostage, will play an important role, an important role in this effort. Turkey joined our meeting in Wales and Secretary Kerry and I continue to discuss specific contributions Turkey will make.

	Secretary Kerry convened a meeting in Jeddah last week with the foreign ministers from the six Gulf [Cooperation] Council nations, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon and all signed a communiqué to “do their share in the comprehensive fight against ISIL, including…joining in the many aspects of a coordinated military campaign against ISIL.”

	Also last week 22 nations of the Arab League adopted a resolution at their summit in Cairo, calling for comprehensive measures to combat ISIL. And yesterday in Paris, French President Hollande - who traveled to Baghdad last weekend - hosted a conference attended by U.N. Security Council permanent members, European and Arab leaders and representatives of the E.U., Arab League and the United Nations.  They all pledged to help Iraq in the fight against ISIL, including through military assistance.

	Key allies such as United Kingdom, France and Australia are already contributing military support and other partners have begun to make specific offers.  At next week's U.N. General Assembly, we expect that additional nations will begin making commitments across the spectrum of capabilities, building on the strong Chapter VII U.N. Security resolution adopted last month, calling on all member states to take measures to counter ISIL and suppress the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL.  Also next week, President Obama will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to further mobilize the international community. As you all know, former International Security Assistance Force Commander and acting CENTCOM Commander General John Allen has been designated to serve as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.  President Obama is meeting with General Allen this morning. General Allen will work in a civilian diplomatic capacity to coordinate, build and sustain the coalition, drawing on his expensive experience in the region. He will be the administration's point man to coordinate coalition contributions and to build support within the region.  He will work closely with General Austin to ensure that coalition efforts are aligned across all elements of our strategy. In his address to the nation, the President outlined the four elements of this strategy, to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. Let me now describe how we are implementing this whole of government approach. First, in close coordination with the new Iraqi government, we are broadening our air campaign to conduct systemic airstrikes against ISIL targets. To protect Americans threatened by ISIL's advances, and to prevent humanitarian catastrophe, the U.S. military has already conducted more than 160 successful airstrikes which have killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons and equipment and enabled Iraqi and Kurdish forces to get back on the offenses and secure key territory and critical infrastructure, including the Mosul and Haditha Dams. These actions have disrupted ISIL tactically and have helped buy time for the Iraqi government to begin forming an inclusive and broad- based governing coalition led by the new prime minister. That was one of President Obama's essential pre-conditions for taking further action against ISIL, because the Iraqi people, the Iraqi people must be united in their opposition against ISIL in order to defeat them, this will require a united and inclusive government. This is ultimately their fight. The new broader air campaign will include strikes against all ISIL targets and enable the Iraqi security forces, including Kurdish forces, to continue to stay on the offensive and recapture territory from ISIL and hold it. Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi-Syrian border and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a broader -- by a border in name only. As the President said last week, “if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.” The President of the United States has the constitutional and the statutory authority to use military force against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq. And CENTCOM is refining and finalizing those plans, which General Austin will brief to the President tomorrow in Tampa.  This plan includes targeted actions against ISIL safe havens in Syria, including its command and control logistics capabilities and infrastructure. General Dempsey and I have both reviewed and approved the CENTCOM plan. The second element of the strategy is to increase our support for forces fighting ISIL on the ground, the Iraqi and Kurdish forces and the moderate Syrian opposition. To support Iraqi and Kurdish forces, the President announced last week that he would deploy an additional 475 American troops to Iraq. Part of that number includes approximately 150 advisers and support personnel who supplement forces already in Iraq, conducting assessments of the Iraqi security forces. This assessment mission is now transitioning to an advise-and-assist mission with more than 15 teams embedding with Iraqi Security Forces at the headquarters level to provide strategic and operational advice and assistance. The rest of the additional 475 troops include 125 personnel to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions out of Irbil and 200 personnel to increase headquarters elements in both Baghdad and Irbil, helping us better coordinate military activities across Iraq.

	By the time all these forces arrive, there will be approximately 1,600 U.S. personnel in Iraq responding to the ISIL threat. But as the President said last week, “American forces will not have a combat mission.”

	Instead these advisers are supporting Iraqi and Kurdish forces and supporting the government's plan to stand up Iraqi National Guard units to help Sunni communities defeat ISIL. The best counterweights to ISIL are local forces and the people of the area. And, as you know, in June, the President asked Congress for the necessary authority for DOD to train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces and $500 million to fund this program.

	We have now secured support from Saudi Arabia to host the training program for this mission and Saudi Arabia has offered financial and other support, as well.

	The $500 million request the President made in June for this train-and-equip program reflects CENTCOM's estimate of the cost to train, equip and resupply more than 5,000 opposition forces over one year.  The package of assistance that we initially provide would consist of small arms, vehicles and basic equipment like communications as well as tactical and strategic training. As these forces prove their effectiveness on the battlefield, we would be prepared to provide increasingly sophisticated types of assistance to the most trusted commanders and capable forces.  Because DOD does not currently have the authority to conduct a train-and-equip mission, the administration has asked Congress to provide the authority in the continuing resolution it is currently now considering.

	A rigorous vetting process will be critical to the success of this program. The DOD will work closely with the State Department, the intelligence community and our partners in the region to screen and vet the forces we train and equip.  We will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons do not fall into the hands of radical elements of the opposition, ISIL, the Syrian regime or other extremist groups. There will always be risks. There will always be risks in a program like this. But we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria. As we pursue this program, the United States will continue to press for a political resolution to the Syrian conflict resulting in the end of the Assad regime. Assad has lost all legitimacy to govern and has created conditions that allowed ISIL and other terrorist groups to gain ground and terrorize and slaughter the Syrian population.  The United States will not coordinate or cooperate with the Assad regime. We will also continue to counter Assad through diplomatic and economic pressure.

	The third element of the President's strategy is an all-inclusive approach to preventing attacks from ISIL against the homelands of the United States and our allies.  In concert with our international partners, the United States will draw on intelligence, law enforcement, diplomatic and economic tools to cut off ISIL's funding, improve our intelligence, strengthen homeland defense, and stem the flow of foreign fighters in and out of the region.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have launched an initiative to partner with local communities to counter extremist recruiting, and the Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence is working to disrupt ISIL's financing and expose their activities.

	The final element of the President's strategy is to continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians displaced or threatened by ISIL.

	Alongside the government of Iraq, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and France, U.S. troops have already delivered life saving aid to thousands of threatened Iraqi civilians on Mt. Sinjar and the Iraqi town of Amirli.  In total the U.S. military conducted 32 air drops of food and supplies providing over 818,000 pounds of aid, including nearly 50,000 gallons of water and nearly 122,000 meals ready to eat in these operations.

	In addition to this assistance, last week the State Department announced an additional $48 million in aid for civilian organizations to meet the urgent needs of Iraqis displaced by ISIL. Our total humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqis is now more than $186 million for fiscal year 2014.

	The United States is also the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance for the millions of Syrians affected by the civil war. Last week Secretary Kerry announced an additional $500 million in humanitarian assistance.  Since the start of the Syrian conflict, the United States has now committed almost $3 billion in humanitarian assistance to those affected by the civil war.

	All four elements of this strategy require a significant commitment of resources on the part of the United States and our coalition partners. Mr. Chairman, I think everyone on this committee understands fully that this will not be an easy or a brief effort. It is complicated. We are at war with ISIL as we are with Al Qaeda. But destroying ISIL will require more than military efforts alone. It will require political progress in the region, and effective partners on the ground in Iraq and Syria.  As the Congress and administration work together, we know this effort will take time. The President has outlined a clear, comprehensive and workable strategy to achieve our goals and protect our interests.

	Mr. Chairman, Senator Inhofe, thank you for your continued support and that of this committee, and your partnership. Thank you.

"March 4, 2015","Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, Members of the Committee:  thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget request for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Oversight is key to our system of government.  I not only welcome your wisdom and experience; I also want your partnership, and need your help. I also want to thank Chairman Dempsey for his leadership, as well as Deputy Secretary Work and Vice Chairman Winnefeld, in particular for all their hard work over the past year in helping develop the budget request we will be discussing today.  I. INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY During my first week as Secretary of Defense, I had the opportunity to see our troops in Afghanistan and Kuwait.  Hearing from them was one of my highest priorities upon taking office. In Afghanistan, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are helping cement progress made toward a more secure, stable, and prosperous future, by training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and continuing their counter-terrorism mission.  They are working to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our homeland, or on our partners and allies. In Kuwait, our men and women in uniform are contributing to our counter-ISIL coalition in Iraq and Syria.  They are working closely with Iraq and our global coalition partners to ensure that local forces can deliver lasting defeat to a vile enemy that has barbarically murdered American citizens, Iraqis, Syrians, and so many others, and that seeks to export its hateful and twisted ideology across the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. No doubt the challenges and opportunities we face extend well beyond the Middle East. In Europe, our troops are helping reinforce and reassure our allies in Eastern Europe as we confront a reversion to archaic security thinking. In the Asia-Pacific – home to half the world’s population and economy – they are working to modernize our alliances, build new partnerships, and helping the United States continue to underwrite stability, peace, and prosperity in the region – as we have for decades. And as we still meet longtime challenges, such as the continuing imperative to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction, our armed forces are also addressing new dangers, such as in cyberspace. Across the world, it is America’s leadership, and America’s men and women in uniform, who often stand between disorder and order – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing behind those who believe in a more secure, just, and prosperous future. Mr. Chairman, this committee and this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so – whether they can continue to defend our nation’s interests around the world with the readiness, capability, and excellence our nation has grown accustomed to, and sometimes taken for granted. Halting and reversing the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. It would ensure we field a modern, ready force in a balanced way, while also embracing change and reform, because asking for more taxpayer dollars requires we hold up our end of the bargain – by ensuring that every dollar is well-spent. The President is proposing to increase the defense budget in Fiscal Year 2016, but in line with the projection he submitted to Congress last year in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget’s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The department is executing the plan it presented last year.  Accordingly, for Fiscal Year 2016, the President is proposing $534 billion for DoD’s base budget and $51 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), totaling $585 billion to sustain America’s national security and defense strategies. The Defense Department needs your support for this budget, which is driven by strategy, not the other way around.  More specifically, it is driven by the defense strategy identified in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which reflects the longtime, bipartisan consensus that our military must protect the homeland, build security globally, and project power and win decisively.  We do so in line with our longstanding tradition of maintaining a superior force with an unmatched technological edge, working in close partnership with friends and allies, upholding the rules-based international order, and keeping our commitments to the people who make up the all-volunteer force. Our defense budget’s priorities line up with our strategic priorities:  sustaining America’s global leadership by:  This budget ensures we can execute our defense strategy with manageable risk, even as it does require us to accept elevated risk in some areas. But – and I want to be clear about this – parts of our nation’s defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration, which remains the law of the land and is set to return 211 days from today. As I have said before, the prospect of sequestration’s serious damage to our national security and economy is tragically not a result of an economic emergency or recession. It is not because these budget cuts are a mathematical solution to the nation’s overall fiscal challenge – they are not. It is not because paths of curbing nondiscretionary spending and reforming our tax system have been explored and exhausted – they have not. It is not due to a breakthrough in military technology or a new strategic insight that somehow makes continued defense spending unnecessary – there has been no such silver bullet. And it is not because the world has suddenly become more peaceful – for it is abundantly clear that it has not. Instead, sequestration is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.  And friends and potential enemies around the world are watching. We in the Department of Defense are prepared to make difficult strategic and budgetary choices.  We are also committed – more than ever before – to finding new ways to improve the way we do business and be more efficient and accountable in our defense spending. But in order to ensure our military remains the world’s finest fighting force, we need to banish the clouds of fiscal uncertainty that have obscured our plans and forced inefficient choices.  We need a long-term restoration of normal budgeting and a deal that the President can sign, and that lives up to our responsibility of defending this country and the global order.  And that means, among other things, avoiding sequestration. To be sure, even under sequestration, America will remain the world’s strongest military power.  But under sequestration, our military – and our national security – would have to take on irresponsible and unnecessary risk – risk that previous Administrations and Congressional leaders have wisely chosen to avoid. Sequestration would lead over time to a military that looks fundamentally different and performs much differently than what we are used to.  Not only as Secretary of Defense, but simply as an American, I deeply, earnestly hope we can avert that future.  I am committed to working with the members of this committee, and your colleagues throughout the Congress to prevent it. I know how proud you and all Americans are that we field the finest fighting force in the world.  But our military superiority was not built, and will not be sustained, by resting on our laurels.  So instead of resigning ourselves to having the diminished military that sequestration would give us, I propose that we build the force of the future, together.  II. BUILDING THE FORCE OF THE FUTURE Assuming the Congress funds the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget and averts sequestration, we have the opportunity to build the force of the future.  We have inherited a long tradition of military excellence from those who came before us, and we must preserve it for those who will come after. But to do so, DoD must embrace the future – and embrace change – throughout our institution.  We must be open to new ideas and new ways of doing business that can help us operate more efficiently and perform more effectively in an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment. As DoD counters the very real dangers we face in the world, we will also grab hold of the bright opportunities before us – opportunities to be more competitive and re-forge our nation’s military and defense establishment into a future force that harnesses and develops the latest, cutting-edge technology, and that remains superior to any potential adversary; one that is efficient and accountable to the taxpayers who support it; and one that competes and succeeds in attracting the next generation of talented Americans to fill its ranks. These are the three main pillars on which DoD will build the force of the future. Competitiveness through Technological and Operational Superiority As other nations pursue comprehensive military modernization programs and develop technologies designed to blunt our military’s traditional advantages, the first pillar of our future force must be ensuring that we maintain – and extend – our technological edge over any potential adversary. The President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget includes targeted investments in modernized space, cyber, and missile defense capabilities geared toward countering emerging threats that could upend our technological superiority and our ability to project power.  DoD would look forward to providing a full account of our proposed modernization investments, and the threats that compel them, in a classified setting. The budget also supports the Defense Innovation Initiative, which will help ensure the military continues to ride the leading edge of innovation, and makes deferred modernization investments that will ensure America’s nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective.  Across all these efforts, we must be open to global, commercial technology as well, and learn from advances in the private sector. Because we know that technology alone – however advanced – cannot sustain our military’s superiority, just as important is a ruthless focus on operational excellence.  This means using our existing forces and capabilities in new, creative, and fiscally prudent ways to achieve our objectives.  This also means working to develop more innovative and effective strategic and military options for the President, introducing a new and more rapidly responsive global force management model, developing new operational concepts, and reforming and updating all our operational plans. Competitiveness through Accountability & Efficiency The second pillar of building the force of the future requires redoubling our efforts to make DoD more accountable and efficient.  We live in a competitive world and need to be a competitive organization.  If we don’t lean ourselves out and maintain our fighting weight, we have no business asking our fellow citizens for more resources. As I made clear in my confirmation hearing, I cannot suggest greater support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is always spent as well as it should be. American taxpayers rightly have trouble comprehending – let alone supporting – the defense budget when they read of cost overruns, insufficient accounting and accountability, needless overhead, and the like. If we’re asking taxpayers to not only give us half a trillion of their hard-earned dollars, but also give us more than we got last year, we have to demonstrate that we can be responsible with it. We must do all we can to spend their money more wisely and more responsibly.  We must reduce overhead, and we must curb wasteful spending practices wherever they are. DoD has sought to continuously improve our acquisition processes over the past five years, and I am proud myself to have been a part of that effort.  Today, I am recommitting the Defense Department to working both with Congress, and on our own, to find new and more creative ways of stretching our defense dollars to give our troops the weapons and equipment they need. The department’s Better Buying Power initiative is now on its third iteration since I established it in 2010, with Better Buying Power 3.0 focused on achieving dominant capabilities through technical excellence.  I know well and very much appreciate the strong support for acquisition reform demonstrated by the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, and their Chairmen, and I share their deep desire to achieve real, lasting results that benefit both America’s security and taxpayers. DoD is working closely with committee Members and staff on ways to eliminate some of the burdensome and duplicative administrative requirements levied on our program managers.  To that end, the President’s FY 2016 budget submission includes a number of legislative proposals designed to help streamline the program oversight process.  We look forward to continuing our close partnership with Congress to see these measures implemented. As we sustain our focus on acquisition reform, I believe that DoD must concurrently undertake a wholesale review of our business practices and management systems. Our goal is to identify where we can further reduce the cost of doing business to free up funding for readiness and modernization – ensuring that our energy, focus, and resources are devoted to supporting our frontline operations as much as possible. We intend to work closely with industry partners – who execute or enable many of our programs, logistics, training, administrative, and other functions – throughout this process, both to explore how they could help us accomplish our missions at reduced cost, and because they may have new and innovative ideas worth considering. Additionally, the Defense Department is pursuing creative force structure changes to be more agile and efficient – such as how we’re modernizing our cruisers and restructuring Army aviation.  We’ve established a new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.  And four previous rounds of efficiency and budget reduction initiatives have yielded approximately $78 billion in projected and actual savings in FY 2016, helping to cushion our defense programs from successive years of budget cuts. We’re also working hard to cut unnecessary overhead: from reducing management headquarters budgets by 20 percent across the department, to divesting excess bases and infrastructure. When DoD recently requested a round of domestic Base Realignment and Closure, Congress asked that we first pursue efficiencies in Europe.  We did.  DoD has approved and is pursuing a broad European Infrastructure Consolidation – which will result in some $500 million in annual recurring savings.  We now need a round of domestic BRAC beginning in Fiscal Year 2017 to address excess infrastructure here at home. Simply put, we have more bases in more places than we need.  We estimate DoD has about 25 percent more infrastructure capacity than necessary.  We must be permitted to divest surplus infrastructure as we reduce and renew force structure.  With projected recurring savings from a new BRAC round totaling some $2 billion a year, it would be irresponsible to cut tooth without also cutting tail. For base communities in question, it’s important to remember that BRAC is often an opportunity to be seized.  Communities have shown that BRAC is ultimately what you make of it, and there are plenty of places that have emerged from it stronger than they were before. Consider Lawrence, Indiana, which took advantage of Fort Harrison’s closure in 1996 to create an enterprise zone, community college, recreational facilities, and commercial sites that in just 7 years not only replaced 100 percent of the jobs lost when the base closed, but created even more. Charleston, South Carolina stepped up when the Charleston Naval Complex closed in 1993, and now is home to more than 80 new industrial and federal agency tenants.  The former naval base is now producing millions of dollars’ worth of goods that are exported to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. And at former Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, the local redevelopment effort has invested $400 million and created more than 6,500 jobs – over six times the number of jobs lost when the base closed in 1993.  It’s now home to scores of businesses, a mixture of private companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. These are just a few examples of what can happen when local leaders, communities, and businesses work together and take advantage of the opportunities for new jobs and new growth after BRAC. One more point on accountability:  Whether we’re improving acquisition or closing bases, it is not enough to simply tell taxpayers that we’re spending their dollars responsibly.  We have to also show them, which is why good cost accounting and financial auditability is so important to me. DoD has made significant progress over the past five years in adding more discipline to our business environment, but there is much work left to be done, and we remain fully committed to our current audit goals. Today, over 90 percent of DoD’s current year, general fund budgetary resources are under some form of financial audit, with the military services all involved and following the model employed by the Marine Corps. We plan to submit every corner of DoD to this kind of audit regimen beginning in FY 2016.  With this foundation, the department will progressively expand the scope of these audits until all our organizations, funds, and financial statements will be under audit in FY 2018, complying with Congress’s statutory direction to be audit ready by the end of FY 2017. There’s a reason why auditing is a basic practice as ancient as the Domesday Book, and it is time that DoD finally lives up to its moral and legal obligation to be accountable to those who pay its bills.  I intend to do everything we can – including holding people to account – to get this done. Competitiveness through Attracting Future Talent Third, but no less important, DoD must be competitive when it comes to attracting new generations of talented and dedicated Americans to our calling of defending the nation. We know how the attacks of September 11th, 2001 motivated so many Americans to want to be part of this noble endeavor.  Going forward, we must ensure our future force can continue to recruit the finest young men and women our country has to offer – military and civilian – like those who serve today. As we do this, we must be mindful that the next generation expects jobs that give them purpose, meaning, and dignity.  They want to be able to make real contributions, have their voices heard, and gain valuable and transferable experience.  We must shape the kind of force they want to be in.  The battle for talent will demand enlightened and agile leaders, new training schemes, new educational opportunities, and new compensation approaches. DoD is already pursuing several initiatives that will help ensure the military is a compelling career option.  In recent years, we’ve been expanding pilot programs that facilitate breaks in service that let our people gain diverse work experience.  We’ve tailored our transition assistance program, Transition GPS, to better prepare servicemembers to enter the civilian workforce – providing different tracks for those who want to go to college, those who want skills training, and those who want to be entrepreneurs.  And we’ve put a renewed focus on military ethics and professionalism, as well as making sure our military health system is held to the same high-quality standards we expect from the servicemembers and military family members under its care. Because we know how important it is – both for today’s servicemembers and the generation that will follow them – we’re also deeply committed to creating an environment and culture where we live the values we defend and every servicemember is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. That’s why we’re continuing to expand combat positions available to women – because everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country should have full and equal opportunity to do so. It’s why we’re striving to eliminate sexual assault from the military. And it’s why we’ve been making sure gay and lesbian servicemembers can serve openly, and that their families receive the benefits their loved ones have earned. But for everything we’re doing, DoD cannot build the force of the future by ourselves.  We need Congress’s help. What We Need Congress To Do Since our current defense budget drawdown began several years ago, I’ve observed something of a phenomenon here in Washington. Along with our troops, their families, and our defense civilians, I thank our supporters on Capitol Hill, including most members of this committee, who have joined with us in trying to do everything possible to get Congress to prevent more mindless cuts to our defense budget. Unfortunately, these combined efforts have been unsuccessful in actually restoring adequate and predictable resources for DoD.  We have had to endure deep cuts to readiness, weather pay freezes and civilian furloughs, and cut badly needed investments in modernization and critical technologies.  At the same time, Congress has sometimes sought to protect programs that DoD has argued are no longer needed, or require significant reform. We have had the worst of both worlds – a double whammy of mindless sequestration coupled with inability to reform. As many of you know, it wasn’t always this way. During the defense drawdown after the Cold War, DoD had much more flexibility thanks to the help of Congress.  For example, we were able to resize the Army, retire the A-6 Intruder and many other weapons systems, and implement multiple BRAC rounds, which freed up dollars we re-allocated to keep our force structure ready, capable, and deployable around the world. I know some of the changes and reforms we’re proposing may feel like a significant change from how we currently do business.  But if anyone can understand how the dots connect and how we need Congress’s help to be able to defend our country, our allies, and our interests in an increasingly dangerous world, it’s you – the members of this committee. The fact is, if we’re not able to implement the changes and reforms we need, we will be forced to make painful tradeoffs, even at the higher topline the President is requesting.  We will lose further ground on modernization and readiness – leaving tomorrow’s force less capable and leaving our nation less secure.  And we will face significant hurdles to executing our nation’s defense strategy.  That’s why we need your help.  III. THE PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET As we do every year when formulating our budget, this budget seeks to balance readiness, capability, and size – because we must ensure that, whatever the size of our force, we have the resources to provide every servicemember with the right training, the right equipment, the right compensation, and the right quality of fellow troops.  That is the only way we can ensure our military is fully prepared to accomplish its missions. Almost two-thirds of DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 base budget – $348.4 billion – funds our day-to-day expenses, similar to what a business would call its operating budget.  This covers, among other expenses, the cost of fuel, spare parts, logistics support, maintenance, service contracts, and administration.  It also includes pay and benefits for military and civilian personnel, which by themselves comprise nearly half of our total budget. The remaining third of our base budget – $185.9 billion – comprises investments in future defense needs, much like a business’ capital improvement budget.  It pays for the research, development, testing, evaluation, and ultimately acquisition of the weapons, equipment, and facilities that our servicemembers need. Broken down differently, our base budget includes the following categories:  Modernization What makes this budget different is the focus it puts, more so than any other over the last decade, on new funding for modernization.  After years of war, which required the deferral of longer-term modernization investments, this budget puts renewed emphasis on preparing for future threats – especially threats that challenge our military’s power projection capabilities. Threats to Power Projection and our Technological Edge Being able to project power anywhere across the globe by rapidly surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies lies at the core of our defense strategy and what the American people have come to expect of their military.  It guarantees that when an acute crisis erupts anywhere in the world, America can provide aid when disaster strikes, reinforce our allies when they are threatened, and protect our citizens and interests globally.  It also assures freedom of navigation and overflight, and allows global commerce to flow freely. For decades, U.S. global power projection has relied on the ships, planes, submarines, bases, aircraft carriers, satellites, networks, and other advanced capabilities that comprise our military’s unrivaled technological edge.  But today that superiority is being challenged in unprecedented ways. Advanced military technologies, from rockets and drones to chemical and biological capabilities, have found their way into the arsenals of both non-state actors as well as previously less capable militaries.  And other nations – among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea – have been pursuing long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap that has long existed between them and the United States. These modernization programs are developing and fielding advanced aircraft, submarines, and both longer-range and more accurate ballistic and cruise missiles.  They’re developing new and advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles, as well as new counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities.  In some areas, we see levels of new weapons development that we haven’t seen since the mid-1980s, near the peak of the Soviet Union’s surge in Cold War defense spending. Targeted Investments in the President’s Budget One of the reasons we are asking for more money this year than last year is to reverse recent under-investment in new weapons systems by making targeted investments to help us stay ahead of emerging threats – adding substantial funding for space control and launch capabilities, missile defense, cyber, and advanced sensors, communications, and munitions – all of which are critical for power projection in contested environments. The budget also makes significant investments in the resilience and survivability of our infrastructure and forces, particularly in the western Pacific, with improved active defenses such as our Patriot and AEGIS systems, as well as selective hardening of key installations and facilities. DoD is also addressing the erosion of U.S. technological superiority with the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII).  The DII is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century. The DII will identify, develop, and field breakthrough technologies and systems through a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program, and the President’s budget supports this effort through specific investments in promising new technologies and capabilities such as high-speed strike weapons, advanced aeronautics, rail guns, and high energy lasers.  The DII also involves the development of innovative operational concepts that would help us use our current capabilities in new and creative ways.  The ultimate aim is to help craft ‘offset strategies’ that maximize our strengths and exploit the weaknesses of potential adversaries. Our budget is also making focused and sustained investments in modernization and manning across the nuclear enterprise, even as we reduce the roles and numbers of nuclear weapons in the U.S. nuclear posture.  These investments are critical for ensuring the continued safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, as well as the long-term health of the force that supports our nuclear triad, particularly after recent troubling lapses in parts of DoD’s nuclear enterprise.  To help fund improvements across the nuclear enterprise, we are requesting an increase of approximately $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016, and about $8 billion over the FYDP. Readiness DoD must rebuild and recover after more than 13 years of uninterrupted war.  But our effort to do so has been frustrated by two variables, both of which are out of our hands – one, the continued high operational tempo and high demand for our forces, and two, the uncertainty surrounding annual appropriations. Only over the last couple of years has readiness begun to recover from the strains of over a decade of war, exacerbated by sequestration in 2013.  Nevertheless, readiness remains at troubling levels across the force. While our forward-deployed forces remain ready, our surge forces at home are not as ready as they need to be.  The President’s budget therefore invests in near-term unit readiness by adjusting service end-strength ramps to reduce personnel turbulence and stress on the force, while increasing funding to improve home station training and training-related infrastructure. This past year has demonstrated that our military must be ready to fight more than just the last war.  We have to be prepared across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and in cyberspace – to engage in both low- and high-end missions and conflicts, as well as in the shadowy, so-called ‘hybrid warfare’ space in between. While this budget submission’s requested and projected funding levels will enable the military to continue making steady progress toward full-spectrum combat readiness, the gains we’ve recently made are fragile.  Sustaining them to provide for ready and capable forces will require both time and a stable flow of resources, which is why, even under the budget we’re requesting, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps won’t all reach their readiness goals until 2020, and the Air Force won’t do so until 2023. Army: For Fiscal Year 2016, the Army’s base budget of $126.5 billion supports an end-strength of 1,015,000 soldiers – 475,000 soldiers on active duty, 342,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 198,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 57 total force brigade combat teams and associated enablers.  The budget also supports 19 brigade-level training rotations at the Army’s Combat Training Centers, which are critical to the Army’s efforts to reach full-spectrum combat readiness. While the Army’s postwar end-strength target remains a force of approximately 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers and 195,000 Army Reserve soldiers, this year’s budget slows the drawdown rate.  Rather than planning to reduce the active-duty force by 20,000 soldiers and the National Guard by 14,000 soldiers in Fiscal Year 2016, the Army will instead plan to reduce by 15,000 active-duty soldiers and 8,000 Guardsmen, while still maintaining its schedule for reducing unit structure.  This will help mitigate personnel turbulence and stress, while also improving unit manning as the Army approaches its target size. The Army’s budget for Fiscal Year 2016 also includes $4.5 billion for Army helicopter modernization.  Specifically:  These investments require difficult trade-offs given today’s constrained fiscal environment.  That is why the Army is resubmitting the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative, which makes the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars by retiring outdated airframes and streamlining the Army’s helicopter fleet so that platforms can be modernized and allocated where they are needed most. As you know, I am committed to reviewing the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative.  However, the Army believes that fully implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which includes shifting National Guard Apaches to active-duty units while providing Guard units with Black Hawks, is prudent for several reasons. For one, Apaches are in high demand at high levels of readiness that would require Guard units manning them to mobilize at unprecedentedly high rates; or alternatively, for the Army to spend a total of approximately $4.4 billion to fully equip the Guard’s Apache battalions, and then $350 million per year to maintain them at those high levels of readiness.  Meanwhile, Black Hawks are more suitable for Guard missions here at home.  Whether homeland defense, disaster relief, support to civil authorities, or complementing our active-duty military, these missions tend to demand transport and medical capabilities more than the attack capabilities of Apaches.  In sum, the initiative avoids approximately $12 billion in costs through Fiscal Year 2035 and saves over $1 billion annually starting in Fiscal Year 2020.  Considering these figures, implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative is not only in the best warfighting interest of the Army, but also in the interest of the taxpayers who fund it. I know this is a contentious issue.  However, we believe the ARI is the least cost, best solution for the Army’s aviation enterprise.  DoD looks forward to making its case to the National Commission on the Future of the Army established by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Navy & Marine Corps: The Navy and Marine Corps are allocated $161 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a 282-ship fleet in 2016 and a 304-ship fleet by Fiscal Year 2020 with a return to 11 aircraft carriers, 386,600 active-duty and Reserve sailors, and 222,900 active-duty and Reserve Marines. The President’s budget invests $16.6 billion in shipbuilding for Fiscal Year 2016, and $95.9 billion over the FYDP.  The budget protects critical Navy and Marine Corps investments in undersea, surface, amphibious, and airborne capabilities – all of which are critical for addressing emerging threats.  Specifically:  Making these investments while also abiding by fiscal prudence, we had to make more difficult trade-offs.  For that reason, we are resubmitting our request to place some of the Navy’s cruisers and an amphibious landing ship – 12 ships in total, including 11 cruisers – into a phased modernization program that will provide them with enhanced capability and a longer lifespan.  Given that our cruisers are the most capable ships for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and in light of anti-ship missile capabilities being pursued by other nations, this modernization program will, over the next decade and a half, be a baseline requirement for sustaining both our cruiser fleet and 11 carrier strike groups through 2045. I acknowledge and appreciate the plan put forward in the omnibus Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, which helps us get to our goal, and which we have begun to implement.  However, this plan is more expensive, and results in shorter ship life.  Considering that our plan is critical for our power projection capabilities, we believe it should be implemented in full, and look forward to working with the Congress as we move forward. Air Force: The Air Force is allocated a base budget of $152.9 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a force of 491,700 active-duty, Guard, and Reserve airmen, 49 tactical fighter squadrons, 96 operational bombers out of a total 154-aircraft bomber fleet, and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that includes 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Air Force’s budget reflects DoD’s decision to protect modernization funding for advanced capabilities and platforms most relevant to both present and emerging threats – in this case, fifth-generation fighters, long-range bombers, and mid-air refueling aircraft to assure our air superiority and global reach; both manned and remotely-piloted aircraft to help meet Combatant Commanders’ needs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and research and development to ensure continued and competitive space launch capabilities.  Specifically:  In light of high demand coupled with Congressional consultations, the Air Force budget reflects DoD’s decision to slow the retirement timelines for three key ISR and battle management platforms. We chose to defer the retirement of the U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft until Fiscal Year 2019, when planned sensor upgrades to the RQ-4 Global Hawk will combine with other capabilities to mitigate the loss of the U-2.  We chose to delay the previously planned retirement of seven E-3 Sentry AWACS until Fiscal Year 2019, so they can support air operations over Iraq and Syria.  And we chose to delay retirement of any E-8 JSTARS through Fiscal Year 2020, pending final approval of the Air Force’s acquisition strategy for its replacement. The Air Force budget also supports a timeline that would phase out and retire the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2019.  With the gradual retirement of the A-10 that we’re proposing, the Air Force will better support legacy fleet readiness and the planned schedule for standing up the F-35A by filling in some of the overall fighter maintenance personnel shortfalls with trained and qualified personnel from the retiring A-10 squadrons. As you know, F-35 maintainer demand has already required the Air Force to use the authority Congress provided last year to move some A-10s into back-up aircraft inventory status.  I should note that the Air Force is doing so only to the extent that it absolutely must, and so far intends to move far fewer A-10s into this status than what Congress has authorized.  I know this is an important issue, and DoD looks forward to working with you on it. Defense-Wide: The remaining share of our base budget – about $94 billion – is allocated across the Department of Defense.  This includes funding for cyber, U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Health Agency, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and missile defense. For Fiscal Year 2016, a $9.6 billion total investment in missile defense helps protect the U.S. homeland, deployed forces, and our allies and partners.  This includes $8.1 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, $1.6 billion of which will help ensure the reliability of U.S. ground-based interceptors, which are currently sited at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  The budget also continues to support the President’s timeline for implementing the European Phased Adaptive Approach. Overseas Contingency Operations: Separate from DoD’s base budget, we are also requesting $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Fiscal Year 2016.  This represents a 21 percent decrease from last year’s $64.2 billion in OCO funding, continuing OCO’s decline since 2010, while also reflecting continued operational demands on U.S. forces around the world.  OCO comprises funding for:  The conclusion of major combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has resulted in a 73 percent drop in DoD’s OCO costs from their $187-billion peak in Fiscal Year 2008. We are continuing to use OCO as appropriate to finance our military’s response to unforeseen crises, but we must also account for those enduring priorities that we do not envision going away – such as supporting our Afghan partners, countering terrorism, maintaining a strong forward presence in the Middle East, and ensuring our military is ready to respond to a wide range of potential crises. The Administration intends to transition OCO’s enduring costs to the base budget between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2020.  We will do this over time, and in a way that protects our defense strategy – including DoD’s abilities to deter aggression, maintain crisis-ready forces, and project power across the globe.  This transition, however, will not be possible unless the threat of sequestration has been removed. Having financed the costs of key military activities – such as counterterrorism operations and our Middle East posture – outside the base budget for 14 years, and knowing that the security situation in the Middle East remains volatile, it will take time to determine which OCO costs are most likely to be enduring, and which are not.  But we will release a plan later this year, which will also address how we will budget for uncertainty surrounding unforeseen future crises, and implications for DoD’s budget.  IV. COMPENSATION The choices we face about military compensation are vexing, critically important, and closely followed, so I want to be direct and upfront with you. When our troops go into battle – risking their lives – we owe to them, and their families, not only adequate pay and compensation, but also the right investments – in the right people, the right training, and the right weapons and equipment – so that they can accomplish their missions and come home safely. To meet all of these obligations at once, we have to balance how we allocate our dollars.  It would be irresponsible to prioritize compensation, force size, equipment, or training in isolation, only to put our servicemembers’ lives at unacceptable risk in battle. For the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget, the Defense Department considered its compensation proposals very carefully, as well as those approved by Congress in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.  Accordingly, this budget again proposes modest adjustments to shift funds from compensation into readiness, capability, and force structure, so that our people can continue executing their missions with continued excellence. As you know, the Congressionally-commissioned Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission has recently released its own compensation proposals.  Their work, which DoD is continuing to analyze, shows thoughtfulness and good intent, which we deeply appreciate. Given that this hearing is being held before the department has submitted its recommendations on the commission’s report to President Obama, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss them at this time.  Many of these proposals would significantly affect our servicemembers and their families, and DoD owes them, the President, and the country our utmost diligence and most rigorous analysis. However, I can say that the department agrees with the overarching goals of the commission, especially providing servicemembers and beneficiaries more options – whether in preparing for retirement or in making health care choices. I can also say that the commission’s proposals are complicated, and do not lend themselves to binary answers.  Therefore, when we provide the President with our recommendations on each proposal, DoD will clarify not simply whether we support each proposal, but also where we recommend specific modifications to improve or enable us to fully support a given proposal. We believe there is something positive in almost every one of the commission’s recommendations, and that they present a great opportunity to ensure we honor our servicemembers past, present, and future.  I look forward to Congress’s support and partnership as we work hard to take advantage of it.  V. IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION At the end of 2013, policymakers came together on a bipartisan basis to partially reverse sequestration and pay for higher discretionary funding levels with long-term reforms.  We’ve seen how that bipartisan agreement has allowed us to invest in areas ranging from research and manufacturing to strengthening our military.  We’ve also seen the positive impact on our economy, with a more responsible and orderly budget process helping contribute to the fastest job growth since the late 1990s. The President’s budget builds on this progress by reversing sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closures, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy.  The President has also made clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. As the Joint Chiefs and others have outlined, and as I will detail in this testimony, sequestration would damage our national security, ultimately resulting in a military that is too small and insufficiently equipped to fully implement our defense strategy.  This would reflect poorly on America’s global leadership, which has been the one critical but defining constant in a turbulent and dangerous world.  In fact, even the threat of sequestration has had real effects. You don’t need me to tell you that the President has said he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security.  Why?  Because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military depends on a strong educational system, thriving private-sector businesses, and innovative research.  And because that principle – matching defense increases with non-defense increases dollar-for-dollar – was a basic condition of the bipartisan agreement we got in 2013.  The President sees no reason why we shouldn’t uphold those same principles in any agreement now. The only way we’re going to get out of the wilderness of sequestration is if we work together.  I therefore appeal to members of Congress, from both parties, to start looking for ways to find a truly bipartisan compromise.  I hope they can make clear to their colleagues that sequestration would also damage America’s long-term strength, preventing our country from making pro-growth investments in areas ranging from basic research to early childhood education – investments that, in the past, have helped make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Sequestration is set to return in just over 200 days.  Letting that happen would be unwise and unsafe for our national defense, over both the short and long term. Short-Term Impact DoD has had to live with uncertain budgets for the last three years, continuous and sudden downward revisions of our budget plans, and even a government closure.  To continue meeting all of our mission requirements, we’ve done our best to manage through these circumstances, underfunding significant parts of our force and its support systems.  Put bluntly, we have survived, but not thrived.  Our military has made painful choices and tradeoffs among the size, capabilities, and readiness of our joint force, and we’ve amassed a number of bills that are now coming due. That’s why the department has been counting on and planning for a budget increase of roughly $35 billion above sequestration-level caps in Fiscal Year 2016.  If it looks like DoD will be operating at sequestration levels in 2016, on October 1 we will have to swiftly begin making cuts so that we don’t end up $35 billion short as we approach year’s end. A return to sequestration in Fiscal Year 2016 would affect all aspects of the department, but not all equally. More than one-third of the Fiscal Year 2016 cuts would come have to come from Operations and Maintenance accounts, with unavoidable reductions in readiness and our ability to shape world events in America’s interest.  Let me put this more plainly:  allowing sequestration to return would deprive our troops of what they need to accomplish their missions. Approximately half of the cuts would have to come from the department’s modernization accounts, undermining our efforts to secure technological superiority for U.S. forces in future conflicts.  Because there are bills that DoD absolutely must pay – such as the salaries of our troops – many capabilities being developed to counter known threats from highly capable adversaries would be delayed or cancelled, deepening our nation’s vulnerabilities at a time when the world is growing more dangerous, not less.  Sequestration would put a hold on critical programs like our Aerospace Innovation Initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Engine, the Ground-Based Interceptor missile defense kill vehicle redesign, and several space control efforts. Deferring these investments is bad policy and makes the Defense Department less competitive for the future.  What’s more, it breaks faith with the troops of today and the troops of tomorrow.  And it undermines the defense industrial base that is a critical foundation for our national security. Long-Term Impact If sequestration were to persist over time, the long-term consequences would be harder hitting.  We would ultimately have a military that looks fundamentally different, and that performs much differently, from what our nation is accustomed to. If we are forced to sequestration-level budgets, I do not believe that we can continue to make incremental cuts and maintain the same general set of objectives as we’ve had in our defense strategy.  I will insist that new cuts be accompanied by a frank reassessment of our strategic approach to addressing the threats we face around the world – what we are asking the Armed Forces to do and to be prepared to do. I cannot tell you right now exactly what that means – DoD is not resigned to the return of sequestration – but I can tell you that I will direct the department to look at all aspects of the defense budget to determine how best to absorb these cuts.  No portion of our budget can remain inviolate. What I will not do is let DoD continue mortgaging our future readiness and capability.  I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, and ineffective doctrine. Everything else is on the table. What does that mean?  We could be forced to consider pay cuts, not just cuts in the growth of compensation.  We could be forced to consider all means of shedding excess infrastructure, not just working within the Congressional BRAC process.  We could be forced to look at significant force structure cuts, not just trimming around the edges.  We could be forced to ask our military to do – and be prepared to do – significantly less than what we have traditionally expected, and required of it. I am not afraid to ask these difficult questions, but if we are stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. A prolonged period of depressed defense budgets will almost certainly mean a smaller, less capable, and less ready military.  No one can fully predict the impact on the future.  But it could translate into future conflicts that last longer, and are more costly in both lives and dollars. That may sound severe to some, but it is a fact, and history should be our guide when we think about the true cost of sequestration. The Case for Repealing Sequestration I know I’m preaching to the choir here.  If sequestration could have been reversed by just this committee and its counterpart in the Senate, it probably would have happened years ago.  So I offer the following to Members of the Committee about what you can remind your colleagues when you ask for their vote to repeal sequestration: Remind them that even after the increase we’re asking for, DoD’s budget as a share of total federal spending will still be at a near-historic low – a quarter of what it was during the Korean War, a third of what it was during the Vietnam War, and half of what it was during the Reagan buildup. Remind them that the increased funding is for modernization that’s critical to keeping our military’s technological edge and staying ahead of potential adversaries. Remind them that DoD has hands-on leadership from the very top – me – devoted to using taxpayer dollars better than they’ve been used in the past.  You have my personal commitment to greater accountability, greater efficiency, and running this department better and leaner than before. Remind them that sequestration’s cuts to long-term investments will likely make those investments more costly down the line.  All who bemoan unnecessary Pentagon program delays and the associated cost overruns should know that sequestration will only make these problems worse.  I can easily sympathize with my non-defense counterparts in this regard; knowing how wasteful and inefficient sequestration would be at DoD, I have no doubt the same is true at other departments and agencies as well. Remind them that sequestration’s impact on our domestic budget will cause further long-term damage to our defense – because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military needs strong schools to provide the best people, strong businesses to provide the best weapons and equipment, and strong science and research sectors to provide the best new innovations and technologies. Remind them that we can’t keep kicking this can down the road.  The more we prolong tough decisions, the more difficult and more costly they will be later on.  VI. CONCLUSION The men and women of the Department of Defense are counting on Congress to help assure the strength of our military and American global leadership at a time of great change in the world. We must reverse the decline in defense budgets to execute our strategy and fund a modern, ready, leaner force in a balanced way.  We must seize the opportunity to enact necessary reforms in how we do business.  And we must bring an end to the threat sequestration poses to the future of our force and American credibility around the world. As you evaluate the President’s budget submission, I encourage you and your colleagues to keep it in perspective. In the years since the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 budget request – the benchmark for cuts prescribed under the 2011 Budget Control Act – DoD’s 10-year budget projections have absorbed more than $750 billion in cuts, or more than three-quarters of the trillion-dollar cuts that would be required should sequestration be allowed to run its course.  And while some claim this is our biggest budget ever, the fact is, as a share of total federal spending, DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget is at a near-historic low – representing about 14 percent of total federal discretionary and non-discretionary outlays.  DoD’s total budget remains more than $100 billion below what it was at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was even more complicated than we could have foreseen.  Given today’s security environment – which has over 200,000 American servicemembers stationed in over 130 countries conducting nearly 60 named operations – our proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is a responsible, prudent approach. Some of you may recall how, in 1991, after America’s Cold War victory and amid doubts about America’s engagement with the world and calls for a bigger domestic peace dividend, a bipartisan group in Congress stepped forward to help shape America’ global leadership and make long-term decisions from which we continue to benefit. Senators Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar helped craft, pass, and pay for the small Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that allowed the United States and DoD to provide the funding and expertise to help former Soviet states decommission their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles. The Nunn-Lugar program was initially opposed abroad, and there were also doubts at the Pentagon about whether we could implement it without losing track of funding.  I know.  I helped lead the program in its early years.  But with slow and diligent effort by American defense officials, the Congress, and our foreign partners, it worked. It helped prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands.  It helped establish a pattern of international cooperation and global norms in the post-Cold War international order.  And, in the light of the current instability in Ukraine, it might have staved off several variants of nuclear disaster. But it also set an important precedent for our work on this budget and in the years ahead.  It shows what Congressional conviction – especially when it is bipartisan – can accomplish in foreign policy.  It shows the value of foresight and planning for an uncertain future.  And it shows how spending a relatively few dollars today can generate huge value down the line. As the new Secretary of Defense, I hope it will be possible to again unite behind what our great nation should do to protect our people and make a better world, and provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they deserve. Thank you.

"Nov. 13, 2015","Good morning, General Milley, Acting Secretary Fanning, to senior leaders of the Department, civilian and military, and especially, to the Medal of Honor recipients here today, it’s an honor to have you all with us. I want express at the beginning my particular appreciation for Captain Groberg’s parents.  Larry and Klara, though you raised your son in different places across the country, around the world, you instilled in him an abiding sense of service, you developed in him an unbounded sense of honor. And if you listen closely to what Flo has said, you’ll get a sense that one person above all developed his toughness.  Of course, that’s his mother Klara.  So when Army officials explained he would be sent to San Antonio for his rehabilitation rather than closer to home, she knows what’s coming, Captain Groberg had to make one thing clear and this is a quote form him:  “If you thought the enemy was bad in Afghanistan,” he told them, “Wait until my mother finds out you’re sending me to Texas.” Ultimately…the Army thought better of it, sending Captain Groberg to Walter Reed, where he received world-class care over nearly three years of intensive rehabilitation.  In our visits to Walter Reed in the past few years, my wife Stephanie and I have so often been impressed by the quality of the care there.  And of course, what impresses us most – what truly inspires us there – is the spirit and resilience of our warriors there, warriors like Captain Florent Groberg, who against all odds, can stand with us today. And I want to thank the members of Captain Groberg’s extended family, his military family, men who were his brothers on the battlefield who remained close to him in recovery. From Platoon Sergeant Brian Brink, who carried Captain Groberg to safety, to Specialist Daniel Balderrama, who immediately treated his life-threatening wounds, to Sergeant Andrew Mahoney who helped confront the suicide bomber, to Private First Class Ben Secor and Eric Ochart, who carried members of the team to safety, each of you helped save lives.  You not only witnessed Captain Groberg’s courageous decisions, you contributed to them.  In so many ways, you were the reason he made them. I’ve made many visits to Afghanistan over the past several years -- enough to understand that the mountains and valleys in the country’s northeast where Captain Groberg and his team patrolled in 2012 were a forbidding frontier.  So while the medal is received by one; honor, courage, and valor were required by all. And above all – and as Captain Groberg has so often emphasized – we have a duty to honor those who can be with us only in spirit and memory.  To the families of those who gave their lives serving with Captain Groberg, here also, Command Sergeant Major Kevin Griffin, Major Thomas Kennedy, Air Force Major Walter Gray, and Ragaei Abdelfattah, you have our deepest sympathy and appreciation. Try as we may, and try as we do, we can never fully know the weight of your loss.  But we do know – we fully know – what your loved ones’ sacrifice mean to this country and those they served alongside. Honoring and remembering the fallen is part of our sacred trust.  And so too is honoring the exceptional courage of those who survived them, those who carry forward their memory by living among us. As we reflect today upon those fateful moments in Kunar Province, we can clearly see how Captain Groberg went above and beyond the call of duty.  As it reads on Captain Groberg’s Medal of Honor Citation – and as it is written on every Medal of Honor Citation – “he distinguished himself conspicuously by his gallantry.” We also see how Captain Groberg’s courage stood in stark contrast to the cowardice of the suicide bomber he confronted.  While this enemy was willing to die so he could harm others, Captain Groberg was willing to risk his life to save others.  While the enemy was motivated by self-delusion, Captain Groberg was driven by selfless service.  And while the enemy was sent to his death by a movement that cares nothing for life, Captain Groberg was standing for the great values of the greatest nation as one of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  He was rescued by brothers who put themselves in danger, refusing to leave him behind.  In that moment of testing, we learned about Captain Groberg's courage, but also his character, which defines the American soldier. While we reflect upon what made Captain Groberg’s actions so truly exceptional, we should also remember all that he shares with so many from his generation.  Over 14 years of war, whether in Kunar or Korengal, in Baghdad or Basra, hundreds of thousands of Captain Groberg’s peers have served with honor, courage, and excellence.  Each of our lives – and the life of this nation – is richer because of their example. In becoming the 10th living American to receive the Medal of Honor for his service in Afghanistan, Captain Groberg embodies the highest values of these Americans – men and women who came of age in the shadow of the 9/11 attacks. He attended high school just a short drive from where we stand today -- graduating in the same year this building and our nation were attacked. It was a far different time then and in so many ways, Flo was a different person.  As President Obama noted yesterday, Flo’s coaches from high school and college recall one particular aspect of his character that would endure.  They remember that it wasn’t Flo’s performance in individual races and events where he showed his greatest potential, though that was great.  It was when he ran with the baton and passed it forward – it was as a member of a relay team -- where he proved his great determination. And what was true on the track was true for Flo when he considered a career.  After graduating from college, he held a couple of different jobs, but none inspired him.  It was only when Flo found a team where he could make a difference, when he found the Army, that he discovered both his career and a calling.  And for Flo, there was reason why committing to the U.S. Army would’ve meant more to him than some others.  Even before he could wear the uniform, he had to make a significant sacrifice; he had to make a conscious choice to leave the French citizenship of his birth behind. Yesterday, when President Obama placed the blue ribbon around his neck at the White House, Captain Groberg became the first foreign-born recipient of the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War.  But if you study the biographies of the nearly 3,500 Medal of Honor Recipients, you will find that Captain Groberg follows in the footsteps of a long line of heroes – heroes who gave up important ties to the past to fight for America’s future.  Captain Groberg has joined more than 20%, as it turns out, of all Medal of Honor Recipients who were born on foreign shores. So Captain Groberg chose to commit himself completely to this country; he chose repeatedly to lead his fellow soldiers with excellence; he chose to test himself against the absolute best, earning the Ranger tab.  And at the moment of greatest testing, he made the most selfless and courageous choice of all: to run toward the direction of danger; to willingly put his life on the line for the sake of his brothers. It is because our service members make these courageous choices – both in this time and across generations – that we have the chance to be free. And as we consider the more than 3,400 names and 150 years of history chronicled in the Hall of Heroes, we begin to appreciate something Captain Groberg learned long ago:  It is not in a single sprint, or even a test of our individual endurance, where we show our true strength.  As a nation, we derive our greatest strength from how each of us carries the baton forward; from how Americans in each generation pass the torch of freedom onward. As the Roman historian Tacitus wrote nearly 2,000 years ago: “In Valor there is Hope.”  So as we honor Captain Groberg’s valor today, we too have hope –that the liberty and security we enjoy today will be passed forward to future generations. Thank you Captain Groberg for your courageous actions, for your example, and for your exceptional service to our nation.

"June 10, 2016","Thanks very much, Kevin. Thanks for having me here, for organizing what is really an extraordinary gathering. And for riding on the airplane with me all over the world, which we do. I very much appreciate that, admire your work. And I want to thank all of you - all of you attendees here and participants from what is America’s wonderfully innovative, open technology community, which is one of our country’s greatest strengths. I am committed to building and rebuilding the bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and innovators throughout the nation, from the tech innovators in Silicon Valley, yes, but to many, many other hubs and places around the country. I've visited Silicon Valley four times as Secretary of Defense. But a week before last, was up with the submarine engineers I met with last month at Electric Boat in Connecticut. So it's very widespread. It's the pride of the country and it's the strength of the country, our entire technology base. And as we continue building these bridges, I’m also focused on promoting the great innovators who are within our Department, at our labs, in our schools, and on the battlefield. You heard from some of them today, our many of our senior leaders involved in both of these critical and interconnected missions. Alongside the many technology, business and academic leaders who’ve joined the discussion today, they play a critical role in accelerating the spirit of innovation that we need to maintain our edge in a complex and changing world. So what I wanted to do is describe the logic of my commitment to this agenda and the actions we are taking to pursue it, and describe how these efforts – and the continued creativity and engagement of so many of you - will enable us to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. Now, when I began my career, as Kevin pointed out, in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  Now today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is global, and the technology base is commercial. Indeed, today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating in its own right. We have today, as you all know, no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving  challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and confronting terrorism, including accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and wherever it metastasizes in places such as Afghanistan and North Africa.  And since, moreover, we have a pretty good record of never predicting the successfully the strategic future, we must also be flexible and agile in preparing for it, for unknowns that we can’t anticipate today. So in the Department of Defense, we don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges, or between acting in the present and investing in the future.  So we have to accommodate both these changes in the technological landscape and changes in our strategic landscape. We have to do it all. To stay ahead of those challenges, and stay the best, I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box, and invest aggressively in innovation…from innovative technologies, to innovative practices, to innovative people. And let me address each of those in turn. First, we're investing aggressively in high-end innovative technologies to enhance our own asymmetric and hybrid capabilities. Overall, our budget invests nearly $72 billion in R&D. Now, to give you a little context, that's more than double what Apple, Intel and Google spent on R&D last year combined. That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in our dozens of DOD labs and engineering centers across the country, as you just heard about from Mary Miller.  It also includes investments in work happening in innovative companies and at universities, and at DARPA to develop and advance some of the disruptive technologies and capabilities that Steve Walker talked about with you earlier today. We’re making groundbreaking advances in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing. Those funds also support our growing nationwide network of public-private Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, where we’re working with companies, universities, and research labs to fund technologies like 3D-printing, advanced materials, integrated photonics, and digital manufacturing and design.  We announced the newest one earlier this spring, which is focused on revolutionary textiles that combine fibers with electronics to create fabrics that can sense, communicate, store energy, monitor health, change color, and much more.  Another we announced last fall is focused on flexible hybrid electronics…which makes it possible to shape lightweight, flexible structural integrity sensors right onto ships, bridges, cars, aircraft, and so on. And meanwhile, we’re also investing to continue to make DoD a leader in innovation and investment in cybersecurity.  The Department of Defense has three missions in cyberspace.  First, our highest priority is defending our networks and weapon systems. That’s  job one – they’re no good if they’ve been hacked.  Our second mission is to help our partners across the government defend the nation against cyberattacks from abroad.  And the third mission is to provide offensive cyber options that can be used in a conflict, as we’re doing now against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. In our latest defense budget, we’re investing more in all three of these missions, a total of $35 billion dollars over the next five years – with a great deal of that to help modernize and secure DoD’s hundreds of networks.  And all the while, we’re continuing to push forward new breakthroughs in cyber technology, like creating network defenses that can swiftly adapt to threats and self-patch practically in real time. Now, technical innovation and investment is necessary, but not sufficient – we have to pursue innovative practices and organizational structures, also.  The world we live in demands it.  While the Cold War arms race was characterized by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, today’s era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than anyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy.  What also matters, it matters a lot, is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to use them in different and innovative ways, all this to stay ahead of future threats. Our DoD labs and engineering centers are embracing new methods and practices to meet the needs of the warfighter faster, more efficiently and more effectively. We have encouraged this  - I’ve encouraged this - through persistent reforms such as Better Buying Power 3.0. Six years ago when I was Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, DoD began what I called Better Buying Power, an initiative to continuously improve our acquisition system.  And under the current Undersecretary, Frank Kendall, we’re now on the third iteration, Better Buying Power 3.0, focused on reducing cost growth and cycle time through greater use of prototypes, modular open systems and open architectures, and on accelerating the‎ integration of commercial technologies. It all comes down to meeting the needs of the warfighter faster, more efficiently, more effectively in what is an intensely competitive world. This is a particular focus of DoD’s Strategic Capabilities Office, which you heard about from Will Roper a brief time ago. I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense, I did that to help re-imagine existing systems in our inventory by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound our enemies.  We're building fast - I think he may have mentioned this - resilient microdrones that can be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach .9 in heavy winds. We're developing an arsenal plane, which will function as a very large airborne magazine with different conventional payloads, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensors and targeting nodes.  And these are just a couple of examples of what Will’s shop is doing – stay tuned. To stay innovative going forward, DoD has to continue to be open to new ideas and new partnerships.  That’s why we’ve embarked on initiatives like our start-up in Silicon Valley, the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx.  I was there last month to announce that we’re iterating, and taking this effort to the next level by launching DIUx 2.0, if you like, with several new features.  First of all, it’s a nationwide release, with a second DIUx office to be located in Boston – you’ll hear more about that in July.  It has more processing power, since our budget request includes $30 million dollars in new funding to direct toward non-traditional companies with emerging commercially-based technologies that meet our military’s needs.  And of course it's purpose, which is to connect innovative companies with that $72 million of annual funding. And we’ve also upgraded the operating system, with a new partnership-style leadership structure led by Raj Shah – a National Guardsman, F-16 pilot, combat veteran, and co-founder and CEO of a successful technology startup. Great guy. And we will keep iterating together and learning from each other going forward. That's the point. And that’s also a reason why I recently created a Defense Innovation Board, to advise me and future defense secretaries on how to continue building bridges to the technology community, and on how we can continue to change to be more competitive.  And I’m pleased that Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt is serving as the board’s chair . He’s doing a great job putting together the rest of the board. And today I can tell you this board will include, for example, Reid Hoffman, the head of LinkedIn; former SOCOM Commander Admiral Bill McRaven - great thinker about innovative and operational approaches; and the noted historian of innovation, Walter Isaacson.  And we’ve got some additional amazing innovators lined up,  so stay tuned for who else will be joining Eric and the board. They're going to begin their work over the summer, and I expect to receive their first recommendations in the fall. Among other things, I’ve charged them with keeping DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, organizations, operations, and technology …to support people who innovate; to support those creative figures in the Department who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate; and to ensure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of potential adversaries. And I stress innovation in people because as good as America’s technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people – they’re the key reason why our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent for our All-Volunteer Force. That’s why we’re building what I call the Force of the Future, to ensure that amid changes in generations, technologies, and labor markets, we’re always postured to bring in, develop, and retain the best young men and women that America has to offer. As part of that, we’re implementing several new initiatives to give some of our own people, military and civilian, the opportunity to get out and to learn how the rest of the world works outside of our walls. For example, we’re expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family. We’re also looking for ways to allow more of America’s brightest minds to come into DoD maybe just for a short time, maybe just for some - one project, but to contribute to the great mission of protecting America and making a better world. We're bringing in resident entreprenuers who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two. And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense. He's one of the people who got me into this business. We’ve also created the new Defense Digital Service, which you heard about from Chris Lynch earlier today. He’s helping us bring in coders from companies like Google, Palantir, and Shopify for what we call a “tour of duty.”  And they’ve solved some really important problems for us, like improved data sharing between DoD and the VA, to make sure our veterans get access to their benefits. We’re also nearing completion, as I stand here today, of our pilot program called Hack the Pentagon, where we invited vetted hackers to test our cybersecurity.  This is similar to the “bug bounties” that many leading tech companies have. It's a widespread best practice in the outside world, but we're conducting the first ever one done by the federal government. It’s again exceeded all of our expectations – over 1,400 hackers registered. They discovered more than 100 bugs so far. And their help - so they're helping us to be more secure at a fraction of the cost, and in a way that enlists the brilliance of the white hatters rather than waits to learn the lessons of the black hatters. Another example that’s having a real impact is our Cyber Mission Force.  These are talented people– some active-duty, but also Reservists and National Guardsmen – who have saved networks by hunting down intruders in our networks, performing the forensics that help keep our systems secure, and combating our adversaries in the cyber realm. So these are just some of the actions we’re taking to build the Force of the Future. We’ve also announced actions to help retain talent within the military – helping us retain experienced service members by helping them balance their commitments to the force and their families through expanded maternity and paternity leave, extended childcare hours on bases, and by offering military members with families the possibility of some geographic deployment flexibility in return for additional service commitments. And yesterday, I announced the next two links to the Force of the Future to expand our ability to attract, train and retain the best talent American has to offer. On the military side, we’ve proposed changes to the promotion system to allow military officers to pursue broadening opportunities, like earning their doctorate, or pursuing other advanced training, or doing a tour with industry, to temporarily defer when they’re considered for promotion, without being penalized by timeline restrictions - a very big move. We’ve also moved to allow civilians with very specific skill sets, such as cyber and other scientific and technical qualifications, to enter the officer ranks at a level commensurate with their experience. We currently permit this for doctors, but not for other jobs that are not only high-skill, but also hard-to-fill, rapidly changing, and in high demand by the private sector. We’re proposing changes that would foster innovation in our civilian workforce. For example, we’ve proposed allowing recruiters to hire top talent directly from college campuses. Again, for the first time for us. A kid graduates, he isn't going to wait around for an offer from the government, from DoD, that doesn't ripen for six months. That's not the way they're going to act and we're going to miss the good ones. We’re also expanding DoD's STEM scholarship-for-service program, building two-way talent exchanges with the private sector. And we’re going to better leverage our existing authorities to directly hire Highly Qualified Experts into jobs across the department.  Today we only have about 90 such experts onboard across the department. You've heard from two of them today – Chris Lynch and Will Roper. I’m sure you’ll agree that we’re better off for their service. And we’d be well served to include more incisive thinkers like them directly contributing to our mission of national defense. Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to it. We’ve always been able to out-innovate our enemies, because we have our people – the builders, the operators, the innovators from our military and civilian force as well as our contractors and our nation’s overall wonderful strength, which is its technology base – people who think creatively, who are flexible, and who’ve always been able to combine our advanced technology with creative practices to solve the problem at hand.  In order for our people to continue accelerating the breakthroughs and progress that ensure our continued dominance, we must back them up with the freedom to innovate and take risks, and with a stable and secure funding environment. This last is why I remain concerned about proposals in the draft defense bills in Congress that would undercut the bipartisan budget agreement reached just last year, and that was supposed to guide our budget for two years.  The unraveling of bipartisanship could end up in a return of sequester, which our great risk as a Department.   Also objectionable in time of war are provisions cutting the overseas warfighting accounts.  And there are also some new and unstudied managerial proposals – adding and moving boxes here and there – that the Department’s leadership has not recommended.  I hope that such micromanagement will not be a feature of any enacted NDAA. We all play a role in ensuring the success of the national security mission. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. This is also true for those interested in technology. But the intersection of the two is truly an opportunity-rich environment. So I want to thank you for being here today, and for considering the words of all of the forward thinking individuals from government, business and academia who’ve shared their thoughts today. My pledge to you is that you will always have strong and willing partner in America’s Department of Defense.  We may not do it perfectly, but we're always trying to do it better. Helping defend your country for you, helping to defend your country and making a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, a technologist, an entrepreneur, or young person can do with their life.  And we’re grateful to all of you for the passion, the interest and the spirit of innovation that makes us all stronger.  So thank you.

"March 8, 2016","Today is International Women’s Day, a moment to celebrate the contributions and achievements of women around the world from our past and present.  From Margaret Corbin’s heroism during the American Revolution, to the first Navy WAVES during World War II, to the first women soldiers who graduated from the elite Army Ranger School last year, women have been serving, fighting, and contributing to the security and prosperity of our great nation since its founding, and continue to do so today. The Department of Defense must continue to be open and inclusive as we strive to bring in America's best talent, including from our extraordinary community of women, who make up more than 50 percent of the American population. To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half the country’s talents and skills – we have to take full advantage of every individual who can meet our high standards. That’s why I recently announced that DoD is opening all military occupations and positions to women. Going forward, this will enable our military to better harness the skills and perspectives that talented women have to offer. We’ve also made other important strides to empower women around the globe. Through the implementation of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, DoD is supporting programs aimed at advancing women’s inclusion in peace building and conflict prevention processes, and addressing the impact of violence and conflict on women and girls.  Through courses and seminars hosted by DoD’s regional centers and geographic combatant commands, we encourage our friends and allies to expand the recruitment and retention of women in their security sectors and the incorporation of gender perspectives into their peace and security policy.  Also, in training partner militaries in peacekeeping operations, our forces help equip them to better prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence. Today and every day, let us pledge to continue our work to advance the status of women and girls worldwide, and to build the future strength of the finest fighting force the world has ever seen by harnessing the talents, skills, and perspectives of 100 percent of America’s population.

"May 27, 2015","Well, with so many military careers, Sam – like so with – like with so many military careers, excuse me, Sam Locklear’s began with enlistment papers. Some of you may not know this, but because Sam was committed to serving his country when he was still 17 years old, he needed his parents to sign that permission. And more than four decades later, we’re very grateful that they did, because in those years of service, Sam has helped make the United States and the world safer, and at Pacific Command, he inspired and then led a rebalance to a region vital to our future. So ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, elected leaders: good morning, and aloha! Today, we celebrate the careers of some of our Navy’s finest admirals – Sam Locklear, his successor Harry Harris, and our new PACFLEET Commander Scott Swift. All well known to me. We came together at Pearl Harbor, 70 years after the end of World War II, to mark this, the change of command at PACOM, our oldest and largest combatant command. PACOM’s leaders – and all who serve under them – are charged with protecting the nation while assuring the peace that’s been the hallmark of the Pacific region for many, many years. Sam has done so, and I’m sure Harry will do the same. As we honor Sam today, I’d like to thank his parents – his father Sam and his mother Margaret – who helped launch this remarkable career. They couldn’t be here today, but I know Sam is incredibly proud of his dad, whom he describes as a “Renaissance Man,” and his loving mom, whom he claims is the best cook the South has ever seen. I’d also like to thank Sam’s two daughters Jil and Jenny for the love, support, and encouragement they’ve provided him throughout his career. And I want to make sure we all recognize – we all recognize Sam’s wonderful wife Pam. Pam, thank you for your service and sacrifices as well. Managing 29 moves over the years isn’t easy. But we thank you for every one of them, and everything else you’ve done to support Sam. I know you’re looking forward to spending more time with him, and staying put for a while. Now, I’ve said this many times, but it bears repeating – America’s future rests with the Asia-Pacific. And Sam leveraged all of America’s unrivaled strengths, and the tremendous U.S. forces PACOM brings to bear in this region – over 350,000 military and civilian personnel, nearly 2,000 aircraft, and 180 naval vessels – to meet the commitments President Obama made when he announced the rebalance. Sam has also been a diplomat. He’s charmed everyone, as he likes to say, from Hollywood to Bollywood with his good sense and his – again, as he calls it – “South Carolina English.” He’s been the de facto ambassador to Asia for me and for two of my predecessors, nurturing long-time alliances and partnerships, while developing – helping our nation develop new friendships. As a strategist, Sam helped transform U.S. military posture and planning. He enhanced American presence in the Asia-Pacific. He organized hundreds of exercises that increased readiness, cooperation, and contingency planning. He helped improve our counterterrorism efforts and our ability to respond to attacks at home. And he spearheaded our work on cybersecurity, ensuring that our forces are prepared for tomorrow. Finally, as a leader, Sam recognized the importance of people – both the region’s and his own – our own. He organized humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, including Operation Damayan after Typhoon Haiyan struck Southeast Asia a short time ago. And he took great care of his most precious asset – his people, our people – the men and women of PACOM who work to protect us every day. Sam has left a tremendous legacy – in making the rebalance a reality, and as a diplomat, strategist, and leader. But along the way, he also taught so many of us, including me, about America’s enduring interests and commitments in the Asia-Pacific. Sam’s advised a generation of government and military leaders – Secretaries of Defense, National Security Advisors, Joint Chiefs – and we’re going to remember those lessons and build on his legacy as we enter the next phase of our rebalance. As we do so, we want to improve on what he describes as the, quote, “patchwork quilt” that makes up this region’s security architecture. That’s why, when I speak at the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, I’ll call for the region to strengthen its security institutions and relationships to ensure we can maintain lasting peace and stability in a region that is undergoing significant change. But as Sam knows so well, this region’s security is rooted in something deeper and more fundamental, which is a commitment to shared values and principles – like a commitment to the rule of law, to resolving disputes through diplomacy rather than coercion, and to maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight. The United States, the Department of Defense, and PACOM have always stood up for those principles, and we always will, because they’ve assured the Asia-Pacific’s peace and prosperity, for decades, was widely shared and widely supported. That’s why I want to be clear about our position on the South China Sea. First, we want a peaceful resolution of all disputes, and an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by any claimant. We also oppose any further militarization of disputed features. Second – and there should be no mistake, should be no mistake about this – the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all around the world. Finally, with its actions in the South China Sea, China is out of step with both international norms that underscore the Asia-Pacific’s security architecture, and the regional consensus in favor of a non-coercive approach to this and other long-standing disputes. China’s actions are bringing countries in the region together in new ways.  And they’re increasing demand for American engagement in the Asia-Pacific, and we’re going to meet it. We will remain the principal security power in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come. Thank you, Sam, for all you’ve done to help us live up to that commitment. In doing so, you’ve helped the ‘big-P’ Pacific stay ‘small-p’ pacific. You’ve been a source of tremendous insight and advice for me. And you’ve laid the groundwork to ensure stability for decades to come. On behalf of our nation and all the men and women of DoD, Sam, I thank you. Pam, I thank you. Now, we’re fortunate we didn’t have to look too far for Sam’s replacement – we found someone just down the road. Admiral Harry Harris is the son of a Navy Chief Petty Officer who served on the U.S.S. Lexington, which left Pearl Harbor just a few days before that fateful Sunday morning in December 1941. And throughout Harry’s career, he’s dedicated to make himself – to making certain that we’re never surprised again. At PACFLEET, he helped bring our most advanced capabilities to the Asia-Pacific and shift 60 percent of our naval assets to the region. He also stressed and maintained the readiness that’s at a premium in this dynamic region. For all those reasons and many more, Harry’s the PACOM commander we need for the next phase of the rebalance. Harry, thank you for accepting this new mission, and Bruni, we thank you for your unwavering support. We’re all very grateful to both of you for your continued commitment and service to our country. I’d also like to recognize Admiral Swift. Now Scott, I know your call-sign is “Notso.” We all know that. But you’re plenty swift. Known you for a long time, and I look forward to your leadership on maritime security in the years to come. And Trish, we thank you for your continued commitment as well. Finally, we soberly remember, here at Pearl Harbor, how quickly and how unexpectedly peace can disappear. An old friend of mine likes to say that security is like oxygen. When you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it. But when you don’t have enough, you can think of nothing else. In a region that has enjoyed decades of stability and prosperity, it’s only human nature for some to take security for granted. But we cannot, and will not, make that mistake. Sam Locklear never did. And I am certain that neither Harry Harris nor Scott Swift will do so either, as they help us move into the next phase of our rebalance to the region, help lead the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and help protect the peace and prosperity of the Pacific for years to come. Thank you. And now, I’d like to invite Sam and Pam onstage here for a moment.

"April 8, 2016","Good afternoon everyone, and, Richard, thanks. Thanks so much for those words, for decades of friendship, your leadership here at the Council, and above all for your public service, which continues, as Richard is a member of the Department’s Defense Policy Board, we count on him for advice on all subjects all the time.  He and I were just talking shortly before this about some things that he is preparing to give us some advice on in just a few weeks’ time. It’s nice to see a lot of old friends here at the Council. I looked at the list of attendees coming and it was like a homecoming in many, many ways.  Great to visit all my friends, and to be here at the Council.  Because for generations now, the Council has hosted the debates and supported the thinkers and ideas that have shaped America’s relationship with the world.  And those ideas are important as ever, as we enter a new strategic era.  Indeed, today's security environment is dramatically different from the one we've had for the last 25 years. In this era, we face no fewer five evolving major, immediate challenges:  countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, including China’s rise, which we welcome, and some of its actions, such as in the South China Sea, about which we share the serious concerns of all in the region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear pursuits and provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf and protecting our friends and allies, especially Israel; and accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it’s metastasizing around the world, as well as protecting our people here in the homeland. The United States, and the Department of Defense, must and will address all five of those challenges.  To do so is going to require new strategic and operational approaches, new force posture in many places, and large investments in new and enhanced capabilities.  And all this we’re doing. But today, I want to talk to you about how we are meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities in the Asia-Pacific, and in particular our growing security network there.  Almost all the nations there are asking us to do more with them…bilaterally and multilaterally.  Tomorrow, as Richard said, I leave for India and the Philippines, and I’m going to highlight today some of the advances we’ll be announcing along the way. The Asia-Pacific is, Richard made this point, the single most consequential region for America's future.  We have long played an essential and pivotal role in that region.  And we’re working today, both individually and with our allies and partners, to ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone – everyone – can rise and prosper. That has been America’s objective and practice for decades.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has played a pivotal role…economically, politically, and militarily in the Asia-Pacific. Along with a wide variety of partners and allies, for decades we have stood tall for enduring principles, including peaceful resolution of disputes, and the freedom of navigation and overflight.  We helped ensure that countries can make their own security and economic choices, free from coercion and intimidation.  And we’ve promoted free trade and the rule of law to support development and unprecedented growth. Of course, fundamentally, sustaining this human progress requires as a foundation security and stability.  And the United States has helped provide both with its strong defense engagement in the region.  The highly capable men and women of the American armed forces, and our unique technology and assets, coupled to our values, have long provided the necessary reassurance – an attractive, and appealing reassurance – and worked to keep the peace, in the Asia-Pacific.  And because we have done so inclusively, in a principled and respectful way, we have developed alliances and partnerships all over the region.  These relationships – nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice – form the bedrock of our role in the Asia-Pacific, and, accordingly, its stability and prosperity. The results have been extraordinary – in the interests of, and to the benefit of, all nations, including the United States.  Since World War II, millions have been lifted from poverty and into the middle class.  And even though there’s still room for improvement, democracy and freedom have spread to places across the region.  And economic miracle after miracle has occurred in the region: first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, rose and prospered, and now, today, China and India are doing the same. This progress creates opportunities for the region to continue to grow.  But of course, dramatic change also can produce some negatives.  And, recently, not all the news out of the Asia-Pacific has been positive: indeed, in the South China Sea, China’s actions – in particular – are raising regional tensions. That’s why countries across the Asia-Pacific are voicing concern with militarization, and especially – over the last year – with China’s actions, which stand out in size and scope…they’re voicing those concerns publicly and privately, at the highest levels, in regional meetings, and global fora.  That’s why many of those countries are reaching out anew to the United States to uphold the rules and principles that have allowed the region to thrive.  That’s why we support intensified regional diplomacy, not increased tensions, the threat of force, or unilateral changes to the status quo.  And that’s one reason why we are making enormous investments in our capabilities; why so many are asking us to do more with them; and why we’ll continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  Because we must continue the progress that has helped so many in the region rise and prosper. President Obama launched the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific to ensure that we do our part to make that bright opportunity come to pass. While I am of course absorbed myself with the defense component of the rebalance, I should be clear that one of the most important strategic parts of the rebalance is the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.  TPP will bind the United States more closely together with 11 other economies, and unlock economic opportunities for the United States and many of its allies and partners.  And TPP will help reinforce the open and inclusive economic approach that has benefited so many in the Asia-Pacific. TTP should be ratified because of its economic and strategic benefits, and because we must recognize what the alternative to TPP really is: a regional economy with standards that don’t serve American interests, and one that’s carved up by lop-sided, coercively negotiated, lower-standard deals.  That’s why I’ve said that TPP is as strategically important to the rebalance as an aircraft carrier, and I strongly urge Congress to approve TPP this year. Militarily, the Department of Defense is operationalizing the next phase of the rebalance, and cementing it for the long term. We are enhancing America's force posture throughout this vitally important region to continue playing a pivotal role from the sea, in the air, and under the water, as well as to make our posture more geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.  To do so we continue to bring the best people and platforms forward to the Asia-Pacific – not only increasing the number of U.S. military personnel in the region, part of some 365,000 assigned the Asia-Pacific today, but also sending and stationing some of our most advanced capabilities there.  That includes F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, continuous deployments of B-2 and B-52 strategic bombers, and also our newest surface warfare ships, like the amphibious assault ship U.S.S America, and all three of our newest class of stealth destroyers, the DDG-1000, which will all be homeported with the Pacific fleet.  And all the while, we’re bringing America’s regional force posture into the 21st century, by rotating American personnel into new and more places, like northern Australia and new sites in the Philippines, and modernizing our existing footprint in Japan and the Republic of Korea.  How we’re doing this is a reflection of a shift we’re making across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marine Corps – after fifteen years of intensive effort in counter insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan – toward full-spectrum operations. In our 2017 defense budget, which I’ve presented to Congress over the past few weeks, we are making investments critical to the rebalance.  One is our surface fleet, which under our budget grows both the number of ships and, importantly, above all, their capabilities – to deter, and if deterrence fails, defeat even the most advanced potential naval adversaries, and protect the maritime security we all depend on.  Just one new example of how we’re making our ships’ capabilities increasingly lethal is by maximizing production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, which now has a brand new anti-ship capability – and I could go on.  We’re also investing to ensure our continued air superiority and global reach, including with over $12 billion for the new B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber.  Another investment is in undersea capabilities, where we continue to dominate and where we’re investing over $8 billion just next year to ensure ours is the most lethal and most advanced undersea and anti-submarine force in the world.  That includes new undersea drones – in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – that can, importantly operate in shallow waters where manned submarines can’t.  We’re also making large new investments in cyber, electronic warfare, and space capabilities, a total of $34 billion just next year.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  And more is coming, including some surprises. We’re also strengthening our alliances and partnerships, which will be the focus of my trip this coming week.  And in that regard, let me take you on a brief tour of what we are doing with partners around the region, and then focus on India and the Philippines where I’ll be traveling next week and important advances are being made that occasion my trip. Our alliances and partnerships are and will remain one of our most important strategic assets.  Our allies around the world, including those in the Asia-Pacific, have stood with us – and fought with us – time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL.  And we are just as committed to them.  As history has shown, we have fought with our friends and allies – and to defend the principles and values we share – in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. While I can’t take the time to detail it today, both Japan and Republic of Korea are strengthening their own militaries, and changing how they operate within our alliances in fundamental and forward-looking ways.  We’re sharing our best and newest capabilities, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which we’ll soon begin to operate with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  Meanwhile, we’re developing newer partnerships, with Vietnam, with Malaysia, with Indonesia and others, while also enhancing our high-performing partnership with Singapore.  And we’re holding more numerous and more sophisticated exercises with a growing network of partner countries, none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC, which will bring together more than two dozen navies – nearly twice the number that participated just six years ago – to develop the relationships that are critical to ensuring the safety and security and peace of the region’s sea lanes. You can see the breadth and depth of our bilateral efforts with one of our key growing partners: India, where I’ll arrive a short time from now.  The U.S.-India relationship is destined to be one of the most significant partnerships of the 21st century.  Ours are two great nations that share a great deal: democratic governments, multiethnic and multicultural societies with a commitment to individual freedom and inclusivity and growing, innovative, open economies. Over the course of my years at the Defense Department, I have seen a remarkable convergence of U.S. and Indian interests – what I call a strategic handshake.  As the United States is reaching west in its rebalance, India is reaching east, in Prime Minister Modi’s “Act East” policy that will bring it farther into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We see this handshake reflected in the Joint Strategic Vision Statement that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi released last January, and the 2015 Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship, also a new thing, which Indian Defense Minister Parrikar and I signed last year in Delhi.  The Defense Framework is foundational and it’s going to guide the U.S.-India defense relationship for the next decade. There’s another handshake between our countries as well – a technological one.  In 2012, the United States and India created the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative  to leverage the convergence between our industrial and technological abilities in an unprecedented way – This, after half a century since Indian independence, of separation of our militaries and our industrial systems – that Initiative grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s “Make in India” campaign to expand the nation’s industrial and defense base, and it will lead to greater co-production and co-development of defense capabilities.  While in India, I will meet with Prime Minister Modi and also Defense Minister Parrikar to discuss the progress we’ve made together in aircraft carrier, jet fighter, and jet engine collaboration.  And we’ll talk about exciting new projects, the details of which I can’t go into this afternoon.  But stay tuned for when I meet with Minister Parrikar. There is so much potential here, which is why we’re seizing every opportunity we can.  Last year, the Modi government reached out to the United States to discuss the possibility of launching joint production on a new platform, to build on the work Lockheed Martin and Indian industry achieved on the C-130J project, and what Boeing and Indian industry will achieve in the production of the Apache and Chinook helicopters India – recently purchased. Members of my team, and industry, are right now – as we are here in New York – in India looking at the potential production of fighter aircraft.  These conversations represent the growing enthusiasm of the U.S.-India partnership, and even more than that, its promise.  While these negotiations can be difficult and global competition is high, I have no doubt that in the coming years, the United States and India will embark on a landmark co-production agreement that will bring our two countries closer together and make our militaries stronger. As our strategic and technological interests have drawn together, so too have our military ties.  We are coming together operationally across domains – by air, land, and sea – to collaborate in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security, and maritime domain awareness.  This week, we will also conclude several important agreements, including one on commercial shipping information exchange, which will make many new things possible in the future. Our gathering partnership in defense can also be seen in India’s return to major joint exercises like RED FLAG, our prestigious, U.S. Air Force-hosted aerial combat training exercise where all our top pilots – and those from countries like India – train together.  India will again participate in the RIMPAC – as I mentioned, the world’s largest international maritime exercise.  And, in the MALABAR exercise, Japan, India, and the United States – all three – have operated together at sea in such critical training as air defense and anti-submarine warfare. From India, I’ll travel to the Philippines, with which we have one of our longest relationships in the region.  We share much history and many common ties with the Philippines.  And our long-running defense alliance has been a cornerstone of peace and stability in the region for more than 65 years.  And as President Obama’s made clear: our commitment to the Philippines is ironclad. Today, our alliance is as close as it has been in many years, thanks to two major recent steps forward that occasion my visit in coming days: first is the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, a landmark agreement ratified in the Philippines in January, and also the new U.S. Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative by which we – that is, the Department of Defense – are helping to fund these changes in the Philippines and other partners. As part of EDCA’s implementation, we’re supporting modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces and strengthening mutual defense, an arrangement that will allow our forces, at the invitation of the Government of the Philippines, to conduct regular rotational training, exercises, and activities. We recently announced an initial slate of five EDCA Agreed Locations for the alliance activities, locations arrayed throughout the archipelago that will offer the opportunity for increasingly complex bilateral engagements.  I plan to visit two of those locations next week: first, Fort Magsaysay and Antonio Bautista Air Force Base. At Fort Magsaysay, the former [sic – future] home of the Philippine Army’s premier training facility, we previously made use of limited pre-positioned disaster relief supplies that supported our response to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.  EDCA will enable us to augment these stocks and add new ones to the air base, thereby improving our ability to respond to future disasters.  I’ll be discussing more at both of these sites when I arrive in the Philippines. And, last year at the region’s Shangri-La Dialogue, I announced our Maritime Security Initiative.  This initiative represents a $425-million-dollar, five-year commitment by the Defense Department to help countries like the Philippines share information, identify potential threats, and work collaboratively to address common challenges in the region. We’ve just released the first tranche of this money, nearly 80 percent of which is going to the Philippines.  There it will help modernize the technology and train staff at the Philippines National Coast Watch Center, enhance an information network to enable the sharing of classified communications between U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii and key Philippines maritime command centers, provide an aerostat reconnaissance platform, and outfit Philippine navy patrol vessels with better sensors so they can see and do more in the region’s waters. These two things, EDCA and the Maritime Security Initiative will take the U.S.-Philippines alliance capability to a new level, one has not seen in decades.  I will also see some of this firsthand at Exercise BALIKATAN 2016, our premier exercise with the Philippines.  Balikatan is going on right now, and it includes over 7,000 personnel from every military service in both countries, dozens of American aircraft, vehicles, and vessels, including one of our air craft carriers, and several important components, including a simulated gas and oil platform recovery raid in the South China Sea. Balikatan signals shared resolve.  It enhances our shared capabilities.  And it demonstrates, once again, America’s dedication to standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Philippines. Like our alliance with the Philippines and our developing partnership with India, America’s bilateral relationships remain the bedrock of our presence and engagement in the Asia-Pacific.  But in a large and interconnected region, especially one with so many strong, capable, and dedicated players, it makes sense to network and link relationships to produce gains for all. That’s what we are doing.  Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific has never been maintained by a region-wide alliance like NATO – no comparable, formal structure .  That’s made sense for the Asia-Pacific, with its unique history, geography, and politics.  Instead, regional security, stability, and prosperity have required nations working together less formally, and the United States has been an important builder, cement, and participant in this arrangement. Today, as the region changes, the United States is augmenting our bilateral relationships and alliances with trilateral and multilateral arrangements.  And we’re weaving these partnerships together to more effectively bolster American and regional security.  This network – with its shared values, habits of cooperation, and compatible and complementary capabilities –will expand the reach of all, responsibly share the security burden, and help ensure the peace and stability in the region for years to come. This burgeoning network builds in three ways. First, the Defense Department is strongly emphasizing trilateral mechanisms to bring together like-minded allies and partners to maximize individual contributions to regional peace and security and link together nations that previously worked with us mostly separately.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Korea trilateral partnership helps us all work together as well as share information and coordinate responses to, for example, North Korean provocations.  Last month’s trilateral meeting between President Obama, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and President Park on this topic was historic. The U.S.-Japan-Australia relationship is also expanding practical cooperation; enhancing exercises, training, and information sharing; and building capabilities.  And our burgeoning U.S.-Japan-India trilateral relationship is evolving from a strategic dialogue – where it began – through joint activities like the MALABAR Exercise, to real, practical security cooperation that spans the entire region from the subcontinent right around to East Asia. Second, to improve regional security, we’re encouraging our allies and partners to actively develop their own interconnected security relationships.  Many countries within the Asia-Pacific are strengthening their bilateral relationships with one another in ways that we think enhance regional stability, but they’re also creating their own trilateral arrangements.  The Japan-Australia-India trilateral meeting last June was a welcome development. Third, we are helping create an interconnected regional architecture – from one end of the region to another – through engagement and activities in multilateral fora, such as the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting.  In this way, the United States is helping strengthen relationships and building partner capabilities on key issues like maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.  Singapore has shown great leadership in this area by hosting an operations center to coordinate activities across ASEAN. It’s important to remember, that our bilateral, trilateral, and multinational relationships, and the developing network they comprise, is not aimed at any particular country.  Rather, it demonstrates that the region wants cooperation, not coercion, and a continuation, not an end, of decades of stability, peace, and progress. The network’s not closed and excludes no one: we want cooperation and shared leadership so that as other nations want to contribute to regional stability and security, they can work with the other nations of the region to do so.  For example, we have disagreements with China, but we are committed to working through them in ways that do not destabilize the region.  That is one reason why we will continue to pursue a military-to-military relationship with China focused on risk reduction and practical cooperation in areas of mutual interest. This network, over all, demonstrates the United States’ commitment to remaining a pivotal and essential leader in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.  By operationalizing the rebalance, by transforming old alliances and new partnerships, and by networking security, we can gather force and respond to any manner of crisis, man-made or natural disaster, and continue to promote and defend the principles that have allowed so many in the region to rise and proper for so long. Let me close with a few words, about who makes that possible. As I stand here, there are hundreds of thousands of men and women serving and defending our country, right now, in every time zone, in every domain…in the air, ashore, and afloat.  They’re the ones who are operationalizing the rebalance.  They’re making the network work. They need always to be in our minds. You know, they say that security – frequently, this is said in that region – is like oxygen…when you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  But when you don’t have enough, you can think of nothing else.  America’s servicemembers provide the oxygen…the security that allows millions upon millions of people, not just in America, and not just in the Asia-Pacific, but in so much of the world to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines take grave risks to provide that security, and some make the ultimate sacrifice.  They do so not just because they were ordered to.  They do so not only because they want to protect their buddies.  They do so because they know they help make the world a better place through American leadership. In a new strategic era, and at a time of great change, we must and will continue that play that essential, principled role in the Asia-Pacific.  We will work with new partners, and old allies.  We will network our security relationships.  We will invest and innovate…we will change how we plan, how we operate, and even how we fight. But we’ll never change what we are willing to fight for: for our safety and freedoms, for that of our friends and allies, and for the values, principles, and rules-based order that produced security, stability, and prosperity for all.  Because we do so, we will continue to ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper for generations to come. Thank you. ","Remarks on ""America's Growing Security Network in the Asia-Pacific"" (Council on Foreign Relations)",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/716909/remarks-on-americas-growing-security-network-in-the-asia-pacific-council-on-for/
"May 17, 2016"," Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks, John. I appreciate that. And thanks for all you do. On shore and afloat, in the air and under the sea, in every time zone around the world, our men and women in uniform are confronting these challenges in order to protect the American people and our interests worldwide. And in order to ensure that they have the capabilities that they need, we're making decisions based on the challenges we face and the right strategies that will help us to meet them. And we're pursuing new technology development, along with new operational concepts and new organizational constructs, all of which are reflected in or supported by our 2017 budget submission to maintain our military's technological superiority and assure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.

Our budget refocuses the Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts. We're looking at our overall warfighting posture, which is signified by presence, because it's overall posture that determines whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary win a full- spectrum conflict. Our budget this year increases the number of ships to meet the department's 308-ship posture requirement by 2021. And even more importantly, it will make our naval forces more capable, more survivable, and more lethal, too. Lethality is the key word here, as Admiral Richardson has stressed. We're investing in ways to make our weapons more lethal, as well as making our ships harder to find and harder to attack. That's why our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms alone, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years.

First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – an area where we should be and will be doing more, not less, going forward. It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, included in improved heavy weight torpedo, as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo.  It includes $29.4 billion to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years – four of those submarines, up from three in last year's budget, will be equipped with a versatile Virginia Payload Module, which can more than triple each submarine's strike capacity.

Next week, I'll see a Virginia-class-ship building up close in Groton. The budget also includes new funding for unmanned, undersea systems in multiple sizes and diverse payloads that can, importantly, operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.

Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary, prevail in a full spectrum conflict, even against most advanced adversaries. It maximizes production of the SM-6, one of our most modern and capable missiles, an investment doubly important, given the SM-6's new anti-ship capability. And it invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads, including the SM-3 high altitude ballistic missile interceptor, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, and the most advanced Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which is being upgraded for maritime strike.

The budget also invests a total of $18.3 billion to buy two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 – as well as nearly $3 billion for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing a total of more than $13 billion for new construction of Ford-class carriers, and it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers.

And third, to ensure the U.S. military's and our sea services' continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in aviation platforms and payloads. We're investing a total of $8 billion in a wide range of versatile munitions, including buying more of the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, as I said, the extended range of Anti-Radiation Guided Missile too, and the AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.

In particular, our Naval Aviation component is focused on the concept of integrated warfare to project power over and from the sea, and at the heart of this concept with the F-35, the P-8, and other air assets that are critical nodes which capture and disseminate information in an unprecedented manner, ultimately improving lethality across the battle space. That's one reason why we're maturing our investments in the stealthy five generation F-35 JSF, and to make sure our fleet has a sufficient quantity of advanced tactical aircraft long into the future, our budget also increases the Navy and the Marine Corps F-35 procurements. We're completing procurement in the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft as well. We're also buying an additional 16 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and F.Y. 2018, providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps fourth generation fighter aircraft fleet so it's ready and capable for today's missions. And lastly, to address the Navy and Marine Corps maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F/A-18 depot maintenance capacity for the Navy and the Marine Corps. With this budget, our fleet will be larger and our sea services will be much more effective, potent and lethal than they are today because they'll be equipped with the weapons and the advanced capabilities that they will need to deter any aggressor, and make any aggressor, who isn't deterred, very much regret their decision to take on the United States. Now, in order to maintain that lethality and capability ahead of all others in what is, after all, a competitive world, we need to continue to invest in innovation, to think outside of our five-sided box. That's why one of my top priorities as Secretary of Defense is to build, and in some cases to rebuild, the bridges between the Pentagon and the innovative business community that for decades has buttressed one of America's greatest strengths, namely superior technology. And as I'm building bridges from the DOD side, I know there are those in the private sector, including members of the Navy League represented here today, who are building from the other, and we appreciate that. Our men and women in uniform operate in an increasingly competitive and changing world – particularly when it comes to technology. And when I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly by the Department of Defense. Now, today, we're still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial and the technology base is global. Indeed, technologies once possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now come into the hands of previously less-capable militaries and even non-state actors. Meanwhile, nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap. So to stay ahead of those challenges, to stay the best, and to keep our edge, we're investing aggressively in high-end innovation and to enhance our own asymmetric and hybrid capabilities. For example, we're investing a combined total of $34 billion across the cyber, electronic warfare and space domains in F.Y. '17 alone. We're building fast, resilient microdrones that can be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach .9 and fly through heavy winds. We're developing an arsenal plane, which will function as a very large airborne magazine with different conventional payloads, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensors and targeting nodes. And for the Navy, we're working on autonomous, self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in  surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial – without putting our sailors at risk. These are just a few of many examples. Overall, our budget invests nearly $72 billion in R&D. To give you a little context, that's more than double what Apple, Intel and Google spent on R&D last year combined. That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services in our dozens of DOD labs and engineering centers across the country, and at DARPA to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing in computing.

And at the same time, we're also investing in further partnerships with our nation's innovative private-sector in technology communities – in places like Boston, Silicon Valley, Austin, Seattle, Northern Virginia and America's many, many other hubs of globally unrivaled innovation.

Last week, I visited and announced enhancements to a path-breaking innovation hub that we launched in Silicon Valley. I call it the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx – which is essentially an outpost of us, of the Pentagon on the West Coast – to help broaden the range of great companies that we work with. We've launched and funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes across the country to advance emerging technologies like flexible hybrid electronics, which will make it possible to seamlessly print lightweight, flexible, structural integrity sensors right onto the surface of ships and aircraft; revolutionary textiles which combine fibers and yarns with things like circuits and LEDs, solar cells, electronic sensors and other capabilities to create fabrics that can see and hear and sense and communicate, store energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, change color and much more.

But as good as America's technology is, it's nothing compared to our people – they're the reason why our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. It's them. And in the future, our mission requires that we continue to recruit and retain the very best talent. That's why we opened up all combat positions to women who qualify, in order to expand our access to 100 percent of Americans for our all-volunteer force.

It's also why we're building what I call the Force of the Future, to ensure that amid changes in generations, technologies and labor markets, we're always postured to bring in, develop and retain young men and women as fine as the ones it's our privilege to have in our military today.

Last November, I announced the first link to the Force of the Future, with over a dozen new initiatives, including programs such as the Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America's vibrant, innovative business community for a time—a few months, a year, a project—to help solve some of our most complex problems, and also expanding opportunities for those currently in DOD both military and civilian to gain new skills, experiences and perspectives by working outside of DOD. And reforms to improve and modernize our talent management systems, to make sure that we recruit, train and retain the best people for our best -- for our force in the best possible way. In January, I announced the second link, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families because this is, after all, a married force in the Navy. To improve their quality of life and for our purposes, get them to stay, stick with us, including expanded maternity and paternity leave, as well as extended childcare on our bases and giving families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional commitments.

Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need any my commitment to it. And our work on this front continues full steam ahead – and while these first two links are important – we'll have more to announce on the Force of the Future in coming weeks.

In order to meet the challenges of the future, we're also innovating operationally, making sure that our contingency plans and operations are more flexible and dynamic in every region. Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win, both the fights we're in and the wars that could happen tomorrow—the ones we're in, the ones that could happen today and the ones that could happen tomorrow, I should say all three—we're always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, always innovating to stay ahead of that—including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, hybrid threats and anti-access area denial systems. And because we owe it to America's taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we're also pushing for needed reforms across the Defense enterprise. As a learning organization, DOD has a long history of striving to reform our command structures and improve how our strategies and policies are formulated, integrated and implemented. That's why last month I proposed several reforms to the Goldwater-Nichols Act – for example, to improve the Chairman of Joint Chief's ability to integrate, on my and the President's behalf, our military capabilities across domains and across cross-regional and cross-functional challenges, to simplify command and control and address where headquarters have become less efficient than they should be and to streamline our acquisition system. And I appreciate that the House and the Senate have advanced several of our recommendations in the annual National Defense Authorization Act.

In other areas, though, I have concerns about some of the reform proposals being put forward. One area I must comment on is the proposal—the Senate version of the NDAA—to extensively reorganize the functions of the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. I believe strongly in acquisition reform. It's a competitive world and we need to make the best use of taxpayer dollars. I appreciate the serious attention that both SASC and HASC have given this imperative in their bills. I share the views of the SASC that over time, the acquisition executive’s position has become so preoccupied with program management, including a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy associated with it, that perhaps takes some management attention away from the research and engineering function. In fact, I know this myself because I once served as the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, and I know the research and engineering function, both as an engineer and scientist and also because my first job was for then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, who had been a Director of Defense, Research and Engineering. And his Under Secretary, who was called the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, not AT&L, in those days, was Bill Perry, who also became Secretary of Defense. And I worked for and with every other incumbent of that job as it was renamed over time, including on the Defense Science Board for Robert McNamara’s Director of Defense, Research and Engineering, who was the Chairman of the DSB, Johnny Foster.

So, I do, however, have a serious caution: separating research and engineering from manufacturing, which is implied in this proposal, could introduce problems in the transition from the research and engineering phase to the production phase and then to the sustainment phase, and that is in fact, a frequent stumbling block for programs.

One need only remember the Joint Strike Fighter's growing pains, which I remember quite well, in moving from Engineering and Manufacturing Design, to Low-Rate Initial Reduction.

Procurement and sustainment are tightly coupled with technology and engineering and development, and those two together represent about 90 percent of program cost. So, separating these functions makes no sense, as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development. This proposal could also derail the success we've had lowering our contract cost grow in the most high-risk contracts to what is now a 35-year low. Finally, an overly prescriptive approach risks unhelpful micro-management with a high potential for negative second and third order effects. So, I would like to work with the committees on this and other provisions of their bill.

I'm also compelled to address the budget gimmickry included in the proposed NDAA in the House. Most disturbingly, it raids war funds in a time of war, when we have men and women deployed in operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. It also threatens the budget stability that undergirds all of the reforms, investments and initiatives I've detailed here today. And it threatens the readiness of the force – an actual contrast to the narrative its proponents propound. Now, I was an early advocate for Washington to escape gridlock, and to come together behind an agreement along the lines of last fall's Bipartisan Budget Act, for we in the Department are very grateful. The passage of this act gave us some much needed stability to plan and build for the future, after years of gridlock and turbulence. That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty, we focused on its shape and building the FY 2017 budget we've submitted and I've described—changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic year end to seize opportunities for the future. But the budget stability that was supposed to last for two years is already under threat after only six months with a proposal to underfund DOD's overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion and spend that money on programmatic items we didn't request. This approach is deeply troubling. It's flawed for several reasons. First and foremost for me, it's gambling with warfighting money at a time of war, proposing to cut off funding for ongoing operations in the middle of the fiscal year. Moreover, it would spend money taken from the war account on things, as I said, that are not DOD's highest priorities across the joint force. It's a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability the DOD needs and leaves us facing now the Department's greatest strategic threat, which is a return to sequestration, a $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts beginning next year if this isn't fixed.

And it's another road to nowhere with uncertain chances of ever becoming a law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution -- exactly the kind of terrible distraction we've had for years. It undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.

Particularly concerning is the potential impact of this proposal on the readiness of our force. Whether taken from overseas contingency operations or added on top of existing resources, buying force structure in this fiscal year without the resources to sustain it in future years is not the path to increased readiness. It's a path to a hollow force. It exacerbates the readiness challenges we currently have. Our readiness recovery plans are centered on synchronized and sustainable manning, training and equipping pipelines that are rigorously shaped based on the size of the force. For that reason, increasing the size of the force without sustaining our ranges and schoolhouses over time doesn't produce readiness. Buying additional force structure without expanding depots and shipyards in the years to come doesn't produce readiness.

Simply put, readiness is the most critical priority right now for each one of our services. And that's why our budget aggressively funded the readiness plans of each of the services, based on the most that is actually executable such as, for example, take an Army example, the maximum number of rotations through the National Training Centers. Readiness is the core of our mission, from the forces on the Korean Peninsula standing ready to “fight tonight,” to the ships patrolling the Persian Gulf, to the pilots flying over the Baltics. And the readiness of our men and women in uniform to carry out their missions and return home safely will always be my highest priority. Looking ahead, that's why I ordered a strategic portfolio review to determine if we are doing everything possible to help the services continue to recover their high-end combat readiness next year. We'll make adjustments to our plans in funding in FY 2018 based on the outcome of that review.

The raids on wartime funding in the House authorization bill and the concerning approach to reforming our research, engineering and acquisition enterprise in the Senate bill represent two specific concerns. The fact is, these bills have become lengthy and extraordinarily prescriptive. And the pages and provisions continue to accumulate from year to year. It's cumulative. They've been used repeatedly to block necessary reform in the Department, such as BRAC, and a wide range of force management approaches which are needed to sustain our enterprise and operate effectively.

I would respectfully suggest that the informed expert judgment of the civilian and military leadership at the Department of Defense, which is embodied in our budget proposal, should receive greater support and be subject to less micromanagement.

If a final version of the NDAA reaches the President this year and includes a raid on war funding that risks stability and gambles with war funding, jeopardizes readiness and rejects key judgments in the department, I'll be compelled to recommend that he veto the bill. I'm hopeful, however, that we can work with Congress to achieve a better solution. Our warfighters deserve nothing less because our mission is a deadly serious one. It's been said that security is like oxygen; when you have enough of it, you tend to pay no attention to it, but when you don't have enough, you can think of nothing else. The men and women of our military are not only defending the United States and its people, they're providing the oxygen that provides better lives and a better world.

It's in the new commitment. I saw the same dedication to these principles last month when I was at the American Cemetery in Manila, where 17,000 Americans, many sailors and Marines, are buried after making the ultimate sacrifice in the Pacific. And I see it in our newest personnel and I'm sure I'll see the same commitment in the eyes of our Navy and Marine officers next week at the Naval Academy commencement in Annapolis. Because in a new strategic era and a time of great change, we must and will continue to ensure the security, stability and prosperity that has meant so much to so many here at home and around the world. To do so, we'll invest and innovate, we'll change how we plan, how we operate and how we fight. But we'll never change what we're willing to fight for: for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies and for the values and principles that have produced security, stability and prosperity for all for so long.

With the help of the Navy League and many others in this room, we'll continue to do that for years to come. Thank you so much for being here.

"Nov. 11, 2014","Every year, we set aside Veterans Day to honor all the men and women who’ve served our country in uniform.  We celebrate veterans from generations past.  We welcome a new generation of veterans home from war.  And we thank our future veterans, still serving at home and abroad. They are securing our nation through their engagement across the globe.  Some are in West Africa, contributing to the global effort to stop the spread of Ebola.  Some are in the Middle East, working closely with our coalition partners in the fight against ISIL.  And some are in Afghanistan, where next month the United States will responsibly end the longest war in our history. For our troops serving around the world today, and those transitioning out of the military, our obligations are only beginning.  Taking care of them, and their families, is a sacred responsibility we must always uphold. Let’s celebrate them by telling their stories.  Let’s help those who need it, while supporting their strength and resilience.  And let’s honor our veterans by creating new opportunities for them to contribute after their service, so they can continue making a difference in the world. To all our veterans – thank you.  Thank you for everything you’ve done for our country.  You’re among the best our nation has to offer.  God bless you and your families, and happy Veterans Day.

"June 30, 2016","What a spectacular looking group, and particularly for the kids. Thank you for your patience. I’ll be brief, but it’s important and I hope that you’ll remember some of it. Lieutenant Colonel Farooq, thank you for that kind introduction. I want to thank Secretary Fanning, Eric, thanks for being here also, and welcome all of our international friends who are joining us. To our Turkish allies who are with us today this evening, my thoughts and prayers are with you, and with the families and friends of those affected by the attack in Istanbul this week. It was an attack on us all, and I want to assure you that the people of the United States stand with the extraordinary people of Turkey at this difficult time. I also want to thank Imam Zia Makhdoom , Imam thank you, for honoring us with your presence, thank you. Finally I want to thank Chaplain Kenneth Williams and his staff for helping to make this wonderful event a reality, as they have for so many other gatherings of faith at the Pentagon through the year, from Good Friday, to Purim, to Diwali, to Vaisakhi and every week at the Pentagon prayer breakfast, thank you. The Department of Defense is one family of many faiths, and this is a family gathering. So thank you for welcoming me and my wife Stephanie, and Ramadan Kareem to all of the Muslim servicemembers and civilians within our department. This Ramadan includes the longest days of the year, so I’m going to be brief so you can break your fast soon. But I want to note that this Ramadan also includes the 4th of July, the day our nation was born of the self-evident truths that we’re all created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All of us. Right now, right now as we’re here this evening, there are thousands of Muslim-American Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen serving and defending those ideals in every time zone, in the air, ashore, and afloat. They stand in a long line of patriots who have stepped forward throughout our history to pursue the noblest of callings, which is to protect our people, uphold humankind’s highest values, and make a better world for our children. They, and their remarkable military families, serve in the footsteps of the extraordinary Muslim-American veterans with us today, like Sheikh Nazeem Abdul Karriem, who fought on the beaches of Normandy. Sir, thank you again for being here. And Imam Ghayth Kashif, who fought in the Korean War and continues to find ways to serve today. Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you for your service, and thank you for being with us today. Those who serve today also follow the legacy of our fallen heroes, brave Muslim-Americans like Specialist Kareem Rashad Khan, who died serving our nation in Baqouba, Iraq. To his mother Elsheba, I thank you for honoring us with your presence. We know we lack the words to do justice to what you feel as we remember your remarkable son. We can never fully know. But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to this nation, and to a world that still depends so much on American men and women in uniform for its security. And we are profoundly grateful. It has been said that security is like oxygen: if you have it, you don’t think about it. But if you don’t have it that’s all you can think of. The Muslim-Americans who now serve our nation in uniform, as well as the many more who support their mission in a civilian capacity, play a critical role in providing that oxygen to the world, alongside their fellow servicemembers and colleagues of every faith and every background. When I became Secretary of Defense, I made a commitment to building America’s force of the future – the all-volunteer military that will defend our nation for generations to come and that will be in the future as it is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And like our outstanding force of today, our force of the future must continue to benefit from the best people America has to offer. In the 21st century, that requires drawing strength from the broadest pool of possible talent. That’s why we’ve opened all combat positions to women who can meet our standards. And it’s why we must continue to find ways of recruiting, training and retaining the finest Americans from every community and every background in this country. To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from any part of the country that has talent and skills. And drawing from all of our strengths increases the experience and perspective of the force. For some of your fellow servicemembers or colleagues, you may have been the first Muslim they’ve gotten to know well. And so you’ve already given them a perspective they never had before, just as they’ve probably expanded your perspective as well. That expanded perspective is critical to our mission of national defense, because it allows our men and women to thrive in uncertain situations, to understand and respect differences, and to work with others to solve seemingly intractable problems,  to create new partnerships, and to build new coalitions.  It spurs innovation, and builds bridges. When I visit with foreign leaders I often hear how much they like to work with our men and women in uniform, not only because they’re very capable, but because they conduct themselves decently, they’re trustworthy, and they live our values —including respecting differences, and finding strength in them.  Those are values that many nations around the world find to be honorable, decent, and attractive to themselves. Many of you know what that means firsthand, whether you’ve helped harden our networks in the cyber domain as some of you have, or conducted exercises with our allies in the waters of the Asia Pacific, or responded to a disaster in some far off corner of the globe, your individual actions are a clear reflection of our values and our leadership.  “Strength in Faith, and Character in Service” are not just themes for tonight’s celebration, they are part of the foundation that enables everything we do around the world. This is particularly important as we work to counter the insidious influence of organizations that seek to subvert the meaning of Islam to inspire violence and destruction. The men and women here tonight, and those observing Ramadan on every ship and every base around the world, are the most powerful argument against the twisted ideology of ISIL, Al Qaeda and any other terrorist organizations of any origin that seek to hijack faith in order to promote their brand of evil. We all stand firm in the service of our nation to defend the very freedoms that bind us together as Americans – not only the freedom of religion – but liberty and justice for all.  And it is through our resolve and enduring commitment to global peace and security that we will, we will, we’re sure to overcome any threats to our way of life, and the corrupt ideologies that may underpin them. Our annual Pentagon Iftar recognizes the true spirit of Ramadan, a time when Muslims recommit themselves to their faith, following days of sacrifice, discipline and patience with nights of gratitude.  It is a time of renewal, a reminder of one’s duty to serve one another, and to lift up the less fortunate.  So, I am honored to spend my evening with you to honor the values we share: peace, charity, and forgiveness.  And I am profoundly grateful to you and your families for your service and sacrifice here at home and around the world – that’s each and every one of you, including each and every one of the kids here. So as we break the fast, let us give thanks for the opportunity to defend and live in a country founded on the principles of freedom of religion, tolerance, and mutual respect. Let us give thanks to those who have fought and died for those freedoms. And let us give thanks to God for the blessings that we share. May God bless all of you, may God bless all of our troops, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.

"Nov. 24, 2014","Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for your generous words, your friendship and support, which I have always valued and will continue to value. To my not old but my longtime dear friend Vice President Biden, who I have always admired and respected – and both the President and I have learned an awful lot from the Vice President over the years – thank you. And I want to thank the Deputy Secretary of Defense, who is here, Bob Work, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Marty Dempsey, who is also here. I want to thank them for being here this morning.  I also want to thank you both for your tremendous leadership of the Defense Department and what you mean to our men and women and their families all over the world, and for the honor I’ve had to serve with each of you, and the privilege it’s – it’s been in every way. And I want to thank the entire leadership team at the Pentagon.  Without their support and wise counsel over the last couple of years, our many accomplishments – and the President noted some – I have been part of that, but it’s a team.  It’s all these tremendous men and women, as you know, Mr. President, that make this happen, and I couldn’t be prouder of them and what we have accomplished over the almost two years that I’ve had the honor of serving in this position. And as the President noted, I have today submitted my resignation as Secretary of Defense.  It’s been the greatest privilege of my life – the greatest privilege of my life – to lead and, most important, to serve – to serve with the men and women of the Defense Department and support their families. I am immensely proud of what we’ve accomplished during this time. We have prepared ourselves – as the President has noted – our allies, and Afghan National Security Forces for a successful transition in Afghanistan.  We’ve bolstered enduring alliances and strengthened emerging partnerships, while successfully responding to crises around the world.  And we’ve launched important reforms that the President noted – reforms that will prepare this institution for the challenges facing us in decades to come. I believe we have set not only this Department – the Department of Defense – but the nation on a stronger course toward security, stability, and prosperity.  If I didn’t believe that, I would not have done this job. As our country prepares to celebrate Thanksgiving, I want you, Mr. President, and you, Vice President Biden…acknowledge what you have done and how grateful I am to both of you for your leadership and your friendship…and for giving me this opportunity to serve our country again.  I will continue to support you, Mr. President, and the men and women who defend this country every day so unselfishly – and their families – what they do for our country so unselfishly. And as I have said, and as the President noted, I will stay on this job and work just as hard as I have over the last couple of years every day, every moment until my successor is confirmed by the United States Senate. I’d also like to express my gratitude to our colleagues on Capitol Hill – my gratitude to them for their support of me, but more importantly their support of our troops and their families, and their continued commitment to our national security. I also want to thank my international counterparts for their friendship and their partnership and their advice during my time as Secretary of Defense.  Their involvement with me and their partnership with me in so many of these important areas as we build these coalitions of common interest, as you have noted Mr. President, are so critically important.  And to them, I am grateful. I will be forever grateful. And finally, I’d like to thank my family: my wife, Lilibet, who you have mentioned, Mr. President, who is with me this morning, as she has been with me throughout so many years and during so many tremendous experiences. And this experience and opportunity and privilege to serve as Secretary of Defense has been one of those.  And my daughter, Allyn, and my son, Ziller. Mr. President, again, thank you to you and to all of our team everywhere.  And as we know, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, it is a team effort.  And that’s the – part of the fun of it, to help build teams and to work together to make things happen for the good of the country and make a better world.  For all of that, I’m immensely grateful. And to all of you, your families: Happy Thanksgiving.  Thank you very much.

"Dec. 10, 2016","Well, thank you, John, for that introduction.  It’s great to see you again, to speak at this important IISS forum, and to be back in Bahrain with so many good friends, allies, and partners here in this room. I’m in the middle of a two-week around-the-world trip,  visiting U.S. troops as holiday time approaches – in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe – and also meeting with some of America’s most enduring and loyal friends and allies in each region. It’s a trip that’s emblematic of the five immediate, distinct, and evolving challenges the men and women of the U.S. military are confronting today.  They’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  And here in the Middle East, they’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence, and helping defend our friends and allies ; and they’re countering terrorism and accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL.  And at the same time as they deal with this complex present, they’re also preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring America’s military is ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. Having visited Japan, India, and Afghanistan, I’m now beginning a series of stops here in the Middle East.  And I want to talk to you today about America’s approach to the region, and why it remains critical that it continue. My first trip overseas after taking office was to the Middle East, and this marks my seventh trip to the region as Secretary of Defense.  And like many other U.S. defense officials, it’s just the latest in many more such trips over the course of my long career – a testament to my department’s commitment to, and leadership in, this region. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Defense has a long history of engagement and partnership in the Middle East – not only strategically, but in personal ways as well.  Generations of U.S. troops and Defense Department civilians have spent time here.  Over the decades, servicemembers from the United States and nations in the region have trained together in joint exercises.  They’ve studied together at war colleges.  They’ve served together across the region – on land, in the air, and at sea.  And they’ve sacrificed together in battle.  Through it all, they’ve forged relationships – soldier-to-soldier, sailor-to-sailor, airman-to-airman, Marine-to-Marine – that go on to last a lifetime, adding sinew to the muscle of our partnerships as they ascend the ranks of our militaries. Today, this region is home to a strong U.S. military posture comprising over 58,000 American personnel ashore and afloat – including more than 5,000 on the ground in Iraq and Syria – along with some of our most capable air, ground, maritime, and ballistic missile defense assets.  Those forces are not only countering terrorists like ISIL and Al-Qaeda; they’re also deterring aggression and protecting our interests and allies.  In addition, if needed in a crisis, this large force posture here would be joined by a rapid surge of an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities and platforms married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. The reason for all this, and the logic of American strategy in the Middle East, is worth taking some time to explain.  This can be a region of great turbulence, confusion, and internal strife – challenges that spill outside the region, including in the form of terrorism – much more so than any other region of the world.  But amid all this confusion, I can assure you that the Defense Department is clear and certain about our mission: it is to protect and pursue America’s national interests.  They’re our North Star – the guiding light for America’s strategy in the Middle East. Our interests are first and foremost protecting our people.  And accordingly they extend to: deterring aggression; bolstering the security of our allies and friends in and around the region; ensuring freedom of navigation in and around the Gulf; preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and checking Iran’s destabilizing activities; and also – very directly connected to the protection of the American people – countering terrorism and violent extremism, which at the moment especially includes defeating ISIL. Now, I need to say – and it’s as true here as it is anywhere else in the world – that America’s interests are not always exactly the same as those of individual nations in the region – nor are theirs among themselves.  But more often than not, they overlap or can be aligned.  When they do, it’s good for the United States, and good for many countries here, too.  And our interests overlap so often that more and more, we’ve been able to operate together to be effective. Our enduring interests are why the Defense Department’s commitment to this part of the world has been lasting and has been sustained for decade after decade, and why I’m confident it will endure for decade after decade.  As I’ll discuss today, the way in which our countries have dealt with shared challenges past and present – together, in pursuit of mutual interests – suggests how we will need to do so in the future. We’ve been able to do this most effectively where America has led by first building the capacity of, and then enabling, the forces of allies and friends in the region – so that they can maintain lasting security both within and between states, in tandem with the awesome capabilities of the U.S. military.  The most recent example of this, of course, is how we’re countering the latest and most immediate threat in the region, which is ISIL.  Because ISIL arose from and also threatens this region, its impending defeat is an example of the U.S. military, as part of a global coalition, enabling local forces to deliver the lasting defeat it deserves to ISIL and that it will certainly receive.  And to make that defeat stick. We’ve reached a critical milestone in the counter-ISIL coalition’s military campaign plan.  As we meet today in Bahrain, American and coalition forces are engaged in an intense effort to help isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over both Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, bringing the great weight of our entire range of capabilities to bear on the enabling of capable and motivated local forces.  The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria – the primary objective of our military campaign – and put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat. Reaching this milestone is the result of deliberate actions taken since last year.  First, back in the summer of 2015, I consolidated the war efforts for Iraq and Syria under a single, unified command – first led by Lieutenant General Sean McFarland then General Townsend – reporting, I should say, to Joe Votel, who reports to me.  Joe’s here today – hi, Joe.  Then, last October, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford and I developed, and President Obama approved, the first in a series of recommendations to accelerate the campaign against ISIL – introducing every tool of the U.S. military to this fight.  And I should tell you that since then, President Obama has approved every recommendation for additional forces and capabilities that the Chairman and I have taken to him as we’ve seen opportunities to accelerate the campaign – including just last week, as I’ll detail momentarily. The overall Coalition Military Campaign Plan we devised last year had, and continues to have, three objectives.  The first is to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, because the sooner we crush both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology, the safer we’ll be.  That’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient.  So the second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world: in Afghanistan, Libya, and elsewhere.  And the third objective is to work with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners to help protect our homelands and our people from attack. The strategic approach of our military campaign in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere is to leverage all the tools at our disposal to enable capable, motivated, local forces to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  It was necessary to recommend this strategic approach because the only way to ensure that once ISIL is defeated, it stays defeated, is to enable local forces to seize and hold territory rather than substitute for them.  Consistent with this approach, we have employed some of the U.S. military’s most exquisite capabilities, and some of our most specialized personnel – from air power and special operations forces, to train, advise, assist capabilities on the ground, to intelligence and cyber tools.  These assets have been able to not only help directly enable local forces on the ground; they can also bring to bear the full weight of the American and coalition military might. By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we’ve been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum.  For example, when U.S. and coalition special operators conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders, it creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence. This, in turn, generates more targets, more raids, more airstrikes, and more opportunities that can be seized to generate even more momentum. And countries from across the counter-ISIL coalition, including some in the region, are contributing to these military efforts.  Many in the Middle East host coalition forces, enabling us to bring to bear our force more efficiently.  Some are also contributing on the ground, or have contributed in the air campaign.  And countries closest to the fight are making a key difference – including Jordan and Turkey.  Turkey, for example, hosts coalition strike aircraft at Incirlik, as well as a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, at Gazientep.  And Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is helping to seal the Turkish-Syrian border so that ISIL can no longer exploit it. As a result of all of this, since last year – play by play, accelerant on top of accelerant, town after town, from every direction and in every domain – the campaign has delivered significant results. In Iraq, U.S. and coalition forces have been helping the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to systematically dislodge ISIL from city after city – Ramadi, Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Mahkmur, and Qayyarah, just to name a few.  And the coalition is now doing the same in Mosul – having isolated the city, the Iraqis with our help are now taking back neighborhoods in eastern Mosul and moving west.  This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered. In Syria, we and our local partners put an end to ISIL’s expansion and then began to systematically roll it back toward Raqqa, an important objective since it is the so-called capital of the so-called caliphate, and a hub for plotters of external attacks.  After helping capable, motivated, local Syrian partners defend Kobani, we enabled them and other local forces to retake Shaddadi, Tishrin Dam, Manbij, Jarabulus, and Dabiq – not only denying ISIL control over those areas, but also cutting off some of its primary lines of communication into Iraq and Syria – excuse me, Iraq and Turkey.  We’re now helping tens of thousands of local Syrian forces to isolate Raqqa, from which they’re now only 15 miles away.  And as the isolation phase continues according to plan, we’re helping them generate the additional local forces necessary to seize and to hold that city. Now, to ensure the success of isolating Raqqa, generate sufficient local forces to seize Raqqa, and deny ISIL sanctuary beyond Raqqa, I can tell you today that the United States will deploy approximately 200 additional U.S. forces to Syria, including special operations forces trainers, advisors, and explosive ordnance disposal teams.  These uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL, and are also bringing down the full weight of U.S. forces around the theater of operations like the funnel of a giant tornado.  This latest commitment of additional forces within Syria is another important step in enabling our partners to deal ISIL a lasting defeat. Meanwhile, in addition to taking back territory, the campaign is yielding results in denying ISIL the finances, supplies, freedom of movement, and command-and-control it needs to survive.  As a coalition, we’ve systematically targeted ISIL-controlled oil wells, trucks for smuggling the oil – including just on Thursday, 168 trucks in a single strike, the largest air strike of this kind to date – and we’ve also targeted revenue repositories as well.  We’ve deliberately focused on severing the territory ISIL controls in Syria from the territory it controls in Iraq.  Leaders of the terrorist group can no longer travel between Raqqa and Mosul without the risk of either being struck from the air or hunted down by the coalition’s Expeditionary Targeting Force.  In fact, since we began accelerating our campaign last year, we’ve killed the majority of ISIL’s most senior leaders. While these results in Iraq and Syria are encouraging, the coalition must stay focused on the continued execution of the campaign plan.  The inevitable collapse of ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa will certainly put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat – but there will still be much more to do after that to make sure that, once defeated, ISIL stays defeated. We’ll need to continue to counter foreign fighters trying to escape and ISIL’s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself.  To do so, not only the United States, but the coalition must  remain engaged.  In Iraq in particular, it will be necessary for the coalition to provide sustained assistance to Iraqi Security Forces to consolidate security over the rest of the country and carry on our work to train, equip, and support local police, border guards, and other forces to hold areas cleared from ISIL – as always, with the full support and permission of the government of Iraq. Beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Those aren’t military matters, but they’re part of how, after winning the battle, you win the peace.  That’s why my principal concern at this juncture is that the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts will lag behind the military campaign.  As I emphasized when I met with my Gulf counterparts in Riyadh this past April, this is an area where countries in the region can really do some good. There will also need to be continued political support for an inclusive and multi-sectarian Iraq.  In a region where sectarianism is on the rise, the threat of ISIL has brought people together against this common enemy.  That’s certainly true in Iraq – where, thanks to the unity and leadership of Prime Minister Abadi and Kurdish Regional Government President Barzani, cooperation between the Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga in the battle to retake Mosul has reached a level that would have been unthinkable a year ago.  About six weeks ago, for example, I was in Erbil and met Iraqi Army attack helicopter pilots who were flying missions against ISIL from Kurdish territory.  And today, the coalition is taking steps to help promote and maintain this unity – for we know that’s the only way to ensure ISIL will stay defeated.  Political support for this unity is another way that countries in this region could make a difference. In Syria, however, even with the seizure of Raqqa and defeat of ISIL, the violence won’t stop until an end is put to the tragic civil war there.  Russia entered into the civil war saying they wanted to promote a smooth political transition in Syria that preserved the structure of the Syrian state, which I understand, and which is necessary to ending the Syrian civil war and restoring decent life to that tragically shattered country.  And Russia said it would fight ISIL.  But then it did neither of those things, and instead have only inflamed the civil war and prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people. Now, as I said earlier, success against ISIL in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  And that’s why the coalition, and the Department of Defense, is also focused on other critical objectives of our campaign – combatting ISIL’s metastases around the world, and helping protect our homelands and people. When it comes to combatting the metastases, the U.S. military has taken correspondingly strong actions in support of capable, motivated local forces in Libya, and Afghanistan.  In Libya, we’ve provided air support to the Government of National Accord and its forces to isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over Sirte.  And as a result, ISIL has been ejected from Sirte.  And in Afghanistan – where I just came from last night – at Chairman Dunford’s and my recommendation, President Obama this year gave expanded authorities to U.S. forces to proactively assist and enable our Afghan partners in operations that would have strategic effects.  He also decided to modify our plan in order to retain some 8,400 U.S. troops there into 2017, rather than 5,500 as the earlier plan had called for.  And the United States will continue to maintain its financial commitment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.  These robust commitments in authorities, forces, and finances – which are reinforced by pledges made by NATO – will ensure we not only continues supporting the Afghan security forces, but also sustains our regional counter-terrorism platform in Afghanistan.  For example, alongside Afghan partners, U.S. forces recently conducted two large-scale operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, killing its top leader in the country and significantly degrading its capabilities there.  Earlier this year, we killed Mullah Mansour, the leader of the Afghan Taliban.  And we also took out the leader of an Al-Qaeda cell that was plotting against the U.S. homeland. On our campaign plan’s third objective, protecting our homelands and people, the Defense Department is working closely with partners in intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement both at home and abroad.  Here, coalition forces are conducting operations to gather intelligence with a particular focus on destroying ISIL’s external operations cadre.  As a result, we’ve not only killed the chief of ISIL’s external operations, but also taken out over 30 of its external plotters. Now, of course, America has not been doing all this alone.  The counter-ISIL coalition has been decisive and effective, with over a third of the forces in the campaign coming from partners other than the United States.  And that’s to be expected, since countering ISIL as a coalition was a purposeful and practical decision – because there are so many countries resolved to destroy the threat ISIL poses to all of them. Now, even as we know how this fight will end in Iraq and Syria, the coalition must prepare to counter not only the threat posed by foreign fighters, but also any attempts by ISIL to survive by reinventing itself in some other shape or form.  Whether it tries to mutate into a terrorist network that’s scattered across the globe, or a skeleton organization that lies in wait in the sands of the desert, or even a violent extremist movement that lives and lurks only in the darkest corners of the Internet, we cannot perfectly predict what will happen after the coalition defeats ISIL in Iraq and Syria.  So we must be ready for anything. And that’s why, as I mentioned, the coalition must endure and must remain engaged militarily even after the inevitable expulsion of ISIL from Mosul and Raqqa.  We all came together, deliberately, as a coalition to defeat ISIL, and it will be necessary for that coalition to continue to work together, contribute together, and operate together to make sure ISIL’s defeat is a lasting one.  I look forward to discussing this with many of my counterparts in the region this week, and also next week, when defense ministers from the leading military contributors to the counter-ISIL coalition will gather in London. Now as we look beyond the defeat of ISIL – which to be lasting will require, just to repeat, a continued counterterrorism effort – it’s clear the counter-ISIL campaign is emblematic of how the U.S. Defense Department pursues U.S. interests in the Middle East – interests we pursue without hesitation, but that often align with those of friends and allies here.  And it gives witness to how our enduring commitment to the region provides unique value. Indeed, it’s abundantly clear that no other nation could have brought to bear the resources, assembled the coalition, and led the execution of a comprehensive campaign as America has done in this fight, to pursue this goal that we all share.  And the way the United States has done so, both against ISIL and in the broader Middle East – using our awesome military power., but also supporting and enabling friends and allies, building the capacity of partners, and encouraging and helping them to develop their own capabilities – recognizes the fact that success can only be lasting if local forces secure territory and local governance takes hold.  So focusing on local forces, enabled by the United States, is key to our strategic approach.  That defines the nature of our military’s enduring commitment here. Moreover, the counter-ISIL coalition military campaign I’ve described, and its results, happened despite America’s major, simultaneous, and also growing military commitments in Europe and Asia – where U.S. forces have been deterring Russian aggression against NATO allies in Europe, standing guard on the Korean Peninsula, and rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region.  And, moreover, in this region, in addition to the counter-ISIL campaign, America also underwrote the international strategy that resulted in last year’s agreement that verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  And even as we all monitor Iran’s implementation of the nuclear accord, the Defense Department has maintained and, yes, strengthened its posture to deter aggression, act in any contingency, and stand strong with regional allies and friends to counter Iran’s malign and destabilizing activities.  And also, when Saudi Arabia’s territory was threatened from Yemen, the United States helped to defend it, while also countering Al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen and simultaneously pushing for a political process that will help restore stability in that country. Now, while the U.S.-led counter-ISIL campaign proceeds according to our plan, the overall region’s response to the threat from ISIL shows some imperfections.  While the United States, NATO countries, and the Iraqi government – including the Kurdish Regional Government – have taken leading roles in this fight, some of the regional powers here in the Middle East have not lived up to the full potential one would expect given their history, geographic location, and stake in the outcome.  Such regional powers could do more, and indeed are uniquely positioned to help those of us who live outside the region to enable local forces in the fight against ISIL – particularly in the political and economic aspects of the campaign.  In other cases, though, those powers here themselves lack the necessary capability to play a larger role.  So the United States is helping them build up their capabilities and capacity as well, through our longstanding defense partnerships in the region. Now, given the Middle East’s unique history and character, security relationships here have never been defined by a formal, NATO-like structure spanning the entire region.  That’s why the Defense Department’s engagement in the region has most often been through bilateral relationships. Many of those relationships are time-tested friendships and alliances as old as half a century or more.  And they not only still continue to thrive; some are even reaching new heights. Our security cooperation with Saudi Arabia, for example, goes back over six decades’ worth of building institutional capacity, honing interoperability, and combating mutual threats.  And we’re helping bolster their capabilities in several ways – most recently with advanced F-15SA fighter jets, the first of which will be delivered next week. Bahrain, too, is a venerable partner here in the Gulf, being home to one of America’s oldest defense relationships in the region.  Bahrain hosts our Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and the headquarters of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, which I’ll be visiting later today – helping ensure maritime security not only in the Gulf, but also the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and parts of the Indian Ocean. And moving beyond the Gulf for a moment, Jordan is also among our oldest security partners – and today, it’s one of the U.S. military’s most steadfast and invaluable and capable allies in the region, especially its special operations forces.  And Jordan also hosts the largest military exercise in the region, EAGER LION, with some 3,000 rotational U.S. troops participating each year. Another of our oldest allies in the region, of course, is Israel – with whom our defense relationship is unwavering, and stronger than ever.  In September, our countries signed a new 10-year security assistance memorandum, taking our partnership to an unprecedented level.  And I’ll be visiting Israel next week, to deliver its first two F-35 stealth fighters. We’ve also had a long history of engagement with Lebanon, where there’s been improvement in their forces over the last decade.  After Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon in 200[5], the Defense Department’s security assistance for Lebanon’s military and special forces has advanced a range of interests to help counter the spread of ISIL and al-Nusra, and stem the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. And there are also deep roots to our security cooperation with Egypt – a historical leader in the region, with an important strategic role in stability here. Now, while America’s other partnerships in the region are relatively newer, these relationships too have significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these nations host U.S. forces and share their costs.  And with our help, they’ve been steadily advancing their capabilities. Our security cooperation with Kuwait, for instance, grew in earnest in the 1991 Gulf War, and has since continuously increased.  Last month, we announced our intent to sell F-18 fighter jets to Kuwait – greatly enhancing Kuwait’s capability to provide for its national defense, operate better alongside U.S. forces, and enable Kuwait to take on a larger share of regional security responsibilities. Qatar is another Gulf country where our partnership has accelerated over the last several years.  It hosts our Combined Air Operations Center, which is critical to managing the coalition air campaigns over Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.  And our militaries are increasingly interoperable in air, land, and ballistic missile defense – in fact, just this week, we reached an agreement for Qatar to purchase a 5,000-kilometer early-warning radar to enhance its missile defenses. And this brings me to the United Arab Emirates, which unquestionably has one of the most capable militaries in the Middle East, and a truly excellent bilateral relationship with us that’s growing stronger and more institutionalized every day.  The UAE not only acquires effective capabilities; it puts skin in the game.  This makes the UAE a key partner for the United States. And last but not least is Iraq, where – as we’ve seen from the results of the counter-ISIL campaign – where our partnership and the Iraqi Security Forces have never been more effective.  The U.S. military has brought its own capabilities to bear, while also helping the Iraqis to do so as well.  And as I mentioned earlier, it will be necessary for the United States and the counter-ISIL coalition to maintain our commitment to strengthening the Iraqi Security Forces, so that they can secure and control Iraq’s borders and ensure that ISIL cannot resurrect itself in Iraq. The result of all this is that as we’ve helped our partners build their capacity bilaterally, it’s translated into greater ability for them also to act multilaterally – making the whole greater than the sum of the parts, and helping to advance our mutual interests.  Across the region, we’ve been building and strengthening connections with countries and militaries so we can all plan together, exercise and train together, and as necessary fight together, more efficiently and effectively than ever before. We’ve seen this in the counter-ISIL campaign, with countries in the region having contributed to the air campaign, contributing on the ground to help train and enable local forces, and hosting coalition forces. We’ve also seen it in the waters in and around the Gulf, where Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and others participate in multilateral maritime coalitions to counter piracy, counter terrorism, and help ensure freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. And we see it in the dozens of bilateral and multilateral exercises our militaries conduct together each year, across a wide range of disciplines and physical domains.  These are helping build interoperability and coordination in areas like explosive ordnance disposal, de-mining, integrated air and missile defense, tactical air operations, naval operations, combined arms, and special operations. Overall, the Defense Department is seeking to bolster the region’s security by making sure America’s partners here are powerful, strong, and capable of providing not only for their own needs, but also for the greater region, with the U.S. military always prepared to stand by their side.  And more than advancing American interests, it’s also how the United States is most effective in security cooperation in the 21st century.  We’re supporting allies, friends, and regional security architectures in ways that help them grow stronger and more integrated, but are also tailored to the needs and traditions of the respective regions. Here in the Middle East, it’s clear that what the Defense Department has done to help regional partners grow more capable and engaged has been good for the United States and for its partners – it’s benefited the interests of all of us.  Going forward, it will be necessary to do more, as our countries must work together more to close critical shortfalls in core regional capabilities – particularly ground forces, special operations forces, naval forces, ballistic missile defenses, and cyber defense. The fact is, if countries in the region are worried about Iran’s destabilizing activities – a concern the United States shares – they need to get in the game.  That means getting serious about starting to partner more with each other, and investing in the right capabilities for the threat.  Given the persistent challenges facing the region – and because the future is always uncertain – developing these core capabilities will be ever more crucial to your security.  And you ignore them at your peril. On a positive note, there has been some progress since May of last year, when President Obama hosted a summit between the United States and Gulf Cooperation Council nations at Camp David, and which was followed by a defense ministerial and summit between our countries in Riyadh this past April. First, to strengthen the capability of ground forces in the region – starting with special operations forces and counterterrorism forces, to better counter asymmetric threats – we’re continuing to design and implement a Special Operations Response Force Initiative that pairs elite special operations units from GCC states with U.S. forces to improve interoperability and enhance joint planning.  To further improve our ground forces, we must also focus on logistics, reconstruction and stabilization, and counterinsurgency missions – that is to say, all the ingredients of achieving lasting victory. Next, we’ve also made progress in the maritime domain, as different GCC states, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have recently commanded Combined Task Force-152, one of the maritime task forces designed to patrol and secure the waters of the Gulf.  In the last year, U.S. and coalition forces have interdicted four vessels covertly carrying illicit weapons from Iran, likely destined for Yemen.  Meanwhile, through our robust naval presence here in Bahrain, the U.S. Navy continues to train with Gulf navies in a variety of exercises.  And to improve even more, we invite all Gulf countries to participate in joint patrols, so that we can operate together even more seamlessly, and bolster our shared situational awareness. Additionally, the progress we’ve made in improving ballistic missile defense is also important, as Iran continues to test and field such missiles in defiance of the U.N. Security Council.  That’s why we’re working together to develop a blueprint for a regional ballistic missile defense architecture that would help integrate capabilities across the region – from the Patriot batteries deployed in several countries, to the Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense, THAAD, system in the UAE, to Qatar’s future early-warning radar, and to more systems yet to come. And finally, we’ve also made progress on cyber defense.  As Iran demonstrated a capability in cyber operations, and violent extremists and sub-state actors have been exploiting the Internet, we’ve conducted assessments with several countries in the region to help them further develop cyber defense strategies and policy, identify critical infrastructure vulnerable to attack, and build expert cyber workforces to close those vulnerabilities. While all this progress is good, it will be necessary to build on it going forward. To be sure, the United States and its friends in the Middle East have a rich, proud history of mutual sacrifices, enduring commitments, and most importantly, frequently aligned interests.  However, our allies and partners in this part of the world are the ones who live here, and we can’t substitute for them – we can help, but only they can ensure lasting security.  That’s an important fact.  And that’s why it must be said – as I’ve said to my counterparts many times before – that mutual interest requires mutual commitment. It’s not unreasonable to expect any country to do more to advance its own interests.  And I would ask you to imagine what U.S. military and defense leaders think when they have to listen to complaints sometimes that we should do more, when it’s plain to see that all too often, the ones complaining aren’t doing enough themselves. While the Defense Department’s commitment to this region has endured across strategic eras and across presidential administrations, we should all remember that our security partnerships are inherently two-way streets.  It will be necessary for countries in the region to not only help prevent them from growing excessively one-sided, but also to counter such perceptions. Let me close by reaffirming that today, as ever, the Department of Defense has the capacity and resolve to remain the best security partner for this region, and the logic of our mutual commitment to engaging – that I’ve laid out here – is so sound that it will continue. After all, there’s a reason why we’ve continued to work together – why time and again, countries in the Middle East choose to do the most, buy the most, exercise the most, and operate the most with the United States Department of Defense.  They want to work with us because we’re awesomely capable, principled, and, to be blunt, there aren’t any good alternatives.  We’re the most reliable. Regardless of what happens elsewhere in the world or in the United States, our military will continue to have the will and the capacity to meet our obligations in this region.  That’s because the United States has interests here that it cannot walk away from.  And they’re the real reasons why this region will always matter – the necessity to deter aggression, to help defend our allies and friends, uphold freedom of navigation, counter proliferation, and counter terrorism and violent extremism.  No matter how the United States engages, all of these are longstanding, enduring national interests that time and again the Defense Department has shown it can and will defend and uphold – not only in this region, but in others as well.  That has, and will, remain the case. Having worked myself for over 30 years in support of our military's missions around the world – including for nearly a dozen defense secretaries in both Democratic and Republican administrations, as well as now being Secretary of Defense myself – and having faced defense budgets both copious and constrained, in times of war, peace, and everything in between, including amid great turbulence in this region, I’ve always seen the U.S. Department of Defense remain engaged and committed here for a simple reason: because it’s good for America and America’s security interests, and it’s good for countries here and for their interests as well.  That’s as true today as ever, and I’m confident it will stay true in the years to come. Thank you.

"March 18, 2015","Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, Members of the Committee:  thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget request for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Oversight is key to our system of government.  I not only welcome your wisdom and experience; I also want your partnership, and need your help. I also want to thank Chairman Dempsey for his leadership, as well as Deputy Secretary Work and Vice Chairman Winnefeld, in particular for all their hard work over the past year in helping develop the budget request we will be discussing today.  I. INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGY During my first week as Secretary of Defense, I had the opportunity to see our troops in Afghanistan and Kuwait.  Hearing from them was one of my highest priorities upon taking office. In Afghanistan, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are helping cement progress made toward a more secure, stable, and prosperous future, by training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and continuing their counter-terrorism mission.  They are working to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our homeland, or on our partners and allies. In Kuwait, our men and women in uniform are contributing to our counter-ISIL coalition in Iraq and Syria.  They are working closely with Iraq and our global coalition partners to ensure that local forces can deliver lasting defeat to a vile enemy that has barbarically murdered American citizens, Iraqis, Syrians, and so many others, and that seeks to export its hateful and twisted ideology across the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. No doubt the challenges and opportunities we face extend well beyond the Middle East. In Europe, our troops are helping reinforce and reassure our allies in Eastern Europe as we confront a reversion to archaic security thinking. In the Asia-Pacific – home to half the world’s population and economy – they are working to modernize our alliances, build new partnerships, and helping the United States continue to underwrite stability, peace, and prosperity in the region – as we have for decades. And as we still meet longtime challenges, such as the continuing imperative to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction, our armed forces are also addressing new dangers, such as in cyberspace.  As I told our elite cyber warriors when I visited them at Cyber Command last week, they are not just pioneers on the frontier of technology.  They are a force on the front lines – defending our networks, supporting our troops in the field, and preparing for a full range of cyber contingencies. Across the world, in every domain, it is America’s leadership, and America’s men and women in uniform, who often stand between disorder and order – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing behind those who believe in a more secure, just, and prosperous future. Mr. Chairman, this committee and this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so – whether they can continue to defend our nation’s interests around the world with the readiness, capability, and excellence our nation has grown accustomed to, and sometimes taken for granted. Halting and reversing the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. It would ensure we field a modern, ready force in a balanced way, while also embracing change and reform, because asking for more taxpayer dollars requires we hold up our end of the bargain – by ensuring that every dollar is well-spent. The President is proposing to increase the defense budget in Fiscal Year 2016, but in line with the projection he submitted to Congress last year in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget’s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The department is executing the plan it presented last year.  Accordingly, for Fiscal Year 2016, the President is proposing $534 billion for DoD’s base budget and $51 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), totaling $585 billion to sustain America’s national security and defense strategies. The Defense Department needs your support for this budget, which is driven by strategy, not the other way around.  More specifically, it is driven by the defense strategy identified in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which reflects the longtime, bipartisan consensus that our military must protect the homeland, build security globally, and project power and win decisively.  We do so in line with our longstanding tradition of maintaining a superior force with an unmatched technological edge, working in close partnership with friends and allies, upholding the rules-based international order, and keeping our commitments to the people who make up the all-volunteer force. Our defense budget’s priorities line up with our strategic priorities:  sustaining America’s global leadership by:  This budget ensures we can execute our defense strategy with manageable risk, even as it does require us to accept elevated risk in some areas. But – and I want to be clear about this – parts of our nation’s defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration, which remains the law of the land and is set to return 197 days from today. As I have said before, the prospect of sequestration’s serious damage to our national security and economy is tragically not a result of an economic emergency or recession. It is not because these budget cuts are a mathematical solution to the nation’s overall fiscal challenge – they are not. It is not because paths of curbing nondiscretionary spending and reforming our tax system have been explored and exhausted – they have not. It is not due to a breakthrough in military technology or a new strategic insight that somehow makes continued defense spending unnecessary – there has been no such silver bullet. And it is not because the world has suddenly become more peaceful – for it is abundantly clear that it has not. Instead, sequestration is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock.  And friends and potential enemies around the world are watching. We in the Department of Defense are prepared to make difficult strategic and budgetary choices.  We are also committed – more than ever before – to finding new ways to improve the way we do business and be more efficient and accountable in our defense spending. But in order to ensure our military remains the world’s finest fighting force, we need to banish the clouds of fiscal uncertainty that have obscured our plans and forced inefficient choices.  We need a long-term restoration of normal budgeting and a deal that the President can sign, and that lives up to our responsibility of defending this country and the global order.  And that means, among other things, avoiding sequestration. To be sure, even under sequestration, America will remain the world’s strongest military power.  But under sequestration, our military – and our national security – would have to take on irresponsible and unnecessary risk – risk that previous Administrations and Congressional leaders have wisely chosen to avoid. Sequestration would lead over time to a military that looks fundamentally different and performs much differently than what we are used to.  Not only as Secretary of Defense, but simply as an American, I deeply, earnestly hope we can avert that future.  I am committed to working with the members of this committee, and your colleagues throughout the Congress to prevent it. I know how proud you and all Americans are that we field the finest fighting force in the world.  But our military superiority was not built, and will not be sustained, by resting on our laurels.  So instead of resigning ourselves to having the diminished military that sequestration would give us, I propose that we build the force of the future, together.  II. BUILDING THE FORCE OF THE FUTURE Assuming the Congress funds the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget and averts sequestration, we have the opportunity to build the force of the future.  We have inherited a long tradition of military excellence from those who came before us, and we must preserve it for those who will come after. But to do so, DoD must embrace the future – and embrace change – throughout our institution.  We must be open to new ideas and new ways of doing business that can help us operate more efficiently and perform more effectively in an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment. As DoD counters the very real dangers we face in the world, we will also grab hold of the bright opportunities before us – opportunities to be more competitive and re-forge our nation’s military and defense establishment into a future force that harnesses and develops the latest, cutting-edge technology, and that remains superior to any potential adversary; one that is efficient and accountable to the taxpayers who support it; and one that competes and succeeds in attracting the next generation of talented Americans to fill its ranks. These are the three main pillars on which DoD will build the force of the future. Competitiveness through Technological and Operational Superiority As other nations pursue comprehensive military modernization programs and develop technologies designed to blunt our military’s traditional advantages, the first pillar of our future force must be ensuring that we maintain – and extend – our technological edge over any potential adversary. The President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget includes targeted investments in modernized space, cyber, and missile defense capabilities geared toward countering emerging threats that could upend our technological superiority and our ability to project power.  DoD would look forward to providing a full account of our proposed modernization investments, and the threats that compel them, in a classified setting. The budget also supports the Defense Innovation Initiative, which will help ensure the military continues to ride the leading edge of innovation, and makes deferred modernization investments that will ensure America’s nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective.  Across all these efforts, we must be open to global, commercial technology as well, and learn from advances in the private sector. Because we know that technology alone – however advanced – cannot sustain our military’s superiority, just as important is a ruthless focus on operational excellence.  This means using our existing forces and capabilities in new, creative, and fiscally prudent ways to achieve our objectives.  This also means working to develop more innovative and effective strategic and military options for the President, introducing a new and more rapidly responsive global force management model, developing new operational concepts, and reforming and updating all our operational plans. Competitiveness through Accountability & Efficiency The second pillar of building the force of the future requires redoubling our efforts to make DoD more accountable and efficient.  We live in a competitive world and need to be a competitive organization.  If we don’t lean ourselves out and maintain our fighting weight, we have no business asking our fellow citizens for more resources. As I made clear in my confirmation hearing, I cannot suggest greater support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is always spent as well as it should be. American taxpayers rightly have trouble comprehending – let alone supporting – the defense budget when they read of cost overruns, insufficient accounting and accountability, needless overhead, and the like. If we’re asking taxpayers to not only give us half a trillion of their hard-earned dollars, but also give us more than we got last year, we have to demonstrate that we can be responsible with it. We must do all we can to spend their money more wisely and more responsibly.  We must reduce overhead, and we must curb wasteful spending practices wherever they are. DoD has sought to continuously improve our acquisition processes over the past five years, and I am proud myself to have been a part of that effort.  Today, I am recommitting the Defense Department to working both with Congress, and on our own, to find new and more creative ways of stretching our defense dollars to give our troops the weapons and equipment they need. The department’s Better Buying Power initiative is now on its third iteration since I established it in 2010, with Better Buying Power 3.0 focused on achieving dominant capabilities through technical excellence.  I know well and very much appreciate the strong support for acquisition reform demonstrated by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and their Chairmen, and I share their deep desire to achieve real, lasting results that benefit both America’s security and taxpayers. DoD is working closely with committee Members and staff on ways to eliminate some of the burdensome and duplicative administrative requirements levied on our program managers.  To that end, the President’s FY 2016 budget submission includes a number of legislative proposals designed to help streamline the program oversight process.  We look forward to continuing our close partnership with Congress to see these measures implemented. As we sustain our focus on acquisition reform, I believe that DoD must concurrently undertake a wholesale review of our business practices and management systems. Our goal is to identify where we can further reduce the cost of doing business to free up funding for readiness and modernization – ensuring that our energy, focus, and resources are devoted to supporting our frontline operations as much as possible. We intend to work closely with industry partners – who execute or enable many of our programs, logistics, training, administrative, and other functions – throughout this process, both to explore how they could help us accomplish our missions at reduced cost, and because they may have new and innovative ideas worth considering. Additionally, the Defense Department is pursuing creative force structure changes to be more agile and efficient – such as how we’re modernizing our cruisers and restructuring Army aviation.  We’ve established a new Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.  And four previous rounds of efficiency and budget reduction initiatives have yielded approximately $78 billion in projected and actual savings in FY 2016, helping to cushion our defense programs from successive years of budget cuts. We’re also working hard to cut unnecessary overhead: from reducing management headquarters budgets by 20 percent across the department, to divesting excess bases and infrastructure. When DoD recently requested a round of domestic Base Realignment and Closure, Congress asked that we first pursue efficiencies in Europe.  We did.  DoD has approved and is pursuing a broad European Infrastructure Consolidation – which will result in some $500 million in annual recurring savings.  We now need a round of domestic BRAC beginning in Fiscal Year 2017 to address excess infrastructure here at home. Simply put, we have more bases in more places than we need.  We estimate DoD has about 25 percent more infrastructure capacity than necessary.  We must be permitted to divest surplus infrastructure as we reduce and renew force structure.  With projected recurring savings from a new BRAC round totaling some $2 billion a year, it would be irresponsible to cut tooth without also cutting tail. For base communities in question, it’s important to remember that BRAC is often an opportunity to be seized.  Communities have shown that BRAC is ultimately what you make of it, and there are plenty of places that have emerged from it stronger than they were before. Consider Lawrence, Indiana, which took advantage of Fort Harrison’s closure in 1996 to create an enterprise zone, community college, recreational facilities, and commercial sites that in just 7 years not only replaced 100 percent of the jobs lost when the base closed, but created even more. Charleston, South Carolina stepped up when the Charleston Naval Complex closed in 1993, and now is home to more than 80 new industrial and federal agency tenants.  The former naval base is now producing millions of dollars’ worth of goods that are exported to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. And at former Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, the local redevelopment effort has invested $400 million and created more than 6,500 jobs – over six times the number of jobs lost when the base closed in 1993.  It’s now home to scores of businesses, a mixture of private companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. These are just a few examples of what can happen when local leaders, communities, and businesses work together and take advantage of the opportunities for new jobs and new growth after BRAC. One more point on accountability:  Whether we’re improving acquisition or closing bases, it is not enough to simply tell taxpayers that we’re spending their dollars responsibly.  We have to also show them, which is why good cost accounting and financial auditability is so important to me. DoD has made significant progress over the past five years in adding more discipline to our business environment, but there is much work left to be done, and we remain fully committed to our current audit goals. Today, over 90 percent of DoD’s current year, general fund budgetary resources are under some form of financial audit, with the military services all involved and following the model employed by the Marine Corps. We plan to submit every corner of DoD to this kind of audit regimen beginning in FY 2016.  With this foundation, the department will progressively expand the scope of these audits until all our organizations, funds, and financial statements will be under audit in FY 2018, complying with Congress’s statutory direction to be audit ready by the end of FY 2017. There’s a reason why auditing is a basic practice as ancient as the Domesday Book, and it is time that DoD finally lives up to its moral and legal obligation to be accountable to those who pay its bills.  I intend to do everything we can – including holding people to account – to get this done. Competitiveness through Attracting Future Talent Third, but no less important, DoD must be competitive when it comes to attracting new generations of talented and dedicated Americans to our calling of defending the nation. We know how the attacks of September 11th, 2001 motivated so many Americans to want to be part of this noble endeavor.  Going forward, we must ensure our future force can continue to recruit the finest young men and women our country has to offer – military and civilian – like those who serve today. As we do this, we must be mindful that the next generation expects jobs that give them purpose, meaning, and dignity.  They want to be able to make real contributions, have their voices heard, and gain valuable and transferable experience.  We must shape the kind of force they want to be in.  The battle for talent will demand enlightened and agile leaders, new training schemes, new educational opportunities, and new compensation approaches. DoD is already pursuing several initiatives that will help ensure the military is a compelling career option.  In recent years, we’ve been expanding pilot programs that facilitate breaks in service that let our people gain diverse work experience.  We’ve tailored our transition assistance program, Transition GPS, to better prepare servicemembers to enter the civilian workforce – providing different tracks for those who want to go to college, those who want skills training, and those who want to be entrepreneurs.  And we’ve put a renewed focus on military ethics and professionalism, as well as making sure our military health system is held to the same high-quality standards we expect from the servicemembers and military family members under its care. Because we know how important it is – both for today’s servicemembers and the generation that will follow them – we’re also deeply committed to creating an environment and culture where we live the values we defend and every servicemember is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. That’s why we’re continuing to expand combat positions available to women – because everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country should have full and equal opportunity to do so. It’s why we’re striving to eliminate sexual assault from the military. And it’s why we’ve been making sure gay and lesbian servicemembers can serve openly, and that their families receive the benefits their loved ones have earned. But for everything we’re doing, DoD cannot build the force of the future by ourselves.  We need Congress’s help. What We Need Congress To Do Since our current defense budget drawdown began several years ago, I’ve observed something of a phenomenon here in Washington. Along with our troops, their families, and our defense civilians, I thank our supporters on Capitol Hill, including most members of this committee, who have joined with us in trying to do everything possible to get Congress to prevent more mindless cuts to our defense budget. Unfortunately, these combined efforts have been unsuccessful in actually restoring adequate and predictable resources for DoD.  We have had to endure deep cuts to readiness, weather pay freezes and civilian furloughs, and cut badly needed investments in modernization and critical technologies.  At the same time, Congress has sometimes sought to protect programs that DoD has argued are no longer needed, or require significant reform. We have had the worst of both worlds – a double whammy of mindless sequestration coupled with inability to reform. As many of you know, it wasn’t always this way. During the defense drawdown after the Cold War, DoD had much more flexibility thanks to the help of Congress.  For example, we were able to resize the Army, retire the A-6 Intruder and many other weapons systems, and implement multiple BRAC rounds, which freed up dollars we re-allocated to keep our force structure ready, capable, and deployable around the world. I know some of the changes and reforms we’re proposing may feel like a significant change from how we currently do business.  But if anyone can understand how the dots connect and how we need Congress’s help to be able to defend our country, our allies, and our interests in an increasingly dangerous world, it’s you – the members of this committee. The fact is, if we’re not able to implement the changes and reforms we need, we will be forced to make painful tradeoffs, even at the higher topline the President is requesting.  We will lose further ground on modernization and readiness – leaving tomorrow’s force less capable and leaving our nation less secure.  And we will face significant hurdles to executing our nation’s defense strategy.  That’s why we need your help.  III. THE PRESIDENT’S FISCAL YEAR 2016 BUDGET As we do every year when formulating our budget, this budget seeks to balance readiness, capability, and size – because we must ensure that, whatever the size of our force, we have the resources to provide every servicemember with the right training, the right equipment, the right compensation, and the right quality of fellow troops.  That is the only way we can ensure our military is fully prepared to accomplish its missions. Almost two-thirds of DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 base budget – $348.4 billion – funds our day-to-day expenses, similar to what a business would call its operating budget.  This covers, among other expenses, the cost of fuel, spare parts, logistics support, maintenance, service contracts, and administration.  It also includes pay and benefits for military and civilian personnel, which by themselves comprise nearly half of our total budget. The remaining third of our base budget – $185.9 billion – comprises investments in future defense needs, much like a business’ capital improvement budget.  It pays for the research, development, testing, evaluation, and ultimately acquisition of the weapons, equipment, and facilities that our servicemembers need. Broken down differently, our base budget includes the following categories:  Modernization What makes this budget different is the focus it puts, more so than any other over the last decade, on new funding for modernization.  After years of war, which required the deferral of longer-term modernization investments, this budget puts renewed emphasis on preparing for future threats – especially threats that challenge our military’s power projection capabilities. Threats to Power Projection and our Technological Edge Being able to project power anywhere across the globe by rapidly surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies lies at the core of our defense strategy and what the American people have come to expect of their military.  It guarantees that when an acute crisis erupts anywhere in the world, America can provide aid when disaster strikes, reinforce our allies when they are threatened, and protect our citizens and interests globally.  It also assures freedom of navigation and overflight, and allows global commerce to flow freely. For decades, U.S. global power projection has relied on the ships, planes, submarines, bases, aircraft carriers, satellites, networks, and other advanced capabilities that comprise our military’s unrivaled technological edge.  But today that superiority is being challenged in unprecedented ways. Advanced military technologies, from rockets and drones to chemical and biological capabilities, have found their way into the arsenals of both non-state actors as well as previously less capable militaries.  And other nations – among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea – have been pursuing long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap that has long existed between them and the United States. These modernization programs are developing and fielding advanced aircraft, submarines, and both longer-range and more accurate ballistic and cruise missiles.  They’re developing new and advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles, as well as new counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities.  In some areas, we see levels of new weapons development that we haven’t seen since the mid-1980s, near the peak of the Soviet Union’s surge in Cold War defense spending. Targeted Investments in the President’s Budget One of the reasons we are asking for more money this year than last year is to reverse recent under-investment in new weapons systems by making targeted investments to help us stay ahead of emerging threats – adding substantial funding for space control and launch capabilities, missile defense, cyber, and advanced sensors, communications, and munitions – all of which are critical for power projection in contested environments. The budget also makes significant investments in the resilience and survivability of our infrastructure and forces, particularly in the western Pacific, with improved active defenses such as our Patriot and AEGIS systems, as well as selective hardening of key installations and facilities. DoD is also addressing the erosion of U.S. technological superiority with the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII).  The DII is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century. The DII will identify, develop, and field breakthrough technologies and systems through a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program, and the President’s budget supports this effort through specific investments in promising new technologies and capabilities such as high-speed strike weapons, advanced aeronautics, rail guns, and high energy lasers.  The DII also involves the development of innovative operational concepts that would help us use our current capabilities in new and creative ways.  The ultimate aim is to help craft ‘offset strategies’ that maximize our strengths and exploit the weaknesses of potential adversaries. Our budget is also making focused and sustained investments in modernization and manning across the nuclear enterprise, even as we reduce the roles and numbers of nuclear weapons in the U.S. nuclear posture.  These investments are critical for ensuring the continued safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, as well as the long-term health of the force that supports our nuclear triad, particularly after recent troubling lapses in parts of DoD’s nuclear enterprise.  To help fund improvements across the nuclear enterprise, we are requesting an increase of approximately $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016, and about $8 billion over the FYDP. Readiness DoD must rebuild and recover after more than 13 years of uninterrupted war.  But our effort to do so has been frustrated by two variables, both of which are out of our hands – one, the continued high operational tempo and high demand for our forces, and two, the uncertainty surrounding annual appropriations. Only over the last couple of years has readiness begun to recover from the strains of over a decade of war, exacerbated by sequestration in 2013.  Nevertheless, readiness remains at troubling levels across the force. While our forward-deployed forces remain ready, our surge forces at home are not as ready as they need to be.  The President’s budget therefore invests in near-term unit readiness by adjusting service end-strength ramps to reduce personnel turbulence and stress on the force, while increasing funding to improve home station training and training-related infrastructure. This past year has demonstrated that our military must be ready to fight more than just the last war.  We have to be prepared across all domains – air, land, sea, space, and in cyberspace – to engage in both low- and high-end missions and conflicts, as well as in the shadowy, so-called ‘hybrid warfare’ space in between. While this budget submission’s requested and projected funding levels will enable the military to continue making steady progress toward full-spectrum combat readiness, the gains we’ve recently made are fragile.  Sustaining them to provide for ready and capable forces will require both time and a stable flow of resources, which is why, even under the budget we’re requesting, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps won’t all reach their readiness goals until 2020, and the Air Force won’t do so until 2023. Army: For Fiscal Year 2016, the Army’s base budget of $126.5 billion supports an end-strength of 1,015,000 soldiers – 475,000 soldiers on active duty, 342,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 198,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 57 total force brigade combat teams and associated enablers.  The budget also supports 19 brigade-level training rotations at the Army’s Combat Training Centers, which are critical to the Army’s efforts to reach full-spectrum combat readiness. While the Army’s postwar end-strength target remains a force of approximately 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 Army National Guard soldiers and 195,000 Army Reserve soldiers, this year’s budget slows the drawdown rate.  Rather than planning to reduce the active-duty force by 20,000 soldiers and the National Guard by 14,000 soldiers in Fiscal Year 2016, the Army will instead plan to reduce by 15,000 active-duty soldiers and 8,000 Guardsmen, while still maintaining its schedule for reducing unit structure.  This will help mitigate personnel turbulence and stress, while also improving unit manning as the Army approaches its target size. The Army’s budget for Fiscal Year 2016 also includes $4.5 billion for Army helicopter modernization.  Specifically:  These investments require difficult trade-offs given today’s constrained fiscal environment.  That is why the Army is resubmitting the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative, which makes the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars by retiring outdated airframes and streamlining the Army’s helicopter fleet so that platforms can be modernized and allocated where they are needed most. As you know, I am committed to reviewing the Army’s Aviation Restructure Initiative.  However, the Army believes that fully implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which includes shifting National Guard Apaches to active-duty units while providing Guard units with Black Hawks, is prudent for several reasons. For one, Apaches are in high demand at high levels of readiness that would require Guard units manning them to mobilize at unprecedentedly high rates; or alternatively, for the Army to spend a total of approximately $4.4 billion to fully equip the Guard’s Apache battalions, and then $350 million per year to maintain them at those high levels of readiness.  Meanwhile, Black Hawks are more suitable for Guard missions here at home.  Whether homeland defense, disaster relief, support to civil authorities, or complementing our active-duty military, these missions tend to demand transport and medical capabilities more than the attack capabilities of Apaches.  In sum, the initiative avoids approximately $12 billion in costs through Fiscal Year 2035 and saves over $1 billion annually starting in Fiscal Year 2020.  Considering these figures, implementing the Aviation Restructure Initiative is not only in the best warfighting interest of the Army, but also in the interest of the taxpayers who fund it. I know this is a contentious issue.  However, we believe the ARI is the least cost, best solution for the Army’s aviation enterprise.  DoD looks forward to making its case to the National Commission on the Future of the Army established by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Navy & Marine Corps: The Navy and Marine Corps are allocated $161 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a 282-ship fleet in 2016 and a 304-ship fleet by Fiscal Year 2020 with a return to 11 aircraft carriers, 386,600 active-duty and Reserve sailors, and 222,900 active-duty and Reserve Marines. The President’s budget invests $16.6 billion in shipbuilding for Fiscal Year 2016, and $95.9 billion over the FYDP.  The budget protects critical Navy and Marine Corps investments in undersea, surface, amphibious, and airborne capabilities – all of which are critical for addressing emerging threats.  Specifically:  Making these investments while also abiding by fiscal prudence, we had to make more difficult trade-offs.  For that reason, we are resubmitting our request to place some of the Navy’s cruisers and an amphibious landing ship – 12 ships in total, including 11 cruisers – into a phased modernization program that will provide them with enhanced capability and a longer lifespan.  Given that our cruisers are the most capable ships for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and in light of anti-ship missile capabilities being pursued by other nations, this modernization program will, over the next decade and a half, be a baseline requirement for sustaining both our cruiser fleet and 11 carrier strike groups through 2045. I acknowledge and appreciate the plan put forward in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which helps us get to our goal, and which we have begun to implement.  However, this plan is more expensive, and results in shorter ship life.  Considering that our plan is critical for our power projection capabilities, we believe it should be implemented in full, and look forward to working with the Congress as we move forward. Air Force: The Air Force is allocated a base budget of $152.9 billion for Fiscal Year 2016, supporting a force of 491,700 active-duty, Guard, and Reserve airmen, 49 tactical fighter squadrons, 96 operational bombers out of a total 154-aircraft bomber fleet, and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that includes 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Air Force’s budget reflects DoD’s decision to protect modernization funding for advanced capabilities and platforms most relevant to both present and emerging threats – in this case, fifth-generation fighters, long-range bombers, and mid-air refueling aircraft to assure our air superiority and global reach; both manned and remotely-piloted aircraft to help meet Combatant Commanders’ needs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and research and development to ensure continued and competitive space launch capabilities.  Specifically:  In light of high demand coupled with Congressional consultations, the Air Force budget reflects DoD’s decision to slow the retirement timelines for three key ISR and battle management platforms. We chose to defer the retirement of the U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft until Fiscal Year 2019, when planned sensor upgrades to the RQ-4 Global Hawk will combine with other capabilities to mitigate the loss of the U-2.  We chose to delay the previously planned retirement of seven E-3 Sentry AWACS until Fiscal Year 2019, so they can support air operations over Iraq and Syria.  And we chose to delay retirement of any E-8 JSTARS through Fiscal Year 2020, pending final approval of the Air Force’s acquisition strategy for its replacement. The Air Force budget also supports a timeline that would phase out and retire the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2019.  With the gradual retirement of the A-10 that we’re proposing, the Air Force will better support legacy fleet readiness and the planned schedule for standing up the F-35A by filling in some of the overall fighter maintenance personnel shortfalls with trained and qualified personnel from the retiring A-10 squadrons. As you know, F-35 maintainer demand has already required the Air Force to use the authority Congress provided last year to move some A-10s into back-up aircraft inventory status.  I should note that the Air Force is doing so only to the extent that it absolutely must, and so far intends to move far fewer A-10s into this status than what Congress has authorized.  I know this is an important issue, and DoD looks forward to working with you on it. Defense-Wide: The remaining share of our base budget – about $94 billion – is allocated across the Department of Defense.  This includes funding for cyber, U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Health Agency, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and missile defense. For Fiscal Year 2016, a $9.6 billion total investment in missile defense helps protect the U.S. homeland, deployed forces, and our allies and partners.  This includes $8.1 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, $1.6 billion of which will help ensure the reliability of U.S. ground-based interceptors, which are currently sited at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  The budget also continues to support the President’s timeline for implementing the European Phased Adaptive Approach. Overseas Contingency Operations: Separate from DoD’s base budget, we are also requesting $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Fiscal Year 2016.  This represents a 21 percent decrease from last year’s $64.2 billion in OCO funding, continuing OCO’s decline since 2010, while also reflecting continued operational demands on U.S. forces around the world.  OCO comprises funding for:  The conclusion of major combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has resulted in a 73 percent drop in DoD’s OCO costs from their $187-billion peak in Fiscal Year 2008. We are continuing to use OCO as appropriate to finance our military’s response to unforeseen crises, but we must also account for those enduring priorities that we do not envision going away – such as supporting our Afghan partners, countering terrorism, maintaining a strong forward presence in the Middle East, and ensuring our military is ready to respond to a wide range of potential crises. The Administration intends to transition OCO’s enduring costs to the base budget between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2020.  We will do this over time, and in a way that protects our defense strategy – including DoD’s abilities to deter aggression, maintain crisis-ready forces, and project power across the globe.  This transition, however, will not be possible unless the threat of sequestration has been removed. Having financed the costs of key military activities – such as counterterrorism operations and our Middle East posture – outside the base budget for 14 years, and knowing that the security situation in the Middle East remains volatile, it will take time to determine which OCO costs are most likely to be enduring, and which are not.  But we will release a plan later this year, which will also address how we will budget for uncertainty surrounding unforeseen future crises, and implications for DoD’s budget.  IV. COMPENSATION The choices we face about military compensation are vexing, critically important, and closely followed, so I want to be direct and upfront with you. When our troops go into battle – risking their lives – we owe to them, and their families, not only adequate pay and compensation, but also the right investments – in the right people, the right training, and the right weapons and equipment – so that they can accomplish their missions and come home safely. To meet all of these obligations at once, we have to balance how we allocate our dollars.  It would be irresponsible to prioritize compensation, force size, equipment, or training in isolation, only to put our servicemembers’ lives at unacceptable risk in battle. For the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget, the Defense Department considered its compensation proposals very carefully, as well as those approved by Congress in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.  Accordingly, this budget again proposes modest adjustments to shift funds from compensation into readiness, capability, and force structure, so that our people can continue executing their missions with continued excellence. As you know, the Congressionally-commissioned Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission has recently released its own compensation proposals.  Their work, which DoD is continuing to analyze, shows thoughtfulness and good intent, which we deeply appreciate. Given that this hearing is being held before the department has submitted its recommendations on the commission’s report to President Obama, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss them at this time.  Many of these proposals would significantly affect our servicemembers and their families, and DoD owes them, the President, and the country our utmost diligence and most rigorous analysis. However, I can say that the department agrees with the overarching goals of the commission, especially providing servicemembers and beneficiaries more options – whether in preparing for retirement or in making health care choices. I can also say that the commission’s proposals are complicated, and do not lend themselves to binary answers.  Therefore, when we provide the President with our recommendations on each proposal, DoD will clarify not simply whether we support each proposal, but also where we recommend specific modifications to improve or enable us to fully support a given proposal. We believe there is something positive in almost every one of the commission’s recommendations, and that they present a great opportunity to ensure we honor our servicemembers past, present, and future.  I look forward to Congress’s support and partnership as we work hard to take advantage of it.  V. IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION At the end of 2013, policymakers came together on a bipartisan basis to partially reverse sequestration and pay for higher discretionary funding levels with long-term reforms.  We’ve seen how that bipartisan agreement has allowed us to invest in areas ranging from research and manufacturing to strengthening our military.  We’ve also seen the positive impact on our economy, with a more responsible and orderly budget process helping contribute to the fastest job growth since the late 1990s. The President’s budget builds on this progress by reversing sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closures, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy.  The President has also made clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. As the Joint Chiefs and others have outlined, and as I will detail in this testimony, sequestration would damage our national security, ultimately resulting in a military that is too small and insufficiently equipped to fully implement our defense strategy.  This would reflect poorly on America’s global leadership, which has been the one critical but defining constant in a turbulent and dangerous world.  In fact, even the threat of sequestration has had real effects. You don’t need me to tell you that the President has said he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security.  Why?  Because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military depends on a strong educational system, thriving private-sector businesses, and innovative research.  And because that principle – matching defense increases with non-defense increases dollar-for-dollar – was a basic condition of the bipartisan agreement we got in 2013.  The President sees no reason why we shouldn’t uphold those same principles in any agreement now. The only way we’re going to get out of the wilderness of sequestration is if we work together.  I therefore appeal to members of Congress, from both parties, to start looking for ways to find a truly bipartisan compromise.  I hope they can make clear to their colleagues that sequestration would also damage America’s long-term strength, preventing our country from making pro-growth investments in areas ranging from basic research to early childhood education – investments that, in the past, have helped make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Sequestration is set to return in just under 200 days.  Letting that happen would be unwise and unsafe for our national defense, over both the short and long term. Short-Term Impact DoD has had to live with uncertain budgets for the last three years, continuous and sudden downward revisions of our budget plans, and even a government closure.  To continue meeting all of our mission requirements, we’ve done our best to manage through these circumstances, underfunding significant parts of our force and its support systems.  Put bluntly, we have survived, but not thrived.  Our military has made painful choices and tradeoffs among the size, capabilities, and readiness of our joint force, and we’ve amassed a number of bills that are now coming due. That’s why the department has been counting on and planning for a budget increase of roughly $35 billion above sequestration-level caps in Fiscal Year 2016.  If it looks like DoD will be operating at sequestration levels in 2016, on October 1 we will have to swiftly begin making cuts so that we don’t end up $35 billion short as we approach year’s end. A return to sequestration in Fiscal Year 2016 would affect all aspects of the department, but not all equally. More than one-third of the Fiscal Year 2016 cuts would come have to come from Operations and Maintenance accounts, with unavoidable reductions in readiness and our ability to shape world events in America’s interest.  Let me put this more plainly:  allowing sequestration to return would deprive our troops of what they need to accomplish their missions. Approximately half of the cuts would have to come from the department’s modernization accounts, undermining our efforts to secure technological superiority for U.S. forces in future conflicts.  Because there are bills that DoD absolutely must pay – such as the salaries of our troops – many capabilities being developed to counter known threats from highly capable adversaries would be delayed or cancelled, deepening our nation’s vulnerabilities at a time when the world is growing more dangerous, not less.  Sequestration would put a hold on critical programs like our Aerospace Innovation Initiative, the Next Generation Adaptive Engine, the Ground-Based Interceptor missile defense kill vehicle redesign, and several space control efforts. Deferring these investments is bad policy and makes the Defense Department less competitive for the future.  What’s more, it breaks faith with the troops of today and the troops of tomorrow.  And it undermines the defense industrial base that is a critical foundation for our national security. Long-Term Impact If sequestration were to persist over time, the long-term consequences would be harder hitting.  We would ultimately have a military that looks fundamentally different, and that performs much differently, from what our nation is accustomed to. If we are forced to sequestration-level budgets, I do not believe that we can continue to make incremental cuts and maintain the same general set of objectives as we’ve had in our defense strategy.  I will insist that new cuts be accompanied by a frank reassessment of our strategic approach to addressing the threats we face around the world – what we are asking the Armed Forces to do and to be prepared to do. I cannot tell you right now exactly what that means – DoD is not resigned to the return of sequestration – but I can tell you that I will direct the department to look at all aspects of the defense budget to determine how best to absorb these cuts.  No portion of our budget can remain inviolate. What I will not do is let DoD continue mortgaging our future readiness and capability.  I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, and ineffective doctrine. Everything else is on the table. What does that mean?  We could be forced to consider pay cuts, not just cuts in the growth of compensation.  We could be forced to consider all means of shedding excess infrastructure, not just working within the Congressional BRAC process.  We could be forced to look at significant force structure cuts, not just trimming around the edges.  We could be forced to ask our military to do – and be prepared to do – significantly less than what we have traditionally expected, and required of it. I am not afraid to ask these difficult questions, but if we are stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. A prolonged period of depressed defense budgets will almost certainly mean a smaller, less capable, and less ready military.  No one can fully predict the impact on the future.  But it could translate into future conflicts that last longer, and are more costly in both lives and dollars. That may sound severe to some, but it is a fact, and history should be our guide when we think about the true cost of sequestration. The Case for Repealing Sequestration I know I’m preaching to the choir here.  If sequestration could have been reversed by just this committee and its counterpart in the Senate, it probably would have happened years ago.  So I offer the following to Members of the Committee about what you can remind your colleagues when you ask for their vote to repeal sequestration: Remind them that even after the increase we’re asking for, DoD’s budget as a share of total federal spending will still be at a near-historic low – a quarter of what it was during the Korean War, a third of what it was during the Vietnam War, and half of what it was during the Reagan buildup. Remind them that the increased funding is for modernization that’s critical to keeping our military’s technological edge and staying ahead of potential adversaries. Remind them that DoD has hands-on leadership from the very top – me – devoted to using taxpayer dollars better than they’ve been used in the past.  You have my personal commitment to greater accountability, greater efficiency, and running this department better and leaner than before. Remind them that sequestration’s cuts to long-term investments will likely make those investments more costly down the line.  All who bemoan unnecessary Pentagon program delays and the associated cost overruns should know that sequestration will only make these problems worse.  I can easily sympathize with my non-defense counterparts in this regard; knowing how wasteful and inefficient sequestration would be at DoD, I have no doubt the same is true at other departments and agencies as well. Remind them that sequestration’s impact on our domestic budget will cause further long-term damage to our defense – because the strength of our nation depends on the strength of our economy, and a strong military needs strong schools to provide the best people, strong businesses to provide the best weapons and equipment, and strong science and research sectors to provide the best new innovations and technologies. Remind them that we can’t keep kicking this can down the road.  The more we prolong tough decisions, the more difficult and more costly they will be later on.  VI. CONCLUSION The men and women of the Department of Defense are counting on Congress to help assure the strength of our military and American global leadership at a time of great change in the world. We must reverse the decline in defense budgets to execute our strategy and fund a modern, ready, leaner force in a balanced way.  We must seize the opportunity to enact necessary reforms in how we do business.  And we must bring an end to the threat sequestration poses to the future of our force and American credibility around the world. As you evaluate the President’s budget submission, I encourage you and your colleagues to keep it in perspective. In the years since the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 budget request – the benchmark for cuts prescribed under the 2011 Budget Control Act – DoD’s 10-year budget projections have absorbed more than $750 billion in cuts, or more than three-quarters of the trillion-dollar cuts that would be required should sequestration be allowed to run its course.  And while some claim this is our biggest budget ever, the fact is, as a share of total federal spending, DoD’s Fiscal Year 2016 budget is at a near-historic low – representing about 14 percent of total federal discretionary and non-discretionary outlays.  DoD’s total budget remains more than $100 billion below what it was at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was even more complicated than we could have foreseen.  Given today’s security environment – which has over 200,000 American servicemembers stationed in over 130 countries conducting nearly 60 named operations – our proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is a responsible, prudent approach. Some of you may recall how, in 1991, after America’s Cold War victory and amid doubts about America’s engagement with the world and calls for a bigger domestic peace dividend, a bipartisan group in Congress stepped forward to help shape America’ global leadership and make long-term decisions from which we continue to benefit. Senators Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar helped craft, pass, and pay for the small Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that allowed the United States and DoD to provide the funding and expertise to help former Soviet states decommission their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon stockpiles. The Nunn-Lugar program was initially opposed abroad, and there were also doubts at the Pentagon about whether we could implement it without losing track of funding.  I know.  I helped lead the program in its early years.  But with slow and diligent effort by American defense officials, the Congress, and our foreign partners, it worked. It helped prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands.  It helped establish a pattern of international cooperation and global norms in the post-Cold War international order.  And, in the light of the current instability in Ukraine, it might have staved off several variants of nuclear disaster. But it also set an important precedent for our work on this budget and in the years ahead.  It shows what Congressional conviction – especially when it is bipartisan – can accomplish in foreign policy.  It shows the value of foresight and planning for an uncertain future.  And it shows how spending a relatively few dollars today can generate huge value down the line. As the new Secretary of Defense, I hope it will be possible to again unite behind what our great nation should do to protect our people and make a better world, and provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they deserve. Thank you.

"May 25, 2015","While every Memorial Day is marked with solemn remembrance, in 2015 we take special note.  This year – as we mark the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, the 65th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, the 40th anniversary of our departure from Vietnam, and the 25th anniversary of Operation Desert Shield in the lead-up to the Gulf War – we honor and remember those who perished in those wars, just as we recall the more than 6,800 American servicemembers who gave their lives since September 11, 2001. To the families of our fallen patriots:  we lack the words to describe what you feel on Memorial Day, because try as we may – as we must – we can never fully know it.  But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to our country, and to a world that still depends so much on America for its security. As our nation remembers the service and sacrifice of previous generations, we as a people recognize that the men and women serving in uniform today – active-duty, Guard, and Reserve – are as humble, patriotic, and selfless as any generation that has come before.  They, alongside their families, continue that tradition of service to country that makes our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Nearly 200,000 of these soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are currently serving beyond our shores, protecting us far from home, and will not be able to spend this holiday with their loved ones.  Today, and every day, we honor them and their families with our heartfelt thanks and support.

"Oct. 5, 2016","Well, good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to the Pentagon, and welcome to the very first public meeting of our new Defense Innovation Board. I want to begin by thanking the board’s chair, Eric Schmidt, for his leadership.  And I want to thank each of you – each of you, all the board members – for your willingness to serve our country in this capacity.  You represent some of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people.  And we’re very grateful that you’ve decided to be part of our mission here. As many of you have heard me say, one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to push the Pentagon to think outside this wonderful five-sided box, and be more open to new ideas and new partnerships that can help our military remain what it is today – the finest fighting force the world has ever known – as we confront a changing and fiercely competitive world.  And that’s exactly why I created the Defense Innovation Board earlier this year – to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive, stay ahead of our competitors, and stay the best, particularly by keeping DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, practices, organizations, and technology. There are several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise.  The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served, has a membership with strong foreign and defense policymaking experience.  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoD’s vast business expertise – I’m sorry, business enterprise – and practices.  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role.  Its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches to talent management, organizational practices and structure, technology, and global strategies that have worked in their leadership experience and that might be applicable to us. I could not have asked for a group better qualified for this mission.  I’m grateful to these citizen-leader-innovators for taking the time from their busy schedules to do this – I don’t take it for granted – and for your selfless willingness to contribute to the defense of our nation and making a better world for our children. And, because of its unique role, the Defense Innovation Board may not operate exactly like the other advisory boards we have here at DoD, and that’s okay.  After all, we have to be willing to do things a little bit differently if we’re going to succeed in this mission.  And I’m going to commend members of the Innovation Board for already taking several preparatory fact-finding trips to military bases across the country, to get to know different parts of our institution – including some very innovative places in their own right.  Indeed, so far board members have spent time with airmen at Nellis Air Force Base, with sailors aboard ships docked in San Diego, with soldiers and special operators at Fort Bragg, and DIB members also visited our Central Command and Special Operations Command  in Tampa, among other DoD installations. I understand that as a result of this initial fact-finding – and, of course, based on the knowledge and experience each of you brings to the table from your private-sector lives, both in industry and in the academy – members of the board will discuss today some preliminary observations and interim recommendations about certain innovative practices from outside DoD that might be useful to us inside. And I’m pleased that, rather than just going off and returning with a several hundred-page report, you’re here today to share these early findings with me and the public, and to solicit feedback as you begin your work. I know you have a busy day ahead of you, so I’ll close by asking you to think for a moment – all of us – to reflect upon everything that America’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are doing all around the world today as we sit here this morning. Right now – as we sit here in this room – our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our world-wide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate ISIL’s certain and lasting defeat – we saw that in Ramadi, in Hit, in Rutbah, in Qayyarah, in Makhmour, Shaddadi, and Manbij, and in the coming weeks, as we approach Mosul, Raqqa, Dabiq, and we’ll crush the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based upon ISIL’s ideology.   They’re also standing with our NATO allies, in Europe, and standing up to Russian aggression in Europe.  They’re also sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive security network – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future, the Asia-Pacific, remains stable, secure, and prosperous, so that all nations there can continue to rise and prosper.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula – every day, every night – enhancing our deterrence and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And all the while, they’re helping to protect our homeland.  And they’re preparing us to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today.  All that. They know, as you know, that contributing to this mission – helping to defend this great country and make a better world – is one of the noblest things a person can do with their life.  Now you have a chance to make your own contribution to that mission, and help us accomplish it.  And you can help us create excitement about the importance of our mission, and perhaps attract some more talented young Americans to serve our country – in uniform, as civilians, or in industry. So on behalf of our country and our military, I appreciate your choosing to do so – from each and every one of you.  And I look forward to seeing more of you, and hearing your final recommendations. Thank you.

"Oct. 17, 2014","Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, leaders of our defense enterprise, Deputy Secretary Work, Chairman Dempsey, and all who lead the men and women of our armed forces, we thank you all, we thank you all for being here this morning to thank our friend and former Commandant Jim Amos for more than four decades of service to our nation and to welcome the new Commandant of our United States Marine Corps, General Joe Dunford. But first, allow me to thank the Amos family. Bonnie, you have been an extraordinary role model.  You’ve been a dedicated partner throughout Jim’s long and distinguished career.  Over forty-four years, you have managed twenty-nine relocations and twenty-five different schools for your children if you count.  You have been a tireless advocate for our Marine families.  And thank you for all the encouragement, the support, the love, and, I know, very wise advice you have given General Amos over many years.  And thank you for your service to the Corps, and to our nation. As you all know, in addition to being a husband, father, and grandfather, Jim has a long record of leadership and many, many impressive accomplishments.  He helped make peace – and keep it – in the Balkans.  He commanded Marine aviation in Iraq.  He served in important positions of responsibility at NATO and the Pentagon. But perhaps above all else, General Amos is a distinguished Marine fighter pilot.  As Commandant, Jim brought a Marine aviator’s focus, discipline, and creativity to the challenges facing the Corps at this unique time in our history. His tenure as Commandant came not only at a time of war, and defining transitions, but also at a time of great uncertainty…and wrenching challenges for our military budget. Through it all, General Amos never forgot the men and women under his command.  Ensuring they were trained and equipped, and ready.  And making sure his Marines were always taken care of. Jim made countless trips to Helmand, in Afghanistan, to visit with Marines and all our soldiers, and ensure they had what they needed to win.  He helped ensure that the Marine Corps led the way in the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.  Under Jim’s leadership, the Marines established an innovative rotational presence in Australia, and have helped strengthen our partnerships and alliances all over [the] Asia-Pacific. After more than 13 years of grinding warfare, General Amos has also helped the Marines revitalize their amphibious and expeditionary roles.  From North Africa to the Middle East, when crisis strikes, the Marines are first responders…because General Amos made readiness and the health of the force his highest priority, ensuring that Marines meet their mission with the right tools at the right time…and with the highest standards of integrity and discipline. While upholding the Corps’ storied traditions, General Amos has also helped the Marines navigate important changes…successfully implementing the repeal of don’t-ask-don’t tell, and integrating women into combat arms. General Amos has said, “Change doesn't come easy to the Marine Corps, but…when it is rooted, it lasts forever.""  Jim’s lasting legacy will be his effort to ensure that the Marine Corps’ new traditions are firmly rooted, leaving behind a Corps stronger than ever before. Because membership in the Corps never expires, never dies, Jim has made it his mission to rid the American lexicon of the term, that dreaded “former Marine.”  And he didn’t just state that as his personal preference: he made it a policy.  No matter where you are or what you are doing, Jim has said, ""You're a Marine” – just in a different uniform and in a different phase of your life.  All of us here know that Jim, always a Marine, will continue to serve the Corps, and our nation, with the highest distinction…as he transitions to his own different uniform, and his own different phase of life with Bonnie. As we thank Jim Amos and recognize his successful leadership through a time of enormous change, we can be very confident that General Joe Dunford will build on Jim’s leadership and make the United States Marine Corps even stronger. Like General Amos, General Dunford has had a storied career.  He is a highly respected, battle-tested infantry officer.  Over the last two years, his steady leadership, his wise leadership of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan has successfully kept our transition in Afghanistan on track and on focus despite unrelenting challenges. I’ve gotten to know Joe very well over the past 20 months.  I’ve come to rely on his wise judgment.  The President of the United States trusts his judgment.  And I look forward to working closely with him as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 36th Commandant of the Marine Corps.  He is superbly qualified and prepared to help write the next chapter of the United States Marine Corps’ history.  And to Ellyn, we welcome you back and thank you for all of your sacrifices over many years, and your family. Joe and Ellyn, we are grateful to you and your family for your service and commitment to this nation. Jim and Bonnie, we will miss you.  We will miss you greatly. To all four of you: On behalf of President Obama and the American people, Lilibet and I wish you all the best as you begin this new phase, this exciting, wonderful, new phase that you’ve earned in your lives.  And once again, thank you for all you have done for the Marine Corps, the Department of Defense, the United States of America, and all of us who’ve had the great privilege of serving with you, General Amos. May God continue to bless our Marines, all who serve, and our great nation.  Thank you all very much.

"Sept. 18, 2014","Chairman McKeon, Ranking Member Smith, members of the committee, I very much appreciate the opportunity this morning to discuss the President's strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.

	Mr. Chairman, on a personal note, I want to thank you for your leadership on yesterday's vote. I believe, the President believes the vote was a very important and defining vote, and we are not unmindful of the work that you and others on this committee invested in that vote and getting a turnout, but you did.  So thank you.

	Yesterday, I joined President Obama at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, where he received a briefing from the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Austin, on operational plans to implement our ISIL strategy and met with representatives, while I was there, as did the President, from more than 40 partner nations.

	I'm joined here today, as you have noted, Mr. Chairman, by the Joint Staff's Director for Operations, Lieutenant General Bill Mayville.  He is our “J-3,” and General Mayville helps oversee, among many of his responsibilities, our military operations in Iraq, the Middle East and in CENTCOM and works closely with General Austin in CENTCOM to develop all of our military plans.  So I appreciate very much General Mayville being here.

	And as you noted, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Dempsey is with our partners internationally over the next few days, and as you noted, he should be.  Much of that discussion will be about the Middle East, specifically Iraq and Syria.  He consults with our allies in this fight against ISIL and tomorrow, will attend a special NATO Chiefs of Defense conference in Lithuania, where they will be focused on the ISIL challenge.

	The Defense Department civilian and military leaders, Mr. Chairman, are in complete agreement with every component of the President's strategy, and we strongly believe it offers the best opportunity to degrade and destroy ISIL.  The President, Chairman Dempsey, General Austin and I are in full alignment on all of our objectives and our tactics and our strategy, that military strategy necessary to achieve the President's objective. However, as President Obama has repeatedly made clear, American military power alone cannot eradicate the threats posed by ISIL to the United States, our allies and our friends and partners in the region.  Iraq's continued political progress toward a more inclusive and representative government will be critical to achieving our objective.  We believe that Iraq's new Prime Minister is committed to bringing all Iraqis together against ISIL.  To support him and the Iraqi people in their fight against ISIL, against terrorists the special coalition that we are assembling will need to use all of its instruments of power -- military, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic and intelligence -- in coordination with the countries in the region.

	To succeed, this strategy will also require a strong partnership between the executive branch and Congress.  The President has made it a priority to consult with congressional leadership on the ISIL challenge, as have Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry and many senior members of the administration.  I appreciate the opportunities I've had to discuss our strategy with members of this committee, including you, Mr. Chairman, and other members of the Senate and the House over the last couple of weeks, and we'll continue with these consultations.

	ISIL poses a real threat to all countries in the Middle East, our European allies and to America, as you have noted, Mr. Chairman, as has Congressman Smith. In the last few months, the world has seen ISIL's barbarity up close as its fighters advanced across western and northern Iraq and slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians, including Sunni and Shia Muslims and Kurdish Iraqis and all religious minorities who stood in their way.  ISIL's murder of two U.S. journalists outraged the American people and exposed the depravity of ISIL's ideology and tactics, exposed those tactics and that brutal ideology to the world.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL's murder of a British citizen.  ISIL now controls a vast swathe of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq, including towns and cities in these areas.

	ISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  As it has seized territory across both countries and acquired significant resources and advanced weapons, ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.  ISIL has also been very adept at employing technology and social media, employing this to increase its global profile and attract tens of thousands of fighters. Its goal is to become the new vanguard of the global extremist movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden's legacy. While ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American citizens in Iraq and our interests in the Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including Europeans and more than 100 Americans, have traveled to Syria with passports that give them relative freedom of movement these fighters can exploit ISIL's safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.

	Although the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the U.S. homeland, ISIL has global aspirations -- clearly has global aspirations.  And they have so stated.  And, as President Obama has made clear, ISIL's leaders have threatened America and our allies.  If left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies.

	In his address to the nation last week, President Obama announced that the United States will lead a broad multinational coalition to roll back ISIL's threat and defeat ISIL. More than 40 nations have already expressed their willingness to participate in this effort, and more than 30 nations have indicated their readiness to offer military support.  President Obama and Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry and I and others are working to unite and expand this coalition.  At the NATO summit in Wales, Secretary Kerry and I convened a meeting of key partners in this coalition.  I then went to Georgia and Turkey, as you noted, Mr. Chairman.  The Georgians made clear they will help. Turkey, by virtue of its geography and its common interest in destroying ISIL -- and I might note an indispensable member of NATO, from the beginning of NATO, we know that Turkey is now in the grips of ISIL holding nearly 50 of its diplomats… As I was noting, ISIL is currently holding nearly 50 Turkish diplomats hostage.  And this obviously is a high and first priority of the Turkish government, to get those hostages back.  And in my conversations with President Erdoğan and other leaders in Turkey, we talked specifically about that, but also the important role Turkey will play in our overall efforts in this coalition.

	Secretary Kerry convened a meeting in Jeddah last week with foreign ministers from the six Gulf [Cooperation] Council states, also Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.

	And all 22 nations of the Arab League adopted a resolution at their summit in Cairo calling for comprehensive measures to combat ISIL.  Earlier this week in Paris, President Hollande of France, who traveled to Iraq last weekend, hosted a conference attended by the U.N. Security Council permanent members, European and Arab leaders, and representatives of the E.U., Arab League and United Nations.  They all pledged to help Iraq in the fight against ISIL including through military assistance.

	Other key allies, such as Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom are already contributing military support.  And other partners have begun to make specific offers.  At next week's U.N. General Assembly, we expect that additional nations will be making commitments across a spectrum of capabilities, building on the strong Chapter VII U.N. Security Council resolution adopted last month calling on all member states to take measures to counter ISIL and to suppress the flow of foreign fighters to ISIL.  Also next week President Obama will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to further mobilize the international community. As you all know, former International Security Assistance Force commander and acting CENTCOM commander, General John Allen, has been designated serve as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.  General Allen will work in a civilian diplomatic capacity to coordinate, build and sustain the coalition, drawing on his extensive experience in the Middle East. He will work closely with General Austin of CENTCOM to ensure that coalition efforts are aligned across all elements of our strategy. In his address to the nation, the President outlined the four elements of this strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.  Let me now describe how we are implementing this whole-of-government approach.

	First, in close coordination with the new Iraqi government, we are broadening our air campaign against ISIL targets to protect Americans threatened by ISIL and advances that ISIL is making, and also to prevent humanitarian catastrophe, the U.S. military has already conducted more than 170 successful airstrikes. These strikes have disrupted ISIL tactically and helped buy time for the Iraqi government to form an inclusive and broad-based governing coalition led by the new Prime Minister.  That was one of President Obama's essential preconditions for taking further action against ISIL, because the Iraqi people, the Iraqi people, must be united in their opposition to ISIL in order to defeat them.  This is ultimately their fight.

	The new broader air campaign against ISIL targets will enable Iraqi security forces including Kurdish forces to continue to stay on the offensive and recapture territory from ISIL and hold it. The President of the United States has the constitutional and the statutory authority to use military force against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq. Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi/Syrian border and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a border that exists in name only.

	CENTCOM's plan includes targeted actions against ISIL safe havens in Syria, including its command-and-control, logistics capabilities and infrastructure.  General Dempsey and I have both approved and spent considerable time reviewing and adapting the CENTCOM plan which General Austin, as I noted, briefed to the President in Tampa yesterday.

	The second element of the strategy is to increase our support for forces fighting ISIL on the ground.  Not American forces, but forces, Iraqi forces, fighting on the ground. To support Iraqi and Kurdish forces, the President announced last week that we would deploy an additional 475 American troops to Iraq.

	Part of that number includes approximately 150 advisers and support personnel to supplement forces already in Iraq conducting assessments of the Iraqi security forces.  This assessment mission is now transitioning to an advise-and-assist mission with more than 15 teams embedding with Iraqi security forces at the headquarters level to provide strategic and operational advice and assistance.

	By the time all these forces arrive, there will be approximately 1,600 U.S. personnel in Iraq responding to the ISIL threat.  But, as the President reaffirmed yesterday in Tampa, American forces will not have a combat mission on the ground. Instead, these advisers will continue to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces, including the government's plans to stand up Iraqi National Guard units.  These units are to help Sunni communities defeat ISIL in their area.

	The best counterweights to ISIL are local forces and local citizens, the people.  As you know, in June, the President asked Congress for the necessary authority for DOD to train and equip moderate Syria opposition forces, and $500 million to fund this program.  And, again, we appreciate yesterday's House vote to amend the Continuing Resolution with language authorizing this train-and- equip program.

	Saudi Arabia will host the training program to this mission.  And the Saudis have offered funding and additional assistance with recruiting and vetting. The $500 million request the President made in June for this train-and-equip program reflects CENTCOM's estimate of the cost to train, equip and resupply more than 5,000 opposition forces over one year.  This is the beginning of a multi-year, scalable effort designed to eventually produce an even larger opposition force. The package of assistance that we initially provide would consist of small arms, vehicles and basic equipment like communications as well as tactical and more advanced training.  As these forces prove their effectiveness on the battlefield, we would be prepared to provide increasingly sophisticated types of assistance to the most trusted commanders and capable forces.  The goal is not to achieve numerical parity with ISIL, but to ensure that moderate Syrian forces are superior fighters trained by units.  Our goal is to undercut ISIL's recruitment and to enable the Syrian opposition to add to the pressure ISIL is already facing from the Iraqi security forces and the security forces of Kurdistan.  We want to force ISIL into a three-front battle against more capable local forces. A rigorous vetting process will be critical to the success of this program.  DOD will work closely with the State Department, the intelligence community and all of our international partners and in the region to screen and vet the forces we train and equip.  We will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons do not fall into the hands of radical elements of the opposition, ISIL, the Syrian regime or other extremist groups.  There will always be risks, Mr. Chairman.  There are risks in everything.  There are risks in action and there are risks in inaction.  But we believe the risk is justified, given the real threat ISIL poses to this country and to the region and to our allies and as necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria.

	As we pursue this program, the United States will continue to press for political resolution to the Syrian conflict.  Assad has lost all legitimacy to govern.  He has created the conditions that allowed ISIL and other terrorist groups to gain ground and terrorize and slaughter the Syrian population.  The United States will not coordinate or cooperate with the Assad regime. The third element of the President's strategy is an all- inclusive approach to preventing attacks from ISIL against the homeland of the United States and our allies.  In concert with our international partners, the United States will draw on intelligence, law enforcement, diplomatic and economic tools to cut off ISIL's funding, improve our intelligence, strengthen homeland defense and stem the flow of foreign fighters. The United States and our allies have been stepping up efforts to identify encounter threats emanating from Syria against our homelands.  This includes increased intelligence sharing, working with DOD's partners at the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and across the intelligence community our terrorist screening and analytical databases now have special threat cases linking together known actors and potential foreign fighters, making it easier and faster to update them regularly with new information.  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has directed enhanced screening at 25 overseas airports with direct flights to the United States, a step that the United Kingdom and other countries have already taken.

	The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have launched an initiative to partner with local communities to counter extremist recruiting, and the Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence is working closely with coalition partners to disrupt ISIL's financing and expose their financing activities.

	The final element of the President's strategy is to continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians displaced or threatened by ISIL. Alongside the government of Iraq, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, U.S. troops have already delivered life-saving and thousands of threatened Iraqi civilians on Mt. Sinjar in the Iraqi town of Amirli.

	Our total humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqis is now more than $186 million for fiscal year 2014. The United States is also the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance for the millions of Syrians affected by the civil war.  Since the start of the Syrian conflict, the United States has committed almost $3 billion in humanitarian assistance to those affected by this war.

	All four elements of this strategy require a significant commitment of resources on the part of the United States and our coalition partners. This effort will not be easy; this effort will not be brief; this effort will not be simple.  We are at war with ISIL, just as we are at war with Al Qaeda.  But destroying ISIL will require more than military efforts alone…it will require political progress in the region and effective partners on the ground in Iraq and in Syria.  And as President Obama said yesterday in Tampa, “we cannot do for the Iraqis what they must do for themselves… we can’t do it for them, but this is an effort that calls on America’s unique abilities – and responsibilities – to lead.”

	As the Congress and the administration work together, we know this effort will take time.  The President has outlined a clear, a comprehensive and a workable strategy to achieve our goals and protect our interests.  Mr. Chairman, members of this committee, thank you, thank you for your continued support, your partnership and what you do for our men and women in uniform who protect this country.

	Thank you. ","Statement on Iraq, Syria, and ISIL Before the House Armed Services Committee",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/605610/statement-on-iraq-syria-and-isil-before-the-house-armed-services-committee/
"Sept. 21, 2017","Welcome Minister Macierewicz. I’ll just tell you your officers and the members of your delegation are most welcome here in the Pentagon. It is good to see you again so soon after the NATO Defense Ministerial in June. Listening to our national anthems outside the Pentagon today, I’m reminded that Poland and the United States have a long shared history of military cooperation and understanding. Here in Washington we have statues of Polish Generals Pulaski and Kosciuszo. These officers came to our aid during the Revolutionary War when our upstart country sought independence. In more modern times, the Polish people demonstrated their strength of resolve when you fought on after Poland was occupied during World War Two. From cities and from the forests, your guerilla warriors resisted with grit and courage. Flying out of England and jumping paratroopers into Ardennes, Polish soldiers fought all through the war. But the victory achieved against the fascists was lost to Soviet occupation. But Poland never gave up. Your solidarity showed that the Polish people will never accept domination. And today you are a valued member of NATO, and Poland leads by example. An American-led NATO battlegroup with troops from the United Kingdom and Romania stands with the nation that came to our aid in 1776. So the work to protect freedom continues as we stand together against any threat from the east – two countries that are bound by democratic values and the NATO alliance. Our government here in Washington notes proudly that Poland continues to meet the Wales Pledge, leading by example. So today, we look forward to discussing how we can further strengthen our military relationship – strengthening both defense capabilities and NATO interoperability for the future. So Minister, members of the delegation, you are very welcome here. Thanks again for traveling here for these discussions. # # # ",Meeting with Polish Minister of National Defence Macierewicz,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1320224/meeting-with-polish-minister-of-national-defence-macierewicz/
"Sept. 16, 2014","Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today to honor two remarkable remarkable Americans who exhibited the highest valor during their service in Vietnam:  Command Sergeant Major Bennie Adkins, who is here today with his wife Mary, his children, and grandchildren; and Specialist Four Don Sloat, who lost his life fighting for our country, and who is represented today by his brother William, sisters Kathleen and Karen, and extended family. I welcome you all.  I’m very proud of you.  This whole country is very proud of you.  I think President Obama made that very clear yesterday in a very special recognition at the White House when you were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Doctor [Sloat ] your brother was awarded and you received on his behalf, so thank you and your family very much. I’d also like to welcome those of you here to acknowledge these two special Americans, also those who served in battle with these men.  We’re very proud of you, we’re grateful for your service, for what you have done for our country, and what you mean to all of us.  You witnessed first-hand courageous actions…certainly, the courageous actions of the two we honor today…but you too exhibited tremendous bravery on the battlefield. Last month marked 50 years since the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, and the escalation of the Vietnam War … a conflict that would affect the lives of millions of Americans – ending tens of thousands of lives of those Americans much too soon, leaving others with visible and invisible wounds of war, and leaving far too many selfless warriors without the dignity, the respect, and appreciation they deserved when they all came home. We still have not made things right for many of these Vietnam veterans. But today we have the opportunity to correct the record for two of them. Many of you are familiar with their stories of heroism, which again, the President described yesterday at the White House.  But they bear repeating. Over the 38 hours that his base camp was under fire, Sergeant Major Adkins repeatedly put himself in harm’s way to move his wounded comrades to safety, gather urgently needed supplies, and recover the fallen.  He almost single-handedly repelled enemy forces when they launched their main assault, firing all the ammunition left in the camp.  And when he missed the evacuation helicopter in an attempt to carry out a wounded solider, he led the survivors into the jungle and evaded capture for another two days. In doing so, Sergeant Major Adkins displayed a level of bravery that saved lives, and showed the enemy that American soldiers have the will to fight…they had the will to fight until the very last bullet.  As he said recently, recalling that experience with understated humility, “It was not my day to die.” While Sergeant Major Adkins’ ordeal spanned days and days, Specialist Sloat’s lasted one instant – but it was no less heroic.  A grenade rolled toward him, tripped by a fellow soldier while they were on patrol in the Que Son Valley.  Specialist Sloat had a split-second choice to make – and less than four months into his tour in Vietnam, and not even a year since enlisting in the Army – he made a selfless sacrifice to protect his brothers.  Said a rifleman on patrol with him that day, “I was only five to eight feet behind Don when the grenade went off … his act saved my life and the life of others.” That decision – to put the greater good above self, to sacrifice the one for the many – reflects the core values of our military.  At our best, we aspire to the altruism, the dedication, and the bold courage that Specialist Sloat embodied that day.  By honoring him and Sergeant Major Adkins on this day, we hope their stories will inspire a new generation of leaders. We honor these two soldiers for the remarkable valor they exhibited on the battlefield, for reminding us of the awesome power of the human spirit, and for symbolizing the fearless determination of the American soldier.  As President Kennedy once said, “A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces, but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.” May God bless these two soldiers, their families, and all the men and women in our Armed Forces who – day in and day out – personify the ideals of our great nation. Thank you very much.

"April 15, 2016","Thank you, General, for that warm introduction and also, I should say, your leadership.  And good morning, everyone. Today, at an exercise named Balikatan, or “shoulder-to-shoulder,” I am so honored to stand before you, row after row of Americans and Filipinos, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, at the close of the 32nd iteration of this important bilateral exercise.  Congratulations to you, and your leadership General Toolan, Admiral Lopez, on everything you’ve accomplished over the last two weeks. To our Filipino allies, thank you for your partnership.  Secretary Gazmin, Secretary Almendras, leaders and representatives of the Philippine Armed Forces and government, we appreciate your dedication to this exercise and to our alliance.  For 65 years, our two nations have been standing together, and America’s commitment to the Philippines remains ironclad. Balikatan is another demonstration of the long-standing and now rapidly growing network of security in the Asia-Pacific.  I would like to thank our Australian allies for their participation for a third year.  And  observer nation officials here today, including those from Japan and elsewhere, and others who attended over the course of the exercise, I am pleased to see so many nations interested in working together to promote stability and security in the Asia-Pacific. And to our American service members, thank you for your participation in this important exercise.  Thank you for your hard work in this consequential region and alongside our allies, like the Philippines.  And thank you for your dedication to the defense of our nation and the values that we, and many other nations around the region, hold dear. Although we are marking the successful conclusion of this multifaceted exercise, tragedy struck in the early days of Balikatan 2016 with the death of Philippine Airman 2nd Class Jover Dumansi.  And I want to express my condolences, on behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and all Americans, to Airman Dumansi’s family and friends, as well as to the Philippine Armed Forces, government, and people.  His loss is a reminder of the risks that each of you – and your families – accepts each day, just as the successful continuation of this exercise, in the face of such a tragedy, is a reminder of our shared commitment to always seeing the mission through. All of you, and the more than 7,000 personnel who joined you, have done just that here at Balikatan, and you’ve done so in exemplary fashion.  Together, you’ve provided medical care to local communities.  Together, you’ve improved our combined command and control.  Together, you’ve rehearsed maritime interdiction operations so we can respond more quickly to threats on the sea.  And, together, you’ve simulated the recovery of an oil and gas platform from hostile forces in the South China Sea. Through it all, you’ve made our strong alliance even stronger. You’ve helped prepare our nations and this important alliance to confront the very real challenges we face.  And you have demonstrated to the region and the world that the United States and the Philippines are standing together to defend the rules and principles that that have benefited so many in the region: rules and principles like the peaceful resolution of disputes, countries being able to make their own security and economic choices free from coercion and intimidation, and freedom of navigation and overflight. You’ve also set the stage for a new level of cooperation between the Philippines and the United States. With the success of Balikatan 2016 – and two major recent policy steps forward, the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and the new U.S. Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative – we are going to be doing more together.  And, as I announced yesterday, some Americans here for this exercise will be staying behind on a rotational basis to continue joint training and working with our Philippine allies to contribute to regional security and stability.  I thank these servicemembers for taking on these important assignments. You’ve also contributed to the Asia-Pacific’s ongoing stability and security. It is said of this region, that security is like oxygen.  When you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  But when you don’t have enough, you can think of nothing else.  Here in the Asia-Pacific, through exercises like Balikatan and real world operations, all of you, Americans and Filipinos, soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, provide that oxygen – the security that enables millions upon millions of people all around the Asia-Pacific to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full. Later today, I will visit the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, sailing in the South China Sea after – after, that is – after some of its sailors and Marines participated with you in Balikatan.  Just as this year’s is the 32nd Balikatan, extending back to the early 1980s, the Stennis has sailed in these waters many times before, and sailed, not just here in the South China Sea, but all around the vast Asia-Pacific six times in the last several years.  So far on this deployment, it has operated near the Republic of Korea, through the Sea of Japan, in Guam, and now in the South China Sea.  With each Balikatan and each cruise by the Stennis, with each new multilateral exercise and each new defense agreement, we add a stitch to the fabric of the region’s, region’s security network.  This is the network – peaceful, principled, and inclusive – America continues to stand for, and to stand with. At a time of change in this dynamic region, and democratic transitions in the Philippines and the United States, we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder.  And we will continue to stand up for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies, and for the values, principles, and rule-based order that has benefited so many for so long.  As long as we remain steadfast in that commitment, as we have for decades, we will continue to ensure the Philippines remains secure and the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper – for generations to come. Thank you. ",Remarks at Balikatan Closing Ceremony,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/722820/remarks-at-balikatan-closing-ceremony/
"Sept. 19, 2014","Admiral Winnefeld, thank you. And to our former POWs, families of former POWs, families our missing-in-action, we welcome you.  We honor you.  We thank you.  And we are grateful that you are here to share a special day of recognition with us, with our country. Yesterday afternoon, at Arlington National Cemetery, a soldier from the Korean War who for decades was listed as missing-in-action finally received the full honors he so richly deserved.  His burial fulfilled a solemn pact – a solemn pact America makes with its each of its defenders and their families – that we will take care of them, and that however much time has passed, they will make it back home. For the Department of Defense, this is a responsibility and an obligation that we are proud to shoulder.  We do whatever it takes to recover every U.S. servicemember held in captivity; and do whatever it takes to find and recover and identify the remains of America’s missing from past conflicts. Today, we are thankful that there are no U.S. troops being anywhere held in captivity.  We know that there are still tens of thousands of fallen Americans who remain missing from many wars.  We must continue to work hard – work hard to bring all of our missing Americans home.  And we will. The United States appreciates the ongoing support of many allies and partners across the globe – many represented here today – and on behalf of the men and women of our military, I thank you.  You have helped us in recovering our missing.  A good example of many of these efforts is Vietnam.  Vietnam has been providing an increasing amount of archival documents to support our pursuit of our missing Americans.  We appreciate these efforts and will continue to build on this partnership going forward. Since we gathered on these parade grounds last September, DoD has been able to account for 71 servicemembers from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.  A year ago, that number was 61.  While this improvement is good, we must do better – we will do better – not only in more effectively accounting for our missing personnel, but also ensuring that their families receive timely and accurate information. As many of you know, earlier this year I directed the Defense Department to organize this effort into a single, accountable operation that has the responsibility for personnel accounting resources, research, and operations… resolving issues of duplication and inefficiency, while also making that organization stronger, more effective, more transparent, and more responsive. DoD has been working closely with everyone who has a stake in this mission – including families, the veterans’ service organizations that are represented here today, and I thank them, Congress, and the agencies’ workforce.  We’ve made progress in this transformation, and the new Defense Personnel Accounting Agency will achieve initial operating capability this January. Fifteen years ago this week, a Vietnam veteran said that “for those of us who were soldiers, that’s our one fear: that somehow we’ll be forgotten.  But let it be known far and wide, around this great nation and around this great world that this nation,” the United States of America, “does not forget. … [It] does not forget its POWs, and for certain, does not forget its MIAs and the families they represent.” Those words still ring true today, and we are privileged today to be joined by the man who spoke them… a man who despite the wounds of war has continued to serve our country with great distinction, commitment, and honor – from the jungles of Vietnam, to lead the Veterans Administration, to the Georgia Statehouse, to the United States Senate, to the American Battle Monuments Commission… a man who I am privileged to now introduce, and am proud to call my longtime friend, former Senate colleague, and fellow Vietnam veteran… a man whose humility, his good grace, his decency, and humanity represent this nation’s finest qualities. Ladies and gentlemen, help me in welcoming Max Cleland.

"July 7, 2015","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee:  thank you for the opportunity to come before you and to address your questions and concerns about this campaign. And I want to especially thank the Chairman for going to Afghanistan over his Fourth of July weekend, which I appreciate. Visiting the troops means a lot to us, sir. And, as all of you know, there is high demand for American leadership in the world – from Asia, where I saw some of you in May, to Europe, where I was two weeks ago.  The Obama Administration and the members of this committee have helped ensure the United States meets that demand.  And I thank you for that. The same is true in the Middle East, where we are standing by our friends, like Israel, working to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and otherwise exercising malign influence, and confronting ISIL, which is the subject of this hearing. It was also the subject of a meeting yesterday at the Pentagon where President Obama, Chairman Dempsey, and I discussed our counter-ISIL campaign with senior defense and interagency leaders.  We all agreed that ISIL represents a grave threat.  And that it must be – and will be – dealt a lasting defeat. That’s our objective, which is shared by a global coalition that reflects both the world-wide consensus on the need to counter ISIL and the practical requirement for others to do their part.  The administration’s strategy to achieve that objective – as the Joint Chiefs’ doctrinal definition of strategy puts it – integrates all our nation’s strengths and instruments of power as has been noted.  And it is executed through nine, synchronized lines of effort. The first, and arguably most, critical line of effort is the political one, as has also been noted, which is led by the State Department.  This line involves building more effective, inclusive, and multi-sectarian governance in Iraq. At the same time, the United States continues to work diplomatically to bring about a political transition from Bashar al-Assad to a more inclusive government with which we can also work to defeat ISIL. The next two lines of effort are interconnected – to deny ISIL safe haven, and to build partner capacity in Iraq and Syria.  Both are led by the Department of Defense, which, alongside coalition partners, is conducting an air campaign, advising and assisting Iraqi Security Forces on the ground, and training and equipping vetted local forces in Iraq and for Syria. Before I go on, let me say that these first three political and military lines of effort have to be in sync – a point that’s been made already.  That’s a challenge, but one that we are working through with our partners in the coalition, on the ground, and around our government. The fourth line of effort is enhancing intelligence collection on ISIL, which is led by the National Counterterrorism Center.  The fifth line of effort, disrupting ISIL’s finances, is co-led by Treasury and State. Lines of effort six and seven, both co-led by State and the National Counterterrorism Center, are to counter ISIL’s messaging and disrupt the flow of foreign fighters to and from ISIL, both of which are critical in today’s connected and networked world.  The eighth line of effort, providing humanitarian support to those affected by the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, is led by State and [US]AID. Finally, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Department of Justice are working together to protect the homeland – the ninth line of effort – by disrupting terrorist threats.  In addition to our full-spectrum cooperative relationship with Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies, DoD personnel continue to strike ISIL elements in Iraq and Syria. The effective execution of all nine of these lines of effort by the United States and its coalition partners is necessary to ensure ISIL’s lasting defeat. I want to add briefly that there are important classified dimensions to our approach to ISIL and to the Middle East more broadly, Mr. Chairman, that we won’t be able to discuss in this meeting, but can discuss separately. Let me turn to the execution of the two lines of effort on which DoD leads, which our personnel have been performing with the excellence we all expect of the finest fighting force the world has ever known. American service members, and their coalition partners, have conducted over 5,000 airstrikes.  That air campaign has produced some clear tactical results: limiting ISIL’s freedom of movement, constraining its ability to reinforce its fighters, and degrading its command and control.  Coalition air support has also enabled gains by local forces in Iraq and Syria, including Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces, who recently took the key border town of Tal Abyad from ISIL, cut one of its key lines of communication and supply,and put ISIL on the defensive and its stronghold in Raqqah under pressure. Those examples demonstrate, again, that where we have had a credible ground force working in a coordinated way with the coalition air campaign, ISIL has suffered.  That is what makes the third line of effort – developing the capacity and capabilities of local ground forces – so important.  Indeed, we know from recent experience that success against ISIL requires capable, local, ground forces.  And we know from our history in the region that putting U.S. combat troops on the ground as a substitute for local forces will not produce enduring results. That’s why we’re bolstering Iraq’s security forces and building moderate, vetted Syrian opposition forces.  But both of these efforts need strengthening. In Iraq, the Iraqi security forces were severely degraded after four divisions dissolved and Mosul fell a year ago this June.  Our efforts to build partner capacity and advise and assist ongoing operations involve around 3,550 American personnel at six locations around the country.  Their training work has been slowed, however, by a lack of trainees: as of June 30, we’ve only received enough trainees to be able to train about 8,800 Iraqi Army soldiers and Peshmerga forces, in addition to some 2,000 CTS personnel.  Another 4,000 soldiers, including 600 CTS personnel, were in training.  I’ve told Iraqi leaders that while the United States is open to supporting Iraq more than we already are, we must see a greater commitment from all parts of the Iraqi government. We’re also in the early stages of our train-and-equip mission in Syria.  Three months into our program, training is underway, and we are working to screen and vet almost 7,000 volunteers to ensure they are committed to fighting ISIL, pass a counterintelligence screening, and meet standards prescribed by U.S. law – regarding the law of armed conflict – and necessitated by operations.  As of July 3, we are currently training about 60 fighters.  This number is much smaller than we hoped for at this point, partly because of the vetting standards I just described. But we know this program is essential: we need a partner on the ground in Syria to assure ISIL’s lasting defeat.  And, as training progresses, we are learning more about the opposition groups and building important relationships, which increases our ability to attract recruits and provides valuable intelligence for counter-ISIL operations. We are also working to equip vetted local forces.  In Iraq, after earlier delays, we’re expediting delivery of essential equipment and materiel to the Iraqi Security Forces – and working with the Government of Iraq to ensure this equipment is quickly passed to Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal forces.  In Syria, we’ll begin equipping forces as soon as they complete training. We are constantly assessing this approach – we did so after the fall of Ramadi, and continued through yesterday with President Obama at the Pentagon.  The strategy’s the right one, but its execution can and will be strengthened…especially on the ground.  In Iraq, we’re focused on increasing participation in and throughput of our training facilities.  An example of this is our effort at Taqqadum – which has been noted – in Anbar Province, where we recently deployed approximately 350 of the additional 450 American personnel authorized.  We assessed our presence at this military base would provide access to thousands of previously unreachable Sunni tribesmen.  This is in support of the Iraqi government’s own initiative to increase outreach to the Anbar tribes.  As of mid-June, the Iraqi government has enrolled and armed an initial group of 800 Sunni fighters at Taqaddum, and we are supporting the Iraqi training of 500 additional fighters now at Taqaddum.  The Iraqis have already identified 500 more trainees that will follow the current group.  And we’ll continue to work to ensure that these Sunni fighters, which are critical to the success of our campaign, have the training and equipment needed to effectively fight ISIL. I should also note that the Anbar Operations Center is located at Taqaddum, which is another reason for that particular geography, so that we can advise and assist the Iraqi commanders there commanding Sunni forces. In Syria, we seek to capitalize on recent successes in Kobane and Tal Abyad and continue to strike ISIL’s nerve center in Raqqah.  At the same time, we are looking for ways to streamline our train and equip program’s vetting process – which I noted earlier – to get more recruits into the training pipeline.  We are also refining our curriculum, expanding our outreach to the moderate opposition, and incorporating lessons learned from the first training class.  I’m happy to speak about that more. In conclusion, I’ve sought to describe to you clearly the strategy, the Department of Defense’s execution of its critical lines of effort, and where our execution can – and will – and must – be strengthened. Achieving ISIL’s lasting defeat will require continued commitment… steady leadership – from the United States and our global coalition…hard work by our men and women in uniform…essential complementary and synchronized efforts along the other seven lines of effort…and, most importantly, commitment and sacrifice by Iraqis and Syrians.  Together, and with your continuing support for the men and women of the Department of Defense, for which we are ever grateful, we will achieve ISIL’s lasting defeat. Thank you.

"Oct. 19, 2017","Minister Lieberman, Ambassador, members of the delegation, it is always good to have you here. We meet today to reaffirm our two democracies’ strong relationship.  It is good to go back to principles sometimes. In 1948, President Truman recognized Israel’s independence within hours of its declaration. Since then, Israel and the U.S. have developed what President Reagan called an “ironclad bond,” forged by shared democratic values, regional security concerns, and global security concerns – and in this case, regional security really is global security.  Today, Israel and the United States partner to confront myriad threats posed by nations in Israel’s neighborhood wishing to foment instability – instability that reverberates around the world. And we appreciate those in region who choose, instead, to promote stability.  It is critical, today more than ever, that we foster integrated responses to these threats and reinforce our already robust collaboration on key security issues by forming working groups that expand and deepen our relationship in this dynamic environment.  Today, we will discuss how we can further strengthen our security relationship. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the regional security situation and what issues concern you most. Minister, members of the delegation, thank you for coming.

"Feb. 1, 2018","Secretary of State for Defence Williamson, Sir Kim, members of the U.K. delegation, welcome to Washington and welcome to the Pentagon. It is a pleasure to continue our conversation following our November meeting in London. The United States is proud to strengthen our special relationship with the United Kingdom. It’s an unmatched bond, as we all know so well, forged from common values, but also shared sacrifice in the crucible of wars. Over a century of shared battlefield experiences from the Marne in World War I to the battlefields in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, the U.S. and U.K. have stoically stood shoulder-to- shoulder against all adversaries. Secretary Williamson, as you said in January, we face intensifying threats from “state-based aggression,” from rogue nations like DPRK and Iran to revisionist powers as different as China and Russia. In the face of these threats, we value the U.K.’s diplomatic, moral and military leadership on the European and global stages, particularly as Russia seeks to undermine and weaken NATO’s cohesion and capabilities. And in the face of North Korea’s outlaw actions as well, our nations stand together with all other members of the UNSC, resolved to end the unnecessary and destabilizing provocations. Recognizing a world awash in change, the United States has identified priorities through our recently released National Defense Strategy, just as the United Kingdom is doing now under your leadership on your National Security Capability Review. We appreciate your steadfast efforts to preserve and adapt the United Kingdom’s critical defense capabilities. I welcome your team’s keen appreciation of these challenges that we all face and the resources required to meet them, because our democracies can afford survival, and because peace-loving nations need to know that Britain’s traditional, moral voice is strengthened by a capable military. As close allies, we stand with you to retain our special military relationship in a world where no nation can alone provide for its security – and these efforts are vital, ensuring survival of our two nations’ way of life. Secretary Williamson, we will again be discussing pragmatic ways to bolster our defense cooperation as we carry out our responsibility to strengthen our special relationship, turning it over to the next generation stronger than we inherited it. Thank you and your delegation for traveling here.  You, your officers and your ideas are always welcome in the Pentagon. Thank you. # # # ",Remarks at Bilateral Meeting with Secretary of State for Defence Williamson,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1430126/remarks-at-bilateral-meeting-with-secretary-of-state-for-defence-williamson/
"Dec. 15, 2016","Thanks very much, Secretary Fallon – appreciate your hosting us today so that we can all receive an update on the execution of our counter-ISIL coalition military campaign plan we devised a year ago and are carrying out now. It’s great to be here in London with all of you to discuss – to use Michael’s apt word – how to continue to build the momentum, accelerate our campaign to deliver ISIL the certain and lasing defeat it deserves.  And I’m particularly pleased we’re joined by two special guests, staunch members of our coalition: Turkey’s Minister of Defense Isik – Fikri, good to see you – and Iraqi Security Forces Chief of Staff General Othman, with whom I was just in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.  Thank you both for coming. It was nearly a year ago when this core coalition first met in Paris to lay out the coalition military campaign plan that the world has watched unfold since.  We were brought together then – as we are today – by our shared values, by our resolve to deal ISIL a lasting defeat, and by our unwavering commitment to seize every opportunity to accelerate the campaign.  And over this past year, we’ve now met six times – each time more confident in the rightness of our cause, more certain of the outcome, and more determined to see this fight through to the end. Today, we meet having reached a critical milestone in the campaign, as our forces are engaged in an intense effort to help isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over both Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria – the first, primary objective of our campaign. While we’ll hear from our CENTCOM commander General Joe Votel about the latest operational results, and also from General Othman, I should note that I too was just in Iraq.  And there, I met with Prime Minister Abadi, Kurdish Regional Government President Barzani, and our coalition commander Lieutenant General Steve Townsend.  And in addition, I visited the strategically important Qayyarah West airfield, which the Iraqi Security Forces seized in July, and which has now become the critical launchpad for the Mosul operation.  And I met with some of the brave Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga who have been engaged in the tough fight to take Mosul.  And after being in Iraq, I see that while this complex mission will take time to accomplish, I was encouraged during my visit that the operation is proceeding according to the plan, and I’m confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered. And simultaneously, in Syria, we’re now helping tens of thousands of local, capable, motivated forces to isolate and systematically envelop Raqqa, from which they are only 15 miles away. As we’ve done before at critical junctures in our campaign, the United States is taking additional actions to accelerate our efforts.  Just last week I announced that we’ll deploy some additional 200 – an additional 200 U.S. forces to Syria to join the 300 U.S. special operations forces that are already there.  These 500 personnel represent some of our military’s most uniquely specialized warfighters.  More importantly, they’re the connective tissue between our thousands of local partners and the great weight of American and coalition military might that we’re bringing to bear, through them, against ISIL.  As they help to generate additional capable, motivated, local forces to seize and ultimately hold Raqqa, they will also continue working with our Turkish allies, both on this effort and to secure the border region in northern Syria, and we will also seek to deny ISIL a safe haven in southern Syria.  And today, the United States continues to be committed to accelerate ISIL’s defeat everywhere we see opportunities – doing more – and we will discuss how others in the coalition can do the same. Now, while we’re collapsing ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa, and doing that is necessary to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, it’s not sufficient. Indeed, we must and are combatting ISIL – the ISIL cancer’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world, which is the second objective of our campaign.  And we’ve been doing so successfully in Libya, and also in Afghanistan – where I also just visited a few days ago – to take two examples in particular. Destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and combatting its metastases are critical to destroying both the fact and the idea that there can be an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology.  But more immediately – and Michael made this point very well, it’s also critical – doing so is also critical to stopping plots against our homelands and our people, which is the third and really the most important objective, for our people, of our campaign.  Here, working with intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners, coalition forces are conducting operations to gather intelligence with a particular focus on destroying ISIL’s external operations network.  As a result, we’ve not only killed the chief of ISIL’s external operations; we’ve also taken out dozens of its external plotters – including three last week in Raqqa who were directly involved in attacks and the plotting of attacks against our European allies.  And today we’ll discuss how we further counter this threat. Now, going forward, we must stay focused on the continued execution of the campaign plan into 2017.  That’s among the most important topics we’ll discuss today, because there’s more work still to be done. In addition to putting ISIL on the path to a lasting defeat, we’ll need to continue to counter not only the foreign fighters trying to escape ISIL, but also ISIL’s attempts to relocate or to reinvent itself.  Destroying, as I said, the fact and idea that there can be an Islamic state based on this ideology will help us in several ways to destroy ISIL’s external operations ambitions.  So it’s important.  To do so, both the United States and the coalition must remain engaged militarily.  And in Iraq in particular, we must be prepared to provide sustained assistance to the Iraqi Security Forces to consolidate security over the rest of the country, and to carry on our work to train, equip, and support local police, border guards, and other forces to hold areas cleared from ISIL – as always, in partnership with the Iraqi government. Beyond security, there still will be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  These aren’t military matters, but they’re part of how, after winning the battle, one wins the peace.  That’s why the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts must not lag behind the military campaign. There will also need to be continued political support for an inclusive, multi-sectarian Iraq.  We’ve seen how the threat of ISIL has brought people together against it.  In Iraq, for instance, thanks to the unity and the leadership of Prime Minister Abadi and Kurdish Regional Government President Barzani – both of whom I saw just a few days ago, once again – cooperation between the ISF and the Peshmerga in the battle for Mosul has reached a level that would’ve been unthinkable when we first met a year ago.  And now the coalition is taking steps to help promote and maintain this unity, and we must, because that’s the only way to ensure that ISIL stays defeated. The counter-ISIL coalition has been decisive and effective, with over a third of the forces coming from non-U.S. partners.  We all came together, deliberately, as a coalition to defeat ISIL, and today, I look forward to discussing how the coalition will continue to endure, to work together, to contribute together, and to operate together to make sure ISIL’s defeat is lasting. Let me close by thanking all of you around this table for your continued resolve and strength and wisdom in this fight.  And while I can’t speak for the next presidential administration in the United States, I’m confident that based on the results we’re seeing and the strength of our coalition, the United States and its military will continue to be with you as a leading partner in this campaign.  And by reflecting on the lessons we’ve learned to date and remaining focused on the execution of our plan, we’ll ensure that ISIL is delivered the lasting defeat it deserves. Thanks, Michael. ",Opening Remarks at Counter-ISIL Defense Ministerial,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1030529/opening-remarks-at-counter-isil-defense-ministerial/
"March 3, 2016","Thanks, Brad. Appreciate it. Thank you so much, Brad. And thank all of you — thank all of you for being here. This is the way it ought to be—the military community and the larger community together; the security imperative and our competitive and technological imperatives coming together, reinforcing one another. So this meeting, which was Microsoft's idea and I really salute you for it. I'm grateful to have the opportunity. It signifies everything we need to do to protect our people and make a better world for our children. So I thank you all for what you do every day in that cause individually, but for coming together today. Governor, thank you for being here. You honor us with your presence. And I for what I call our folks, our family, everybody, just looking out here at our guys in uniform, I just have to say that — people say what was it like to be Secretary of Defense, you know, you have all these burdens; you have all these — I say, ""No, look how proud it can be of these people."" I'm so proud to be the Secretary of Defense for our military. And Steve is one guy who is here who I go back with a way, which is Steve Monza. We were just talking now. We go back to Iraq — back in another cycle and he did absolutely amazing things there, and now holds down a major part of our responsibility here. And our responsibility here is the topic about which I thought I'd make a few remarks and then we're going to do — Brad's going to ask some questions, and then I'll take questions or comments from anybody out there. The theme is the importance of the bond between the U.S. military and our fellow citizens in so many domains. It's not something we can take for granted as generations change, as technology changes, as society changes. And people are, I know, and they tell me all the time are very grateful for what those folks do for our country. They know that it's the finest fighting force the world has ever known. They're glad of that. But they also expect that it will stay that way 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. And I have the responsibility of fighting today's wars and also making sure that we can dominate tomorrow's security landscape. Earlier this week, I gave a speech down in San Francisco about the role that the Defense Department plays in ensuring the security of the global marketplace, upon which Seattle depends. I was in San Francisco at the time — San Francisco depends. And we do this. We do it in every domain — air, land, sea, space, cyberspace.  And we do it so companies like Microsoft and the others represented in this room can do what they do best — helping empower people through technology and helping our people reach their full potential. This is a role that America and its military — this global role — have had since the end of World War II; one we continue to fulfill today. And it's one we intend to continue to fulfill, even as we enter what really is a new strategic era — engaging with a security environment that's dramatically different from the last 25 years. I want to give you a sense of what we're focused on these days in the Pentagon. There are no fewer than five central evolving — central challenges that drive our planning now in the Defense Department — our planning, our budgeting, our activities, our operations — namely, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and terrorism.  And I'll briefly describe each of them to you this morning before I go more deeply into the issues that I know are top of mind for this community. The first two of those challenges, China and Russia, reflect in a way a return to great power competition. One is in Europe, where we're taking a strong — have to take a strong and balanced approach to deterring Russian aggression on the continent of the kind we've seen. Second challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region of the world to America's future — half of humanity, half of the economy, only growing; where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats to specific regions. North Korea is one, and that's why our forces, and we never take our eye off this, our forces on the Korean peninsula remain ready, as their slogan goes, to fight tonight — not something we want to do, but something we're ready to do.  And the other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal in preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and check Iranian malign influence in the region, and protect allies and friends, including especially Israel. The fifth challenge, very different from the four and critically important, is our ongoing fight against terrorism, especially ISIL, which must be and will be dealt a lasting defeat, most immediately, in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria where we're accelerating our campaign in every dimension, including cyber, by the way, as well as where ISIL's is metastasizing around the world. We're doing it in North Africa. We're also doing that in Afghanistan, where we continue to stand with the Afghan government and people to counter ISIL and Al Qaeda. And at the same time, all the while we're continuing to work with other government agencies on protecting our homeland and protecting our people here. We don't have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges. We have to deal with them all. But we do have the ability to set a course for the future — a future that's uncertain, but that will certainly be competitive and demanding of America's leadership, our values, our military edge. The forces and capabilities we have based here in the Pacific Northwest are and continue to be a critical part of that — the ships and submarines that patrol the seas, ensure the free flow of commerce; to the cyber mission forces that help protect and defend networks online; and the troops and airmen who are building and strengthening our relationship with our many friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific. They're our military is the greatest first and foremost because of the people represented here and the people they lead. That's why we have all the friends and allies around the world, and our antagonists don't. People like to work with our folks. They like to work with American soldiers. They conduct themselves decently. They're competent. They like working with them. And they like the values that America stands for. That's attractive. And those people and those values are two of the things that make our military the greatest. But the third is and has been for decades and decades, technology — the strength of our connection to technology and innovation. And we need to innovate. We need to do it together for the future because that's the way to make sure that we have the finest fighting force in the world tomorrow, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now. So one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build and to rebuild bridges between the Pentagon and communities like Seattle and San Francisco and Boston and many others — all places where companies like yours — ones represented in this room — continue to thrive and innovate and benefit our society and our security. And I'm going to be actually visiting some of them while I'm out there. I visited some yesterday. I'm especially grateful to Microsoft for building that bridge from the other direction, from your public service sabbatical — this is a big deal, by the way — program, public service sabbatical program, I encourage others to do the same thing; high-level engagement between DOD leaders and your CEO, Satya Nadella, which I'm very grateful for; and now here today, through connections at the community level. We need partners like Microsoft and the others in this room because I always tell people we don't build anything in the Pentagon. That's not the American way. The Soviet Union tried that; didn't work out very well for them. We have the best technology because we have a connection to the most innovative technology community in the world. That's why. And that's been true for decades and it's still true. But the context is changing. When I began my career in this business, most technology of consequence came from America and much of that from the government. Now, American technology is still strong and government investment — $72 billion a year in our case this coming year — is still strong.  But there's no question the global technology base is commercialized and globalized compared to when I started out. That's a very different environment within which we have to keep an innovative defense. So to make sure that our military stays the best in a changing and competitive world, we're investing aggressively in innovation from everything — undersea drones, cybersecurity, missiles that can fly five times the speed of sound, things we don't talk about because we want them to be surprising to anybody who tries anything with us. We're doing a lot. One important place we're investing is cybersecurity. Like so many businesses here, we in the Defense Department rely abjectly on network security. None of our stuff works — the planes, ships, tanks, soldiers and everything, they need the network to be effective. So defending our networks and our weapons systems is job one for me in the cyber area. They're no good if they've been hacked.  And here, I have to say, Microsoft has been a great partner to DOD. We're making a Department-wide transition over the next year to the much more secure Windows 10 operating system. This is a big deal. It's unprecedented for both DOD, and I believe for Microsoft as well. And it means that 4 million desktops, laptops and tablets will be better equipped inherently to defend themselves against cyber threats. And I'm looking forward later today to seeing how Microsoft is pushing the envelope in cyber defense when I visit its new Cybersecurity Operations Center later today. As DOD makes these investments, we're also doing more to connect with America's innovative business and technology community. For example, last year I opened a defense innovation hub in Silicon Valley and plan to do more, by the way, to explore ways we can better partner with companies here on the West Coast — essentially, an outpost of the Pentagon on the West Coast. There's also a new Defense Digital Service, which brings coders in for what we call a tour of duty. They come in — these are talented people who think they want to do something that matters, something of consequence, go home and tell their family that they did something that's bigger than themselves — the noblest thing they could do.  And they come in — you know, they're not going to make a career, but — they're not going to join. They're not going to be part of the government. But they come in for a year or two, or a project, and make a contribution to us. And the leader of the Defense Digital — Chris, where are you? That's Chris Lynch over there is the head of the Defense Digital Service. I brought him with me.  He's been a serial entrepreneur in the tech world, living in Seattle, actually, for a time — even spent some time at Microsoft. And since Chris has been with us, he and his team have solved some really important problems for us. I'll give you just one example of one thing they dived in and took on, and that is improving data sharing between DOD and the V.A. to make sure our veterans get access to their benefits. That may sound like something that we should've done right in the first place, but the reality is we didn't, and Chris and his team came in there — crack people — turned the whole thing around in a few weeks. He's done such a good job cutting through red tape that he even gets to look like that in the Pentagon. Stand up, Chris. He wears a hoodie in the Pentagon every day. And that's not all we're doing. Yesterday I announced two other important initiatives. One is the DOD is going to invite vetted hackers to test our cybersecurity under a unique pilot called ""Hack the Pentagon"". This is similar to the bug bounties that Microsoft and other companies have, and it would be the first one ever in the entire federal government. And the objective here is to let the white hats help us find vulnerabilities before the black hats do. They do it for free, they do for sport, they do it for the distinction of having done it. I hope they don't succeed, but if they succeed, we'll learn something. It's a great idea, borrowing best practices from the outside world, where they can apply to us, and using them to improve ourselves. The other initiative is that I'm creating a new Defense Innovation Board to advise me on how to remain innovative in the Defense Department — how to build that bridge to the technology community, how to look at ourselves in the mirror and see how can we change to be more competitive, take advantage.  And we'll always be different, right — we're the profession of arms. It's never going to be the same. It's not a company — it's the military. But that doesn't mean we can't learn things from people who have been innovative outside.  I'm very pleased that Eric Schmidt, from Google's parent company, Alphabet, has agreed to chair the Defense Innovation Board for me, and I hope we'll see some innovators from the Seattle area joining that board as well. They'll advise me and those who come after me on how DOD can better connect to innovation and make better use of it, including, as I said, changing ourselves where that's appropriate. I often say that we in the Pentagon — I really mean — have to think outside of our five-sided box. I want to make sure there's enough time for me to answer your course questions. Let me close by saying the obvious, really, which is this is a tremendous time of excitement, not just because of the dangers we face, which I'm confident we'll overcome, because we have the resolve and the strength and the will and the force to do so. But because it reminds of a different era, and one we can replicate — the kind of collaboration between companies, the government, academia that built the Internet and GPS — and I remember those days — or an earlier era — communication satellites, the jet engine — I have to say I don't remember that. I do remember the others. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots and lots of interesting challenges and problems for you to work on. And it's also true for those interested in technology — the intersection of the two is an opportunity-rich environment for the innovative mind. These issues matter. It's not a game. This is about our protection and our security, and creating a world in which our citizens can wake up in the morning, hug their kids, take them to school, go to work, dream their dreams, live their lives. That's what it's all about, and you can't do that if you don't have security. It's our job to provide that, and to do that well now and in the future, we have to keep thinking, we have to keep changing, we have to keep challenging ourselves. And for those who are inclined to join this noble enterprise in one way or another, I just say the way I feel myself, which is that helping to defend your country and make a better world is one of the noblest things that you can spend your time doing. I'm grateful to all of you in this community who directly and indirectly do that with me. Thank you.  ","Remarks to Seattle-area Technology, Business, Community, and Military Leaders",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/685701/remarks-to-seattle-area-technology-business-community-and-military-leaders/
"Jan. 13, 2016","First though, I want to start off with some good news about some of your fellow service members in the Persian Gulf. The ten U.S. Navy sailors departed Iran early this morning, and are now back safe in U.S. hands. I am very pleased that this was resolved quickly, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Secretary of State Kerry for his efforts… and to reaffirm to you that our highest commitment is to the safety of all of you. Wherever we may ask you to go, the country will never leave an American servicemember behind. Many of you will deploy soon, and not for the first time. I know that you serve without hesitation, as the Screaming Eagles have always done, but I also know the hardships that can come with every one of those deployments. Stephanie and I are always thinking about your families, who serve, we know, as well as you do. So please thank them on our behalf for supporting you as you keep us safe. It’s been said that security is like oxygen. When people have enough of it, they tend to pay no attention to it. But when they don’t have enough, it’s all they can think of. You provide that oxygen, not only for the people of the United States but in many cases for people around the world. You give them the security that makes everything else in life possible – the freedom to dream their dreams, raise their children and live lives that are full. You do that. It’s a big world out there, and we are a great nation, with extraordinary responsibilities, opportunities, and challenges around the world. One of those challenges, which you will soon confront, is the threat that ISIL poses not just to the Middle East but to the world. As you heard the President say last night, we must, we can, and we will deliver a lasting defeat to ISIL. That’s why back in the fall, at the President’s direction, I worked with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford and General Lloyd Austin, our superb CENTCOM Commander to – and all our commanders on the ground – I should add, our excellent commanders on the ground, which you will shortly join, to accelerate our campaign against ISIL. We proposed a number of military actions – all of which the President approved – to gather momentum against ISIL. The attacks in Paris, San Bernardino and elsewhere which occurred after we began this acceleration underscored, for anybody who doubted it, the necessity of this campaign. Since then, we have not only gathered momentum but done even more, and are now pressuring ISIL in Iraq and Syria on more fronts than at any other point in the campaign. This pressure is having an effect, and it is also generating additional opportunities to further accelerate the campaign. As we continuously adapt and accelerate the campaign, we will intensify the pressure on ISIL, not just in Iraq and Syria, but in other regions where they have emerged, using a variety of tools at our disposal. It won’t be easy. ISIL is a cancer that’s threatening to spread. And like all cancers, you can’t cure the disease just by cutting out the tumor. You have to eliminate it wherever it has spread, and stop it from coming back. Our military campaign accordingly focuses on three military objectives: One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its two power centers in Mosul and Raqqah. Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide, and three, protect the homeland. And to do it, we’re going to enable local, motivated forces and an international coalition with a clear campaign plan, with American leadership, and with all of our awesome capabilities – ranging from air strikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, to training, advice, and assistance from those on the ground – including you. Let me map for you where we are headed this year and where you’ll be headed. The ISIL parent tumor has two centers – Raqqah in Syria, and Mosul in Iraq. ISIL has used its control of these cities and nearby territories as a power base from which to derive considerable financial resources, manpower, and ideological outreach. They constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic, and ideological centers of gravity. That’s why our campaign plan’s map has got big arrows pointing at both Mosul and Raqqah. We will begin by collapsing ISIL’s control over both of these cities and then engage in elimination operations through other territories ISIL holds in Iraq and Syria. This defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria is a vital and necessary – although not sufficient – component of our worldwide campaign to defeat ISIL. And as I have said previously, President Obama is committed to doing what it takes – as opportunities arise, as we see what works, and as the enemy adapts – until ISIL is delivered a lasting defeat. Last month I visited with the men and women you will relieve in Baghdad and Erbil. They helped me gain a first-hand perspective on what more we can do to execute this campaign plan, and I have since relayed these observations and those of their commanding officers to our Commander in Chief. As I spoke with our troops, and with our partners and our allies, it became apparent that the additional military steps that President Obama approved in the fall are generating significant momentum across the battlefield in Iraq and Syria. We can see that our actions to accelerate the campaign are having an effect, and moreover, are creating yet more opportunities to do even more. We are taking ground back from the enemy and gaining openings.  We are denying ISIL the ability to move fighters and materiel by cutting off key transit routes to, and between, Raqqah and Mosul. We are dismantling ISIL’s war-sustaining finances, targeting its oil production and its industrial base, and we’re using some new methods to hit ISIL in its wallet. Just this week we hit a major ISIL bulk cash center in Mosul, depriving ISIL of financial resources is an essential part of the shaping operation for Mosul, and we will continue these kinds of operations as part of the overall effort to degrade its financing. Throughout Iraq and Syria we are significantly constraining its ability either to defend or attack, and we are working with our partners to take advantage of every opportunity this presents. And the specialized expeditionary targeting force I announced in December is now in place and is preparing to work with the Iraqis to begin going after ISIL’s fighters and commanders, killing or capturing them wherever we find them, along with other key targets. In Syria, we’re combining the effects of our air campaign with support to local forces to isolate, pressure, and eventually collapse ISIL control over its so-called capital in Raqqah. In November, a coalition of Syrian Arabs that we helped equip in northern Syria fighting alongside Kurdish and Turkmen forces recaptured important terrain along the Turkey-Syria border. And in just the past few weeks, with our advice, these forces also captured the Tishreen Dam and surrounding villages, cutting off a critical logistics route for ISIL in Raqqah. All these forces build momentum towards Raqqah, and as they do so other local forces can be expected to join the winning side. To build on these efforts, President Obama, on my and Chairman Dunford and General Austin's advice, ordered the most elite U.S. special operations forces to go into Syria to support the fight against ISIL. American special operators, as you well know, bring a unique set of capabilities that make them force multipliers, such as intelligence gathering, targeting, and the ability to provide advice and assistance, or accompany local forces to the front lines to help make them victorious. Through even a small number of these highly trained operators, the full might of America’s airstrikes, intelligence, logistics and know-how can be relentlessly focused on the enemy. And while I cannot give you specifics, I can tell you these forces have already established contact with new forces that share our goals, new lines of communication to local, motivated and capable fighters, and new targets for airstrikes and strikes of all kinds. These operators have helped focus the efforts of the local, capable forces against key ISIL vulnerabilities, including their lines of communication. They are generating new insights that we turn into new targets, new strikes, and new opportunities. In short, they are generating a virtuous cycle of actions. Actions which help identify and marshal the strength of yet more local forces.  Action which is leading to more intelligence. Action which is generating new tactical and operational ideas. Action which flushes ISIL out into the open, shrinking its power base, its finances and its space to maneuver. And action that sends an unmistakable message to both ISIL and the moderate Syrian opposition that the United States and the coalition it leads will prevail in this fight. ISIL must and will be dealt a lasting defeat, a lasting defeat in Syria and Iraq. The defeat must be lasting, so that similar extremism does not recur and emerge from the same places after the campaign. For the defeat to be lasting, it has to achieved and sustained by local forces that are motivated and capable. That’s where you come in. Frankly, I know the 101st has taken Mosul before, and you could do it again. We could deploy multiple brigades on the ground and arrive in force. But then it would likely become our fight, and our fight alone. Moreover, we’d have to fight on the enemy’s terms, and give up our greatest advantages – mobility, firepower, and precision. Because the United States is not just the finest fighting force the world has ever seen, and not just because of our overwhelming assets, but we are that because of the extraordinary agility, intelligence, training and precision of professionals like you. Going in alone would also Americanize the conflict, giving ISIL the chance to call it a foreign occupation, persuading some of those who are resisting ISIL to fight us instead, and feeding the anti-Western story ISIL has been pushing all along as it tries to inspire acts of terror around the world. And finally, in the long term, after ISIL was initially defeated, there would still remain the problem of securing and governing the territory – tasks that must be accomplished, in the end, by local forces. And in the end, therefore, we can enable such local forces, but we cannot entirely substitute for them. Now another possibility, at the other end of the spectrum, would be to leave Syria and Iraq to their fates and just try to prevent ISIL from spreading elsewhere and in our homeland. But that kind of indirect approach simply cannot succeed in today’s connected and volatile world. That would just give ISIL a safe haven from which to spread its destructive influence, and it would surrender the strong and principled global leadership the United States stands for. So we can’t ignore this fight – and we also can’t win it entirely from the outside-in. That’s why our strategic approach is to help local, motivated and capable forces on the ground in every way that we can without taking their place. That’s why your mission is central to our strategy. It’s worth noting that it was Iraqi soldiers who took back the city center of Ramadi and are fighting every day to clear the remainder of the city, proving themselves not only motivated but capable. These same Iraqi forces, supported where needed by the United States and our coalition partners, aim to deliver the same results to the people who have been brutalized in every town on the road to the border in Anbar and on the road up to Mosul. These devastated towns and villages need to be secured, they need to be rebuilt, and they need to be governed. The only way for that to happen is for local, motivated forces to take the lead and take responsibility for their homes, so you can return to yours. As Ramadi showed, our unmatched capabilities can enable and multiply the power and force of our local partners. We’re clearing the battlefield with precision strikes. We’re giving them equipment, and training on how to use it, including, just to give one example, the temporary bridge that helped Iraqi troops cross the Euphrates when ISIL had blown up all the bridges in town. We’re giving them training, advice and assistance in modern warfare, including engineering and logistics. And we are prepared to do more where and when we can have an additional strategic effect. The training you will provide Iraqi forces – both the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga – will be critical, as the Peshmerga approach Mosul from the north to close with the Iraqi Security Forces and Counterterrorism Service approaching from the south. Reaching and retaking Mosul will not be easy, and it will not be quick. There will be many engagements in between. Logistics will become a greater challenge as the ISF moves farther from Baghdad, and the need for operational support from the coalition will likely grow. But as our success in Ramadi and north and central Iraq has shown, training, advising, and assisting rather than trying to substitute entirely for local forces is the right approach. And when we see something that works, we look for ways to do more of it whenever and wherever it can have a strategic effect as we collapse ISIL’s hold on its remaining territory in Iraq. Now I’ve described the focus of our military campaign plan in Iraq and Syria – that’s you. But there are others who must step up and meet critical challenges that go beyond military action. The military campaign is necessary but not sufficient. For our military efforts to produce lasting effects, we must set the conditions for sustainable political stability in the region. And that means everybody has to be in the game. I don’t need to tell you how complex a city like Mosul is, and I’m not about to tell you that it’s your job to keep everyone working together when the fighting is done. It’s the diplomats and development experts who are helping the Government of Iraq follow through on rebuilding and restoring opportunity to Sunni regions so the local people have a future worth fighting for themselves. It’s Secretary Kerry’s efforts to help resolve the civil war in Syria and restore order and decency to that shattered country. We need financial experts at the Department of Treasury involved in cutting off the flow of money to ISIL. We need our intelligence agencies to help us map ISIL’s networks, leadership, and infrastructure, so we can target the organization as effectively as possible, and we need them to look out for any surprises that might be waiting for you out there. We need our law enforcement and homeland security to redouble their efforts to be on the lookout for the threat back home while you take care of the threat over there. All this is what the Commander in Chief has ordered. Finally, I need to say that we need Congress to empower us to take a more aggressive and more agile approach, the very approach that we know many of them want us to take and know we need to take, and that I’ve chartered out here. And that includes for Congress fully approving pending funding requests we have for funding the fight in Syria – those funds have been held up. Next – the campaign is not up to the U.S. alone to accomplish. The lasting defeat of ISIL must be a global undertaking, because it’s a global threat. And any nation that cares about the safety of its people or the future of its civilization must know this – America will continue to lead the fight, but there can be no free riders. That means that as we invest in the acceleration of the campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners and every nation in a position to help. That means greater military contributions, but it also means greater diplomatic, political, and economic engagement. It means development and reconstruction. It means actions at home and abroad to disrupt, dismantle and degrade ISIL’s capabilities. It means stepping up. And I have personally reached out to my counterparts, the ministers of defense in over 40 countries around the world to ask them to contribute to enhancing the fight against ISIL – more special operations forces, more strike and reconnaissance aircraft, weapons and munitions, training assistance, as well as combat support and combat service support. Many nations are already contributing greatly. Many can do more. And some are on the wrong track entirely. We don’t ask for favors, but neither do we grant favors. We recognize that nations follow their own best interests, as we follow ours. That means that they themselves must accelerate their efforts disrupting the networks that enable the flow of foreign fighters and material through their lands. That means joining and taking advantage of the opportunity to fight ISIL in Iraq and Syria, before it becomes a more serious threat to their public. And for Muslim-majority nations in particular, that means stepping forward and debunking ISIL’s false claims to religious or ideological excuses for brutality. There is also an opportunity for those nations who have been on the wrong side of this fight so far – Russia and Iran. They can make a difference too by stopping their unending support for Bashar Assad – a chief instigator of radicalism and terrorism in Syria. I have seen the strength of our coalition – and our success depends on building on that strength. During my most recent Middle East trip, I walked the flight line with German and Turkish pilots at Incirlik, Turkey, spoke with Spanish troops, United Kingdom troops, and saw NATO aircraft take to the skies to strike ISIL targets. And on the deck of the Charles de Gaulle, the French aircraft carrier, I embraced our French brothers in arms as they entered the Gulf and prepared to resume the air campaign against the terrorists who struck Paris in November. Next week, I will meet with my counterparts, ministers of defense from six nations that are playing a significant role in both the ground and air components of the counter-ISIL campaign, and beside whom you will shortly be fighting yourselves: France, Australia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Each of these nations has a significant stake in completing the destruction of this evil organization, and we must include all of the capabilities they can bring to the field.  And I will not hesitate to engage and challenge current and prospective members of the coalition to do more as we go forward. Next, let me describe the fight outside of Iraq and Syria. As we work to destroy the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas such as North Africa, Afghanistan, and Yemen. The threat posed by ISIL, and groups like it, is continually evolving, changing focus and shifting location. It requires from us, therefore, a flexible and nimble response with a broad reach. And that’s why the Defense Department is organizing a new way to leverage the security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe into a network to counter transnational and transregional threats like ISIL. From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain in October, to those I visited last month in Jalalabad, those regional nodes provide forward presence to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds. They enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent ISIL affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the parent tumor itself. This counterterrorism network is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership. An example of this network in action was our November 13th strike on Abu Nabil, where assets from several locations in the network converged to successfully kill this ISIL leader in Libya. As we destroy the parent tumor and disrupt its metastases, we are constantly mindful of our most important mission – protecting the homeland. The Department of Defense has a supporting  but very strong and active role to play within our borders, reinforcing law enforcement, homeland security, cyber defense, intelligence and more. And I’ll continue to coordinate with my counterparts at every agency to ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent an attack, including against our military facilities here at home. Beyond our shores we’re using all appropriate means at our disposal to disrupt potential attacks and hold accountable those who would do harm to Americans. After ISIL figures orchestrated an attack in Paris in November, President Obama vowed that we would hunt down the perpetrators. And on December 24th, our airstrikes killed Charaffe al Mouadan, a Syrian-based ISIL member with a direct link to the Paris attack cell leader. Two days later, another ISIL leader with ties to the Paris attack, Abdul Kader Hakim, was killed. Our government promised to pursue Jihadi John “to the gates of hell.”  And now he is dead. We’ve made it clear that those who threaten or incite harm to Americans, wherever they are, will surely come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice. Our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, at its source and wherever it rears its head, is far from over, but the outcome is not uncertain. There will be extraordinary challenges ahead, and as I will emphasize in Paris next week, we must all do more. But our campaign will continue to adapt and build on our success, as ISIL’s territory decreases, its resources dwindle, and local, capable forces gain the capacity to not only win on the field of battle, but to lay the foundation for lasting security in the region, and a more secure future for the world. And that’s why I am asking you to take on this challenge. The Iraqi and Peshmerga forces you will train, advise and assist have proven their determination, their resiliency, and increasingly, their capability. But they need you to continue building on that success, preparing them for the fight today and the long hard fight for their future. They need your skill. They need your experience. Often, they will need your patience. As you enter this complex environment and challenging mission, I’d like to leave you with two thoughts. One, I encourage you to bring fresh ideas and new perspectives to the fight. You will see things that we don’t see in Washington – and things that your commanders might not see. Opportunities that present themselves as the battlefield shifts, chances to evolve as our efforts open up new avenues and places where we can increase the pressure on ISIL. Tell your commanders, so they can tell me. We must maintain the tactical flexibility to take full advantage of these opportunities as they emerge, even as our basic strategy remains in place, and that depends on you. And, second, know that as you embark on this noble mission, our nation is 100 percent behind you. We know what you’re putting into this, what you’re sacrificing, and what you’ll achieve. Deploy to theater knowing that you're what I wake up for every day. Thank you and thank your families for your service. Good luck to all of you. Our blessings with you and your family as you prepare to deploy on this critical mission. Now I’d like to take the chance to look you each in the eye, shake your hand, and say that to you personally. Thank you.

"April 23, 2015","Thank you, President Hennessey, for that wonderful introduction.  And thanks to all of the colleagues – many colleagues and friends here at Stanford for the opportunity to be with you today.  It’s a special privilege for me to give the Sidney Drell Lecture, and I need to tell you why. I began my career – as John Hennessey indicated – in elementary particle physics, and the classic textbook in relativistic quantum field theory, which described the first of what are known as gauge field theories, namely, quantum electrodynamics, was entitled Bjorken and Drell, Relativistic Quantum Fields.  I’ve got my copy of Bjorken and Drell right here – it’s all marked up in the margins from those years ago. For my doctoral thesis in theoretical physics, I worked on quantum chromodynamics, it’s also a gauge theory – field theory of the force by which quarks are held together to make nucleons.  And at Oxford University’s department of theoretical physics, the external thesis advisor for my thesis was Sid Drell.  I talked to Sid Drell earlier in this morning, and he can’t be here today, but that’s my thesis back in the days when they were bound. When I visited the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in subsequent years as a post-doc, I remember sitting on the porch of the rambling ranch house right here on the Stanford campus that Sid and Harriet Drell lived in.  As post-docs tend to do, I would hang around their house at dinnertime hoping that Harriet would invite me in to dinner, which she usually did.  And sometimes their daughter Persis would be there, who is now, of course, the dean of engineering here at Stanford. A few years later, Sid was assisting the assembly of a team of scientists for the U.S. Congress on a topic that preoccupied Cold War Washington at the time:  how to base the ten-warhead MX intercontinental ballistic missile so that it could not be destroyed in a first strike by 3,000 equivalent megatons of Soviet throw-weight atop their SS-18 missile.  He recommended that I join that team temporarily.  Sid Drell was an inspiration to all those who worked in those years to control the danger of nuclear weapons.  And this – for me – was the beginning of my involvement in national security affairs. At about that time, I got to meet the then-Under Secretary of Defense in charge of technology and procurement for the Department of Defense.  He impressed me with how lucid and logical he was, and how well he applied technical thinking to national security problems.  That Under Secretary was of course William Perry, who is also present here today, and who later became Deputy Secretary of Defense and finally Secretary of Defense in a progression that I have followed some 30 years later.  Bill has been a major figure in my life, including standing in for my father at my wedding. So I thank both Sid and Bill Perry, and many, many other colleagues here at Stanford…old friends at CISAC, at the Freeman Spogli Institute, at the Hoover Institution, and in the engineering faculty.  I especially thank everyone for their warm welcome to me as a visitor here earlier this year.  Not quite two months into it, on a fateful Monday afternoon in November, though, duty called.  And I found myself nominated by President Obama to be Secretary of Defense. When I became Secretary, I made three commitments.  The first is to the troops and to their families – to safeguard them, to ensure that they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all to ensure that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care.  The second commitment is to President Obama – to offer him my best strategic advice as he faces a complex world, to ensure at the same time that he receives candid military advice, and finally that his decisions are carried out with DoD’s expected excellence.  And my third commitment is to the future – to stay ahead of a changing world, to stay competitive, to stay aware of new generations and attract them to our mission of serving the country, and to stay abreast of technology…all this the topic of my comments today. Over the years, I’ve seen lots of products developed here in Silicon Valley and throughout the tech community to enable boundless transformation, progress, opportunity and prosperity…across all sectors of our economy and society – commerce, health care, education, transportation, and national defense among many others.  And it’s made many things easier, cheaper, and safer. But in recent years, it’s become clear that these same advances and technologies also present a degree of risk to the businesses, governments, militaries, and individual people who rely on them every day…making it easier, cheaper, and safer to threaten them. The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb.  And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces – and they’re now available to the highest bidder.  Whether it’s the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs – our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. And this brings me to my question for today:  how do we mitigate that risk – the risk that comes with such technology while simultaneously unleashing its promise?  How do we protect not just the freedom the Internet affords and the new opportunities to advance human welfare that technology enables, but also our country, our future, our children, our people? And the key, in my mind, is to ensure an alignment between a defense that leverages our strengths – like our robust and independent business and academic communities – and that reflects our nation’s values and longstanding traditions…and a defense that is effective in a changing world.  How to align all that, and how we achieve that alignment isn’t new.  We find the alignment in open partnership…by working together. Indeed, history shows that we’ve succeeded in finding solutions to these kinds of tough questions when our commercial, civil, and government sectors worked together as partners.  And today, we must…and can…do the same. Looking out over the last 75 years, we’ve had a long history of partnership.  Sometimes the bonds between the academy, industry, and defense were particularly close…like during World War II, when the Manhattan Project and the MIT Radiation Laboratory and others brought together the brightest minds, and the best of industry cranked out the ships, planes, and tanks – at what are now astonishing to us numbers.  And another was during the Cold War, when a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts paved the way to a future of precision-guided munitions, battle networks, and stealth.  At times, we also eyed each other warily – like when Bobby Inman faced off against Martin Hellman and Whit Diffie over public-key encryption and commercialization; or during the controversy over the Clipper ship – chip – Clipper chip, excuse me, in the 1990s; and, more recently, after the actions of Edward Snowden. Through successes and strains, our ties have broadly endured…but I believe we must renew the bonds of trust and rebuild the bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley. One reason to do so is that we share many of the same underlying objectives and values.  As our government has demonstrated in recent trade negotiations, diplomacy, and decisions on net neutrality, we are strong proponents of a free and open Internet, and strong supporters of protecting intellectual property rights. But we also need to work together because we’re living in the same world, with the same basic trends and the same basic threats. The first of these trends is the evolutions we’re seeing in technology – that you all know very well about. But second, there’s been an evolution for us of where technology comes from.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in the United States, and much of that was sponsored by the government.  Now much more technology is commercial, and the technology base is global. Globalization and commercialization have, in turn, led to more competition, which is good, because it leads to more innovative thinking.  That’s driven a third trend, which is that the competition for talent has become much more aggressive – and I’ll have more to say about that later, because that matters a lot to me as Secretary of Defense. These trends are contributing to a growing problem we think about every day in DoD: the fact that threats to our security and our military’s technological superiority are proliferating and diversifying.  This is happening in terms of conventional weaponry and technologies, and in the cyber domain.  You may think that some of this should just be left up to DoD, but these challenges should concern us all. Let me step back.  During the Cold War, Bill Perry drove a so-called “offset strategy” that harnessed American technology to radically change warfare through precision-guided munitions, network-centric forces, and stealth aircraft.  It came to life during the 1991 Gulf War – when the world watched, stunned, at what the American military might had achieved.  But the world has since had a quarter century to figure out how to counter these capabilities. So now we’re seeing high-end military technologies long possessed by only the most advanced foes find their way into arsenals of both non-state actors and previously much less-capable militaries.  And nations like Russia and China have been pursuing long-term and comprehensive military modernization programs to close the technology gap with the United States…particularly through capabilities designed to thwart our traditional advantages of power projection and freedom of movement.  They’re developing and fielding new and advanced aircraft, submarines, and ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, and anti-air missiles that are both longer-range and more accurate.  And they’ve been working on new counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, undersea, and air attack capabilities that challenge our own.  And as I’ll explain more in a moment, we’re of course innovating to stay ahead of these threats…but they’re very real. And meanwhile, as tech companies see every day, the cyber threat against U.S. interests is increasing in severity and sophistication.  While the North Korean cyberattack on Sony was the most destructive on a U.S. entity so far, this threat affects us all.  And it comes from state and non-state actors alike.  Just as Russia and China have advanced cyber capabilities and strategies ranging from stealthy network penetration to intellectual property theft, criminal and terrorist networks are also increasing their cyber operations.  Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace.  We’re also seeing blended state-and-non-state threats in cyber…which complicates potential responses for us and for others. And this is a serious business.  This is a serious matter.  And it requires our collaboration.  But in addition to dangers, there are also really great opportunities to be seized through a new level of partnership between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley – opportunities that we can only realize together. Consider the historic role that DoD and government investments have played in helping spur ground-up technology innovation – both in this Valley, and on this campus.  Some examples are well known.  Vint Cerf ‘fathered’ the Internet while a Stanford assistant professor and also a researcher at DARPA.  GPS – I don’t know whether Jim Spilker is here – likewise began as a defense-driven project, as did, in an earlier era, jet engines and communications satellites.  And even today, Stanford continues to be among the top university recipients of federal R&D; spending. But other examples we hear less about.  Work on Google’s search algorithm was funded by a grant from the NSF, National Science Foundation.  And most technologies used throughout Silicon Valley – including many that Apple brilliantly integrated into the iPhone – can be traced back to government or DoD research and expenditures.  The developers of multi-touch worked together through a fellowship funded by the National Science Foundation and the CIA.  iOS’s Siri grew out of not only decades of DARPA-driven research on artificial intelligence and voice recognition, but also a specific DARPA project funded through SRI to help develop a virtual assistant for military personnel.  And Google’s self-driving cars grew out of the DARPA Grand Challenge. Now, obviously none of this diminishes the genius, the hard work, and the sacrifices by innovators here at Stanford, or in Mountain View, or Boston, or elsewhere.  The government helped ignite the spark, but this was the place that nurtured the flame that created incredible applications.  I mention this because it speaks to a partnership that has long existed between America’s technology sector and its government and defense institutions…a relationship that can continue in a way that benefits us both. All these facts – both the challenges and the opportunities – lead me to a clear conclusion.  Renewing, strengthening our partnership is the only way we can do this. Now, it won’t always be easy.  We’ve had tensions before, and we will likely have them again.  We shouldn’t diminish that.  But those who work in the tech community are no strangers to intense grappling with ideas.  And the same is true for those of us who work in the Pentagon.  And, because we have different missions and different perspectives, sometimes we’re going to disagree. But I think that’s okay.  Because being able to address tensions through our partnership is much better than not speaking at all.  And there can be great ideas that come out of candid conversation. And this of course leads us to a new question – what would this renewed partnership look like?  And what’s the best way to re-wire the Pentagon for a partnership? As Secretary of Defense, I believe that we in the Pentagon – to stay ahead – need to change and to change we need to be open, as I say, we have to think outside of our five-sided box.  So I want to spend the rest of these remarks talking about two areas where I believe our partnership is most vital – innovation more broadly and cybersecurity particularly.  And I want to be open with you about our plans for both. Let me start with innovation. It’s no secret that DoD is coming out of fighting two wars – two long wars – for more than 10 years.  While we were focused on solving the problems we faced during those wars, we lost sight, in some ways, of the bigger picture about the impact and proliferation of technology around the world. Now, this isn’t to say that DoD has completely ceded R&D; funding and innovative thinking to everyone else – we still make up half of federal research and development, which is about $72 billion dollars this year.  These are resources that help build the world’s most advanced fighters and bombers, develop new phased arrays for radar, and produce the satellites, missiles, and ships that let us strike terrorists in the Middle East and underwrite stability in the Asia-Pacific.  And unlike our R&D; investments during the past 14 years of war – like when we needed thousands of Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected vehicles, or MRAPs, to protect our troops from roadside bombs – the investments we’re making today are preparing us to face the types of high-end threats that I described earlier. Some of these R&D; funds – $12 billion dollars’ worth – support the breakthrough science and technology research done at universities and companies and DoD labs across the tech community.  For example, a number of folks here at Stanford have worked with DARPA, our advanced research projects agency, which you all know.  In the past three years, DARPA has partnered with nearly 50 different public- and private-sector research entities in Silicon Valley – that’s just one agency.  These relationships are really valuable to us, and I intend to continue to nurture them. Come June, we’ll see this in action, when the finals take place for the DARPA Robotics Challenge in Southern California.  This event will showcase how work on smaller sensors, pattern recognition technology, big data analysis, and autonomous systems with human decision support, could combine into a rescue robot – that’s the challenge – a rescue robot that navigates a disaster-stricken area with the same speed and efficiency that you or I would…but without putting anyone at risk. Another example is how we’re looking beyond GPS.  While DoD will of course continue to support the GPS satellites, which we engineer and launch – because of all the commercial applications as well as military applications – we also need to find alternatives for military use that are more resilient and less vulnerable.  We’ll do that in part by advancing microelectromechanical systems technology for small inertial navigation units, small accurate accelerometers, and precision clocks – all on a chip.  Today this technology is in our smartphones – that’s how they know they’re being rotated – and we’re pushing it to be far more precise.  We’ll push, for example, the performance envelope in timing and navigation technology by harnessing Nobel Prize-winning physics research that uses lasers to cool atoms.  Stanford has been a tremendous force in this area, with one group of researchers creating a company we work with, AOSense, to make practical cold-atom systems.  The result would be a GPS of things – akin to the Internet of things – where objects, including our military systems, keep track of their position, orientation, and time from the moment they are created with no need for updates from satellites. But to stay competitive and to stay ahead of threats, DoD must do even more.  And that starts with our people, who are our most important asset – both in Silicon Valley and in the military.  Who they are, and where they are, matters tremendously in affecting our ability to innovate.  And that’s the rationale behind some initial steps I’m taking starting today. First of all, it’s important that we at the Pentagon find new ways to help bring in new people with the talent and expertise we need, and who want to contribute to our mission as part of the force of the future, even if only for a time…or a project.  We’re establishing a DoD branch of the U.S. Digital Service, the outgrowth of the tech team that helped rescue healthcare.gov, for example, to help solve some of our most intractable IT and data problems in DoD.  And in fact, we have our very first team there – a ‘sprint team’ already in the Pentagon working on transferring electronic health records from DoD to the Veteran’s Administration – a bigger problem than you might imagine.  And they’ll work on classified projects as well.  And if you want to be a part of the U.S. Digital Service [Link], you can, and it’s a wonderful opportunity to try out public service – try out applying your skills to national defense and maybe you’ll end up like I did after Sid Drell got me to give it a try.  But that’s what we’re trying to do – ask people to give us a try, join us for a while – even if for just a time.  Make a contribution. Feel what it’s like to be a part of something that’s bigger than yourself.  And it really matters. The reason that Silicon Valley is so successful is that it has the right people in it but there’s proximity as well – there’s an ecosystem out here.  Everyone’s in the same general area, which not only helps forge relationships, but also helps spread new ideas.  And that geographic proximity, coupled with strong links between academia and industry, has made this entire region a nexus for innovation. So I am also creating something that we call the Defense Innovative Unit Experimental [Defense Innovation Unit X]…first-of-its-kind unit for us, staffed by some of our best active-duty and military personnel, plus key people from the Reserves who live here who are some our best technical talent.  Some of you are reservists – and we appreciate that.  They’ll strengthen existing relationships and build new ones; help scout for new technologies; and help function as a local interface for the department.  Down the road, they could help startups find new work to do with DoD. Third, we’re going to open a door in the other direction – from our best government technologies to industry and then back.  For example, we currently have a Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program that sends about 15 of our people a year out to commercial companies like Oracle, Cisco, FedEx, and others.  Right now we don’t effectively harness what they’ve learned when they come back. So we’re going to expand that fellows program into a two-year gig – one year in a company, and one year in a part of DoD with comparable business practices.  That way we have a better chance to bring the private-sector’s best practices back into the department.  These are just some of the examples of how we need to drill holes in the wall that I think exists and has built up over the years between the Department of Defense and the commercial and scientific sector.  Let people come back and forth and try it out – that’s the only way to do it.  People want choices these days, and they want mobility. They don’t want to get stuck on one side of the wall or the other. We also have to think about investing in the most promising emerging technologies, as well as our people.  While DoD has sought to continuously improve our acquisition processes over the past five years – and I’m proud to have been a part of that effort at the beginning of the Obama Administration – there are still areas where we can and must do better. One concern I’ve heard about is the worry that the government will insist on taking intellectual property, and then reveal proprietary information to the public and to competitors.  Let me assure you that we understand and appreciate industry’s right to intellectual property.  And DoD has a long history of successfully protecting companies’ proprietary information, and we respect the fact that IP is often the most important and valuable asset a company holds, and that businesses cannot be forced to sell their IP to the government.  We understand all that.  We need the creativity and innovation that comes from start-ups and small businesses, and we know that part of doing business with them involves protecting their intellectual property. This is particularly important because start-ups are the leading edge of commercial innovation, and right now, DoD researchers have many effective ways to transition promising – sorry, do not have enough effective ways to transition technologies that they come up with to application.  And we need to fix that, too.  I don’t want us to lose out on an innovative idea or capability we need because the Pentagon bureaucracy was too slow to fund something, or we weren’t amenable to working with startups, as we should be. So, borrowing on the success of the Intelligence Community’s partnership with the independent, nonprofit startup-backer In-Q-Tel, which many of us have had involvement with, I’m going to propose – I have proposed and they’ve accepted a pilot project with In-Q-Tel to provide innovative solutions to our most challenging problems.  We’ll make investments with In-Q-Tel in order to leverage their existing proven relationships, and apply their approach to DoD.  As some of you know, In-Q-Tel has been working with Silicon Valley for over 15 years, and continues to provide other parts of the U.S. government with access to the start-up world.  In order to regain our competiveness, we have to expand our ways of investing in identifying and implementing new technologies and capabilities – and this approach may help us yield a long-term advantage. And commercial technology – I should say – is not a panacea, nor will it ever be…we can’t get everything from outside, and we need some special technologies for our own special missions.  Stealth is one example: we need aircraft to look as tiny as sparrows on radar, but nobody else needs aircraft in the commercial world that do that.  Similarly, the Mach 5-plus hypersonic scramjet we tested on the X-51 a couple years ago is technology we need for a new dimension in warfighting – it’s not something the commercial sector needs. But there are many areas where the potential in leveraging commercially-driven technology is so huge, that we have to embrace it going forward. We want to partner with businesses on everything from autonomy to robotics to biomedical engineering; from power, energy, and propulsion to distributed systems, data science, and the Internet of things.  Because if we’re going to leverage these technologies to defend our country and help make a better world, the Department of Defense cannot do everything in all these areas alone.  We have to work with those outside. And the same is true, finally, with cybersecurity – we’re going to have to work together on this one. While we in DoD are an attractive target, the cyber threat is one we all face…as institutions, and as individuals.  Networks nationwide are scanned millions of times a day.  And as we’ve seen cyber attackers bombard the public websites of banks, make off with customer data from retailers, try to access critical infrastructure networks, and steal research and intellectual property from universities and businesses alike…so too have individual citizens been compelled to guard against identity theft. This is one of the world’s most complex challenges today, which is why the Department of Defense has three missions in the cyber domain.  The first is defending our own networks and weapons, because they’re critical to what we do every day…and they’re no good if they’ve been hacked.  Second, we help defend the nation against cyberattacks from abroad – especially if they would cause loss of life, property destruction, or significant foreign policy and economic consequences.  And our third mission is to provide offensive cyber options that, if directed by the President, can augment our other military systems. In some ways, what we’re doing about this threat is similar to what we do about more conventional threats.  We like to deter malicious action before it happens, and we like to be able to defend against incoming attacks – as well as pinpoint where an attack came from.  We’ve gotten better at that because of strong partnerships across the government, and because of private-sector security researchers like FireEye, Crowdstrike, HP – when they out a group of malicious cyber attackers, we take notice and share that information. Still, adversaries should know that our preference for deterrence and our defensive posture don’t diminish our willingness to use cyber options if necessary.  And when we do take action – defensive or otherwise, conventionally or in cyberspace – we operate under rules of engagement that comply with international and domestic law. This approach reflects two goals.  First, keeping the Internet open, secure, and prosperous.  And second, assuring that we continue to respect – and protect – the freedoms of expression, association, and privacy that reflect who we are as a nation. Let me repeat that second goal:  We must continue to respect, and protect, the freedoms of expression, association, and privacy that reflect who we are as a nation. To do this right, we again have to work together.  And as a military, we have to embrace openness.  Today dozens of militaries are developing cyber forces, and because stability depends on avoiding miscalculation that could lead to escalation, militaries must talk to each other and understand each other’s abilities.  And DoD must do its part to shed more light on cyber capabilities that have previously been developed in the shadows. So today, for example, I want to disclose a recent instance that helps illustrate the cyber threat we face today and what to do about it.  It’s never been publically reported, and it shows how rapidly DoD can detect, attribute, and expel an intruder from our military networks – in this case, unclassified ones. Earlier this year, the sensors that guard DoD’s unclassified networks detected Russian hackers accessing one of our networks.  They’d discovered an old vulnerability in one of our legacy networks that hadn’t been patched. While it’s worrisome they achieved some unauthorized access to our unclassified network, we quickly identified the compromise, and had a team of incident responders hunting down the intruders within 24 hours.  After learning valuable information about their tactics, we analyzed their network activity, associated it with Russia, and then quickly kicked them off the network, in a way that minimized their chances of returning. This episode illustrates a step in the right direction.  Like a lot of CEOs across the country, my primary goal in my enterprise is defending our networks because we, too, are a network-centric organization, but I still worry about what we don’t know.  Because this was only one attack that we found. One way we’re responding to that is by being more transparent, to raise awareness in both the public and the private sector.  Indeed, shining a bright light on such intrusions can eventually benefit us all – businesses and governments alike. More broadly, President Obama has said that we will respond to cyber-attacks in a manner and at a time and place of our choosing using appropriate instruments of U.S. power.  DoD has spent a lot of time figuring out how to help do so while also holding true to our nation’s enduring interests, traditions, and values.  And we’ve developed a new cyber strategy that details what our cyber missions are and when we will take certain actions and why. This new strategy – our first since 2011 – is to help guide development of DoD’s cyber forces, and it’s also a reflection of DoD being more open than before.  We’re making it available to the public today – both online [Link], and by the way, at the back of this room.  And I’d like to tell you a little bit about it. Like everything we do, our cyber strategy starts with our people – its first strategic goal is building and training our Cyber Mission Forces.  These are talented individuals who hunt down intruders, red-team our networks, and perform the forensics that help keep our systems secure.  And their skill and knowledge makes them much more valuable than the technology they use.  We’re just beginning to build and to imagine this cyber force in DoD. Another goal is to be better prepared to defend DoD information networks, secure our data, and mitigate cyber risks to military missions.  We do this in part through deterrence by denial, in line with today’s best-in-class cybersecurity practices – building a single security architecture that’s both more easily defendable, and able to adapt and evolve to mitigate both current and future cyber threats.  This to replace the hundreds of networks – separate networks – that we now operate in the Department of Defense.  We have to strengthen our network defense command and control to synchronize across thousands of these disparate networks, and conduct exercises in resiliency…so that if a cyberattack degrades our usual capabilities, we can still mobilize, deploy, and operate our forces in other domains – air, land, and sea – despite the attack.  And we’re also taking action – just this week I directed that we consolidate all of over IT services in DoD and throughout the Washington capital region – consolidate all of them, which will not only help improve our overall cybersecurity, but also save millions of dollars we can better spend elsewhere. Of course, as I’ve said, we know that working together in the cyber domain is essential.  And that’s why one of the primary aspects of our strategy is working with partners – in the private sector, across our government, and around the world.  And the strategy speaks to this as well. Because American businesses own, operate, and see approximately ninety percent of our national networks, the private sector must be a key partner.  The U.S. government has a unique suite of cyber tools and capabilities, but we need the private sector to take its own steps to protect its data and networks.  We want to help where we can, but if companies themselves don’t invest, our country’s collective cyber posture is weakened and our ability to augment that protection is limited. To build our vital cyber force, we’re going to need to use new ways to attract talent through new private-sector exchange programs that let people from outside contribute to our mission and then return here to the Valley or to stay, as I did.  And to ensure that our people have the right tools to execute their missions, we’re going to be increasing our fundamental research and development – this is an exception in these times of budget constraints – increase our fundamental research and development with both established and emerging private-sector partners in cyber…so that together, we can create cyber capabilities that not only help DoD, but can also spin off into the wider U.S. marketplace. And last to ensure our cyber operations are appropriate and effective, we’re going to work more closely with our law enforcement partners at the FBI, with Homeland Security, and elsewhere.  There are clear lines of authority in our government about who can work where, so as adversaries jump from foreign to U.S. networks, we need our coordination with our government to operate seamlessly.  And I’m determined that the Department of Defense be a cooperative partner with law enforcement and with homeland security.  We’ve already started practicing with them – just a couple of weeks ago, we had an exercise that we did with our FBI counterparts on how to do exactly what I said – and we’re going to be exercising much more going forward.  It’s important that we work together and that we all behave in a way that is lawful and appropriate. Now, as Secretary of Defense, my mission is to make sure our military can defend our country – make a better world.  But this is a mission that all of us who love freedom and opportunity and want a better for our children and our grandchildren share with us.  We’re our best when we have the best partners.  Knowing how we’ve worked together in the past, and how critical your work is to our country, strengthening this partnership is very important to me. We have a unique opportunity to build bridges and rebuild bridges and renew trust.  That’s why I’m visiting some other companies here this afternoon, and meeting with a group of tech leaders tomorrow.  I want to learn how, in the years to come, a new level of partnership can lead to great things. That’s what’s possible through partnership.  And whether it’s helping safeguard the Internet or helping save lives, working together for the greater good is bigger than who we are as individuals – bigger than who we are as companies. It’s an imperative we face…an opportunity we share…and it’s the only way to make a better world – together. Thank you.

"Sept. 21, 2016","Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you so much for being here and…to join me in what is a great privilege – and that is to honor Senators Carl Levin and John Warner today.  And also, I want to welcome Carl’s wife Barbara, his brother Congressman Sandy – where is…where’d Sandy go?  Ah, thank you, I know you have to leave early and tend to business on the Hill.  Budget business, I assume – budget business is good.  John’s wife Jeanne – Jeanne, thank you for being here.  John’s son John, his aptly named daughter Virginia, and his brother Charles – all to the Pentagon, thank you.  And I’m very glad to be joined by Jim Clapper, DoD leaders and Congressional leaders past and present, and so many long-time friends of all of us. We’re here today to honor two extraordinary senators and statesmen.  Now, Carl himself has called these two friends an “odd couple,” but what makes Carl and John different pales in comparison to all they share, including their uncompromising dedication to our nation’s defense and our men and women in uniform. For that commitment, for their leadership on the Senate Armed Service Committee, and for their continued support for DoD, we’re dedicating today the Levin-Warner Legislative Affairs Suite to them. And we’re also giving John our highest award, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.  Now, I’d liked to have awarded Carl that as well at the same time, but he’s so deserving he received that award a few years ago.  But John, as worthy as you and your service are, I was surprised you haven’t received it yet, but now, I’m honored to give you something that you so richly deserve. Now, it might seem odd to some of you that a Secretary of Defense would choose to honor two former members of Congress in this way.  But it shouldn’t seem strange – it shouldn’t seem strange.  And that’s because our defense is so vital that we must shepherd it from strategic era to strategic era, from administration to administration, from congress to congress, across parties, and across our government. And we have to do that together – following the example set by John and Carl.  They’re a model for bipartisan leadership on national defense and for partnership between branches of government.  They demonstrate an unwavering dedication to our personnel in uniform, on the battlefield and here at home.  And they are examples of civility in public debate and discourse. That last one is particularly important.  That’s because our troops need to be able to look up to their leaders here in Washington and see strength and consistency and respect, as well as a loyalty to – and caring for – them and our country’s future.  And they could always look up and see the two of you. The American people also need to be able to look to Congress and the Pentagon and be confident in the institutions dedicated to our national security.  And our friends and allies around the world need to see in Washington a commitment to the strength and to the principles that the United States has long represented.  And our foes need to see power and determination. Through their example and their leadership, Carl and John ushered us out of the Cold War and helped us address the opportunities and challenges of the post-9/11 world.  They also ably represented their states’ needs while considering the broader interests of our nation and our military. And that’s not always easy, but they took the long view when ensuring our nation’s defense.  And they appreciated how today’s challenges fall into the long arc of our nation’s history, and that there’s much to be gained by considering history’s lessons when developing today’s policies…and planning for our future. Their example is important today as the Defense Department today, right now, right here faces a new strategic era with no fewer than five major, immediate, and evolving challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it might metastasize around the world. As we confront these five challenges, I’m grateful – and we should all be grateful – that ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, there’s no one more capable…because our military edge is second-to-none.  That’s a fact that every American ought to be proud of, and a fact that every American should thank statesmen like Carl and John for.  In their years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, they sharpened our military edge and helped us stay ahead of our adversaries – ensuring that we were not only ready to address current threats and challenges, but also poised for future success. They did so because they wanted the best for our men and women in uniform.  They did so because they believed in our mission.  And they did so because they understood that no – no matter what tomorrow brings, the world will require sustained American leadership. And while we don’t get to choose the challenges we face today, we can prepare for tomorrow by setting a strategic course, establishing defense priorities, and making the right investments. Doing so requires cooperation and coordination across the government, but in particular, it requires a partnership between Congress and the DoD – and strong partnerships within Congress itself. Time and again, Carl and John were those kinds of partners, on smart and collaborative reform, with their measured and responsible oversight, and on the NDAA, which they helped pass on a bipartisan basis for over three decades and were matched – which were matched by corresponding appropriations.  As partners, as SASC chairmen, and as individual senators they helped make our department a better department and our military stronger. For his part, Carl was called “Mr. Integrity” when he was in the Senate.  Over his 36 years in the Capitol, he made a mark on domestic and foreign policy, but he’s best known in this building for his years on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  One Senator said of his leadership there, “Why can’t the rest of the Senate work the way the Armed Services Committee works?” He answered, the Senate – …that individual answered his own question and said that the Senate doesn’t have “enough Carl Levins.” Explaining why – on Carl’s retirement in 2014 – the SASC never let disagreements stop it from doing its business, current Chairman John McCain said simply, “Carl won’t let us.”  Indeed, every day he served, he always put our country – and our troops – first…right up until his last day in office.  He was even late to his own retirement party – I understand – because he was busy managing the NDAA on the Senate floor. A few years ago, Carl told some public policy students back home in his beloved state Michigan, that even “if issues change,” he said, “principles do not.”  Time and again, when the nation and DoD faced a new challenge, Carl was there…doing his homework, getting ground truth from war zones, providing the patience and persistence needed for principled oversight. As threats changed, Carl became a leading voice on counterterrorism.  As our missions changed and as technology, industry, and innovation evolved, Carl advocated for acquisition reform that benefited both our warfighters and our taxpayers.  And as times and the fights changed, Carl was always a tireless guardian for our troops and veterans, supporting their needs on and off the battlefield – repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” passing the Wounded Warrior Act, and getting body armor to troops in Iraq. Carl, for all this, your SASC leadership, your dogged work for our people, and your personal friendship, we honor you, and we thank you. And you had a good partner in John Warner.  As a member of the Greatest Generation and a native of Virginia, a state that has given our nation so many great leaders, Senator John Warner knows what it means to be a public servant: he served his country – in uniform, at the Pentagon, or on Capitol Hill – through every single conflict since World War II. During World War II, he enlisted as young sailor.  When the war in Korea broke out, he left law school to fight bravely as a Marine Corps officer.  During the Vietnam War, he led the Department of the Navy – first as an Undersecretary and later as Secretary. And from the Cold War to the first Gulf War to the Balkans and on to Iraq and Afghanistan, John served as a leading member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, including several years as chairman. On his time as chairman, John said, he saw his first responsibility as “towards my nation, not politics and particularly [to] the men and women of the armed forces and their families.”  That was clear in all he helped get done for our people and for our great institution. Thanks to his leadership, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines – and their families – can rely on TRICARE, the Goldwater-Nichols Act helped reform how our organization works, and the GI Bill was enhanced.  And he was an earlier – early champion for nuclear stability and safety, including the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, as the Cold War was coming to an end. Now, John may not remember this, but he and some of his colleagues invited me, who was a relative nobody in nuclear physics at that time, to a trip with them related to their work.  It was a fascinating time in history, but what I remember most in those years – many years ago now – is how John treated me and everyone around him. He was encouraging and respectful to me, a complete novice, and he was as respectful of me as he was of some of the national and international leaders with whom we met. That meant a great deal to one young person who was interested in public service, but it’s also a lesson that’s stayed with me throughout my career.  Some of the most important and profound connections we make in these positions happen far from the committee rooms and the Sunday shows, the bilateral meetings and the public eye.  Those moments of inspiration, John, usually only occur when one person is paying attention. John, as one person you inspired long ago and on behalf of the many others whom you have inspired then and inspire today, it’s my great honor to present the Distinguished Public Service Award to you today, which we’ll do in just a moment.  On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you, John.  Both in and out of uniform, you’ve dedicated your career – and your life – to serving this great nation. Now, in addition to honoring John and Carl’s remarkable careers, we’re also honoring the enduring friendship and partnership of these two men.  They traveled together, they talked together, and they passed the gavel to one another.  As they did so, they developed the trust and respect necessary to put the nation’s defense and our servicemembers’ welfare ahead of, as John has said, “all other considerations.” That’s why we’re naming the Pentagon’s legislative affairs suite after both of you and your partnership – a fitting tribute to two individuals who are examples for how we must work together – not only across the aisle but across the river to ensure the Defense Department and America’s military edge are not only ready to address current threats and challenges, but also positioned for success in the future. That’s what John and Carl did, regardless of the strategic era, regardless of the party in the majority, regardless of the politics of the day.  You can see that in footage from hearing after hearing, you can see that in all the miles they traveled together, and you can see that in the pages and pages of law these two have authored and passed. And you can also see that in a simple, yet powerful press conference just 15 years ago – almost to the day.  On September 11th, 2001 – a tragic day for sure in our nation’s history, and a particularly dark hour in the history of this very building and this department – they came here to the Pentagon.  They toured the damage, they comforted many, and they met with leaders here.  And they stood with Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld and Chairman Hugh Shelton in a Pentagon press conference to reassure the American people. And in that press conference Carl said, and I quote, “Our institutions are strong, and our unity is palpable.” John and Carl were two reasons why that was true on 9/11 and in the years since.  And with their names on the door – and their example front of mind – DoD’s legislative affairs team and senior leaders for years to come will work with our partners in Congress to ensure it remains true – and our military edge remains honed – in all the years ahead for this proud nation. Now we went by the newly named suite just a few moments ago – and I encourage you all to go there and look at some of the wonderful photographs now on display.  For now, though, we’re going to unveil a photo of the suite – right here – honoring these two distinguished servants. Once again, thank you, and congratulations, guys.

"Sept. 24, 2015","Good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, family, friends – and the men and women in uniform before us today who give meaning to this hallowed ceremony – thank you for being here to honor General Joe Dunford’s service as our 36th Commandant, and to welcome Bob Neller to his new post as 37th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. First and foremost, Ellyn: you’ve been Joe’s rock-solid foundation for more than three decades. Your support for our wounded warriors and our military families is more than dutiful – it’s personal. I see that all the time. Every family hosted at that magnificent Home of the Commandant leaves knowing the Dunfords are family, too. Ellyn was settling in, joyfully, to her duties as the Commandant’s wife, but the president and I had a different calling for her and Joe. And I’m grateful for her forbearance. My wife Stephanie, who also loves the troops, thanks you too. And you, Joseph, Pat, Kathleen have shared that warm support with countless others. To Joe’s parents – Mr. and Mrs. Dunford – thank you for your service, your sacrifice. Joe says he’s a Marine because of his dad, and he says he’s disciplined because of the “drill instructor” in the family…that’s you, mom. We can’t thank you all enough, now and into the future…because we’re not done with Joe yet. He was the first and obvious choice to lead our force as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs – and I speak for everyone when I say how fortunate we are that Joe’s counsel and wisdom will continue to guide our nation’s security for years to come. Today, we celebrate Joe’s leadership as Commandant – knowing it’s only a snapshot of what he’s meant to the Marine Corps. During the early years of the Iraq War, Joe commanded the 5th Marine Regiment. One Marine recalled that “every time there was a rough situation, Colonel Dunford was in his Humvee – out in front.” Another tells how Joe refused armor inserts in his flak jacket until every Marine under his command was issued a pair. Another Marine said just being around Joe was “awe-inspiring,” saying Joe is both, quote, “a brilliant tactician and the most humble individual I’ve ever known…he loves his men; and he’s loved by his men.” Perhaps the most telling testimonial came from an officer who served with Joe in 2003 and in the first Battle of Fallujah in 2004: “someday,” he said, “I will tell my grandkids that I was one of Joe Dunford’s Lieutenants.” These Marines’ say more than any of us could about the character and leadership of this great man. Humble. Driven to excellence. Always faithful to his people and mission…wielding [the] operational acuity of a battle hardened commander and the strategic wisdom of a statesman. We saw that – I saw that – clearly during Joe’s time leading U.S. and allied troops as the NATO ISAF Commander: we saw his compassion in handwritten condolences sent to families of the fallen…we saw his tenacity in the way he managed dealing with President Karzai…and we saw his skillfulness in transitioning security responsibility to Afghan Forces. During that time, and over the past 14 years, in two complex, all-consuming wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our Marines performed spectacularly. Today, the Marine Corps is at the center of a great strategic transition in our military: emerging from 15 years of counterinsurgency and strength in presence…to preparing for a full spectrum of threats, where we remain overwhelmingly strong in posture, not only in presence. In a way – that’s what Marines have always done. Answering the call across the full range of military operations. No one understands that better than Joe. And in his short but significant tenure, the Marine Corps has sharpened its air-ground task force capability, improved leadership development and care, and has remained the world’s pre-eminent expeditionary force-in-readiness … answering any call, anytime, anywhere on earth. Ebola in Africa. An earthquake in Nepal. An embassy evacuation in Yemen. Our counter-ISIL campaign in the Middle East. Our Marines are always there – keeping America, and the world, safer. To be ready, always – that’s what makes Marines, Marines. Joe Dunford has kept us on that path…and Bob Neller is the right person to carry us forward. I want to take a moment to thank D’Arcy, Kurt, Brett, Clare for their steadfast support through countless moves and deployments. Of course, we can’t forget Bob’s grandson, Conner…Is Conner here? Hi Conner – he is. I hear the only title Bob takes more seriously than General Neller is Grandpa Neller. Bob too is a tested warrior and an innovative strategist – never hesitating to act, always planning ahead. Like Bob says, “if we want to win, we can’t just show up.” I agree. Bob’s leadership will be help us stay ahead…in keeping our Marines the world’s unrivaled expeditionary rapid response force…and in building the Force of the Future, where we continue to be the best by attracting and retaining the best America has to offer. Because above all, it’s our people that make America’s the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Bob lives by that truth. During his J3 days Bob and I traveled together around the country and around theater. I got to know Bob and I saw many of the traits that suggested to me that he become our next Commandant. But I saw especially his greatest trait – the trait that compels him to serve and defines his character, and that’s his love for the troops...beneath that gruff exterior is a tender heart for the troops. Whenever he talks to them, whenever he talks to them, he lights up, and they light up too. On Bob’s right wrist, is a black cuff etched with the name “Eric R. Lueken,” a young Marine Corporal killed in Iraq in 2006. Bob says it reminds him every day to “be a General. Make a decision. Do something. Make it better.” As Commandant, that’s exactly what Bob will do. Because that’s what our Marines have done, and will continue to do… always proud, always ready, always faithful. To Ellyn, D’Arcy, Dunford and Neller families – and to the two patriots we honor here today – for your continued service and leadership, our country is grateful. Thank you.

"Sept. 26, 2016","Thank you.  Please sit down, guys.  Please sit down.  Great to be with you.  Look at what a fabulous, what a magnificent-looking crowd.  Really appreciate it.  And you know, hey, thank you Colonel Brooks.  And is Colonel Conner still here?  There you are – thank you.  Thanks, both of you, for hosting me. It’s great to be at Minot again.  For me, by the way, I’ll just tell you this right now, I first came here – and I’m embarrassed to say this because this is probably before some of you were even born, but – in 1983.  Long time ago.  So I’ve known this place for a long time, and more on that shortly, because it is a place of central importance to our security – past, present, and long into the future. I want to acknowledge also – very, very appreciatively – the presence here of North Dakota’s two senators here today, Senator Hoeven and Senator Heitkamp.  Thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  Appreciate it.  I know they need to go back to Washington shortly.  I’m sorry about that, but I do appreciate that as well because they’re going to keep our government going in the meantime, and that’s an essential thing for all of us.  But thank you.  Thanks for being here.  Much appreciated. And although they couldn’t be here today, I want to thank all the rest of the leadership of the Department of Defense that’s been out here – the Air Force, OSD, the Joint Staff and so forth. And also, I want to mention, though they’re not here today, my good friends and great colleagues, the Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz and the Deputy Secretary of Energy Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall – superb leaders of that department and essential partners of ours in the nuclear deterrence enterprise. And this week, I’m visiting a number of parts of the enterprise.  Tomorrow and Wednesday, I’ll be at Kirtland, and also at the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons laboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos.  But I wanted to start here, with the airmen of Minot’s 5th Bomb Wing and 91st Missile Wing, because of how much you, our people, matter to this mission, and how much this mission matters to our country. I know you’re only a few of the thousands of men and women, military and civilian, who contribute to the nuclear deterrence mission.  And while I’m saying this here to you at Minot, I want all of them to know in the nuclear enterprise – to the operators, to the enablers, to the maintainers, to the planners, to the communicators, to the security forces, the engineers and facilities personnel on DoD bases and installations; the scientists and engineers and technicians in the DoE weapons labs; and everyone else, including those in industry, who help keep our nuclear enterprise safe, secure, and effective – all day, every day.  We’re so grateful to all of them, all of you, for that. All together, you’re part of something vital, something special.  After all, there’s a lot that goes into this mission – because while deterrence may seem like a simple concept, even an elegant concept, it rests on a complicated, human-intensive and technology-intensive system. There are a lot of different pieces, starting with the hardware of the triad – the ICBMs, the bombers, and sea-launched ballistic missiles.  There’s also our fleet of dual-capable aircraft, those select fighter jets that extend a nuclear umbrella over our allies.  And then, just as critical, is the network of capabilities that enable nuclear command control, communications and intelligence – satellites, radar systems, ground stations, command posts, control nodes, communications links, and more.  These not only assure command and control, but also help provide us with integrated tactical warning and attack assessment. As you know, everyone has their role to play.  And while each physical piece is important it’s really the people who make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.  Together, all of this – all of you and all of these capabilities – comprise a system of systems that enables us to see what’s happening in the world, understand what it means, so we’re able to give the one person whom our nation has entrusted with this immense responsibility – our Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States, President Obama – with the best possible picture of information, so that he can make the most well-informed decision possible to keep our country safe, and so that we can carry out that decision with precision, excellence, and reliability. And the knowledge that every part of this enterprise is working as smoothly as it should be is, what makes you effective – for it’s that which deters.  The confidence that you’re ready to respond is what stops potential adversaries from using nuclear weapons against the United States or our allies in the first place.  It’s the whole point.  So everyone playing their part is tremendously important.  It’s a mission that demands unparalleled excellence – excellence that you define. We count on you for that:  America’s nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our security, and the highest priority mission of the Department of Defense.  Because while it’s a remarkable achievement that in the more than seven decades since 1945, nuclear weapons have not again been used in war, that’s not something we can ever take for granted.  And that’s why today, I want to talk to you about how we’re innovating and investing to sustain that bedrock. I realize it feels at times that most people don’t often think about your mission – which I know can be frustrating, even though in a way it’s a good thing, because it means you’re doing your job.  It’s a paradox that’s not easily reconciled, but one that I see and I understand.  Because whether they recognize it or not, our entire country, and more depends on you – since we’ve never found a perfect defense against nuclear weapons, only you can truly deter nuclear attacks that would result in enormous devastation. That’s one reason why you, and your mission, are never far from my mind – and you never have been, because I’ve been involved in nuclear deterrence issues for over 35 years.  In fact, I was telling the senators on the way out there what I just told you – 1983, first time I came here.  In fact, one of my first defense-related jobs was working on basing options for the MX missile – the one that became the Peacekeeper, and upon which the MK-12A sat – the same missile, that is, whose reentry system now sits atop the Minuteman III here. Today, you and your mission matter on so many levels. At a strategic level, of course, you deter large-scale nuclear attack against the United States and our allies.  You help convince potential adversaries that they can’t escalate their way out of a failed conventional aggression.  You assure allies that our extended deterrence guarantees are credible – enabling many of them to forgo developing nuclear weapons themselves, despite the tough strategic environment they find themselves in and the technological ease with which they could develop nuclear weapons.  And if deterrence fails, you provide the President with options to achieve U.S. and allied objectives – a responsibility that I know President Obama takes with the utmost seriousness, as do you – all to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons ever being used in the first place. And in a broader operational level and a more day-to-day basis, you enable American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines to accomplish their conventional missions around the world.  As you know, they’re standing with our NATO allies and standing up to Russia’s aggression in Europe, managing change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, deterring North Korea’s provocations, countering Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East, and helping accelerate ISIL’s certain and lasting defeat.  As they do, you give them confidence that a nuclear attack against our homeland is being deterred – confidence drawn in part from the vigilance you display every day. And for all Americans, and for that matter, all people all over the world, the bedrock of security you provide has enabled millions and millions to get up in the morning, to go to school, to go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give their children a better future. I know you’re all aware of how important this mission is.  And your leaders in Washington know it, too – not only me, but also the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Obama – you are all on all of our minds. That’s important, because in today’s security environment – one that’s dramatically different from the last generation, and certainly the generation before that – we face a nuclear landscape that continues to pose challenges, and that continues to evolve – in some ways less predictably than during the Cold War – even though many around the world, and even some in the United States, are stuck in the Cold War in their thinking. One way the nuclear landscape has changed:  we didn’t build new types of nuclear weapons or delivery systems for the last 25 years, but others did.  At the same time, in another part of the landscape, our allies in Asia, the Middle East, and NATO did not.  And so we must continue to sustain our deterrence. Now, Russia has long been a nuclear power, but Moscow’s recent saber-rattling and building of new nuclear weapons systems raises serious questions about its leader’s commitment to strategic stability, their regard for long-established abhorrence of using nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that Cold War-era leaders showed with respect to brandishing nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations underscore that a diverse and dynamic spectrum of nuclear threats still exists.  So our deterrence must be credible, and extended to our allies in the region.  It starts with the umbrella of deterrence you provide from Minot, supporting conventional forces like our air assets and our troops standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula to deter attack against our allies.  It’s also why we continue to build more robust ballistic missile defenses oriented toward the North Korean threat – deploying Ground-Based Interceptors in Alaska and California, and also agreeing with our Korean allies to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, in the Republic of Korea.  And we back all of that up with the commitment that any attack on America or our allies will not only be defeated, but that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective response. Russia and North Korea are just two countries – though very different ones – that stand out in this evolving nuclear landscape.  And there are others.  India, for example, has generally shown responsible behavior with its nuclear technology.  China also conducts itself professionally in the nuclear arena, despite growing its arsenal in both quality and quantity.  In Iran, their nuclear aspirations have been constrained and transparency over their activities increased by last year’s nuclear accord, which, as long as it continues to be implemented, will verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  And the last example I’ll cite is Pakistan, where nuclear weapons are entangled in a history of tension, and while they’re not a threat to the United States directly, we work with Pakistan to ensure stability. It’s also important to note where there are not nuclear weapons.  That is, where successful nuclear stability, stable alliances, and non-proliferation and arms control efforts – such as President Obama’s Nuclear Security Summits and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program that I worked on once upon a time in the 1990s – have prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, prevented dangers like loose nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union from becoming threats, and made the prospect of nuclear terrorism more remote, which is an agenda all great powers should embrace.  Because of these efforts, there are many places all around the world where nuclear weapons might have spread, but have not. Now, despite what has changed since the end of the Cold War, the nature of nuclear deterrence has not changed.  Even in 2016, deterrence still depends on perception – what potential adversaries see, and therefore believe, about our will and ability to act.  This means that as their perceptions shift, so must our strategy and our actions.  Indeed, how we deter cannot be static; rather, it must adapt as threats evolve, while continuing to preserve strategic stability – reinforcing nuclear restraint, rather than inviting competition or attack.  That’s important, because it illustrates how strong deterrence doesn’t lower the threshold for nuclear war – instead, it raises it. Today, however, it’s a sobering fact that the most likely use of nuclear weapons is not the massive ‘nuclear exchange’ of the classic Cold War-type, but rather the unwise resort to smaller but still unprecedentedly terrible attacks, for example by Russia or North Korea, to try to coerce a conventionally superior opponent to back off or abandon an ally during a crisis.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why we’re working with our allies in both regions to innovate and operate in new ways that sustain deterrence, and continue to preserve strategic stability. Across the Atlantic, we’re refreshing NATO’s nuclear playbook – to better integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence, to ensure we plan and train like we’d fight, and to deter Russia from thinking it can benefit from nuclear use in a conflict with NATO – from trying to “escalate to de-escalate,” as some there call it.  Now, obviously, we do not seek such a conflict to begin with; rather, we seek to prevent one.  And by having our dual-capable aircraft, B-61 bombs, and air-launched cruise missiles postured as credible response options – options intended to deter – we make limited use of nuclear weapons by others less likely. Meanwhile, across the Pacific, we engage in formal deterrence dialogues with our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea, to ensure we’re poised to address nuclear deterrence challenges in Asia.  And you should know that the work you do and the capabilities you provide are a common topic in these conversations, because they play a critical role in deterring a nuclear attack on these allies.  That’s also why our three countries together held a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise this past June – to continue sustaining deterrence. And here in the United States, we’re sustaining deterrence by taking steps to ensure that all three legs of our nuclear triad do not age into obsolescence.  This is part of our government’s policy, which President Obama made clear in Prague in 2009 when he said that, and I quote, “as long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies.”  That commitment was reiterated when the President released his 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, when he issued his 2013 Nuclear Employment Guidance, and it’s been reflected in every one of the defense budgets that the President has submitted to Congress over the last seven-and-a-half years – including his latest budget, for fiscal year 2017, which we announced in January – February. In this respect we’re now beginning the process of correcting decades of underinvestment in nuclear deterrence – and I do mean decades, because it dates back to the end of the Cold War, when funding for the nuclear enterprise dropped dramatically.  Over the last 25 years since then, we only made modest investments in basic sustainment and operations.  And it turned out that wasn’t enough, because ,as we now know too well, it meant that we had to rely unreasonably on talented people like you – and around DoD and the Department of Energy, for that matter – to help keep it going as it aged.  So that’s why we’re investing now not only to sustain the triad, but also to ensure you have the resources you need, the opportunities to advance your career, and the management structure and climate to empower you for success. For 2017, our budget invests a total of $19 billion in the nuclear enterprise.  That’s part of $108 billion we plan to invest over the next five years to sustain and recapitalize the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control communications and intelligence systems – ranging from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance to technological efforts that will help sustain our bomber fleet, and more. As you know, these investments reflect how we’re continuing to implement recommendations from the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Reviews, which recognize that our country had underinvested in an aging force.  As a result, we’ve invested about $10 billion over the last two years to make improvements.  Here at Minot, I know that’s most recently meant a newly repaired runway, expanded childcare options, and fitness centers open 24/7.  It’s created new assignment incentive pay and special assignment duty pay for military personnel.  It’s helped increase locality pay rates for civilians.  And, importantly, it reflects how we’re taking steps to replace the helicopters that help ensure that our ICBMs are secure. Additionally, the President’s budget also fully funds the first stages of our plans to ensure that the capabilities required to sustain nuclear deterrence don’t become obsolete.  This includes: replacing old ICBMs with new ones that will be less expensive to maintain; keeping our strategic bombers effective in the face of more advanced air defense systems, in part by replacing our aging air-launched cruise missile with a more effective long-range standoff weapon; replacing the F-16s in our dual-capable aircraft fleet with F-35s and the B61-12 gravity bomb; and building replacements for our Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. There are many reasons why this is important, and for that reason I’m confident the nation will make the right investments in the coming years. First, if we don’t replace these systems, quite simply they will age even more, and become unsafe, unreliable, and ineffective.  The fact is, most of our nuclear weapon delivery systems have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives.  So it’s not a choice between replacing these platforms or keeping them; it’s really a choice between replacing them or losing them.  That would mean losing confidence in our ability to deter, which we can’t afford in today’s volatile security environment. Second, while these investments are usually referred to simply as nuclear “modernization,” that’s only true in the sense of sustaining deterrence.  None of these investments is intended to change the nature of deterrence or how it works; after all, no one can do that.  And not only are they not intended to stimulate competition from anyone else; we know they aren’t having that effect, because the evidence is to the contrary.  After all, as I said earlier, we didn’t build anything new for the last 25 years, but others did – including Russia, North Korea, China, India, Pakistan, and, for a period of time, Iran – while our allies around the world – in Asia, the Middle East, and NATO – did not.  And our allies are not creating new types of nuclear weapons, either; that, some nations are unfortunately doing.  So this is about maintaining deterrence in a world very different from the Cold War – as older systems become less effective, we’re making sure we continue to preserve strategic stability. Doing this will cost money, of course, but most people don’t realize that funding for the nuclear enterprise, even then, is a relatively small percentage of total defense funding – and even as we replace aging platforms, we don’t expect that fact to change. In the end, though, this is about maintaining the bedrock of our security.  And after too many years of not investing enough, it’s an investment that we as a nation have to make, because it’s critical to sustaining nuclear deterrence in the 21st century. Of course, even as we invest to ensure this mission has the capabilities to succeed, we’ll also keep investing to ensure it has to people to succeed, and to make sure you succeed.  Because our deterrence isn’t credible unless we have the right people – people like you, people we know we can count on – who’re manning, equipping, operating, securing, and supporting our nuclear enterprise – and not only today, but in the future as well. Indeed, even as we all of course would wish to live in a world without nuclear weapons, it’s also true – something President Obama has noted many times – that we may not realize that goal within our lifetimes.  And unfortunately, given what we see in today’s security environment, it’s also likely that our children, and their children, will probably have to live in a world where nuclear weapons exist.  This means that what you do – ensuring safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrence for as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world – will continue to be important for the defense of our nation for a long time to come.  And it means that your career fields will continue to need to attract, and retain, the most talented men and women American will have to offer in future generations – people like you.  As you know, we don’t let just anybody do this job – and our force of the future, including our nuclear force of the future, will need people as excellent as you. That’s why I have something very important to ask of you and your fellow servicemembers who make up the nuclear enterprise and make it work:  that you keep carrying out your mission with the excellence our nation has long been able to count on from those entrusted with these weapons – excellence that is unparalleled.  In turn, we, as your leaders, will ensure you have the support and the systems you need to do so. I want to close by saying that you should be proud of what you do every day for our country – and do know how proud I am of you.  Because you’re doing one of the noblest things that a person can do with their life, which is to help defend our country and make a better world for our children.  And that’s what this enterprise is all about. When I was coming up as a physicist, the generation that trained me had worked on the Manhattan Project.  Their legacy was one of ensuring effective capabilities and credible deterrence, but never recklessness – always having immense respect for the tremendous power that nuclear weapons can unleash, and therefore having the determination to deter, so that they will never be used. As a young man, these were my mentors, and they helped me realize that I didn’t have to choose between strengthening nuclear deterrence or working toward a world where such deterrence would no longer be necessary – that instead, I could do both.  And ever since, even as I contributed to the advancement of weapons systems like the MX missile and other parts of our nuclear triad, I also participated in arms control efforts, non-proliferation initiatives, and helped lead the Nunn-Lugar program that secured nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union – Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus – preventing those potential dangers from becoming threats to our country, our world, and our fellow human beings. Today, you are the heirs to that great legacy that my generation inherited.  And it’s your task to not only uphold that legacy, but also to pass it on to those who will come after you. Your work here at Minot, your service, and your daily sacrifices – not to mention those of your families – are never lost on me.  And for what you do, and for the excellence and quiet professionalism with which you do it, you will forever have my, and our nation’s, profound gratitude. Thanks again. ","Remarks on ""Sustaining Nuclear Deterrence""",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/956630/remarks-on-sustaining-nuclear-deterrence/
"Jan. 18, 2017","Please don’t clap for me; I’m really here to clap for you.  That’s the theme of what I want to say to you, so good morning.  Thanks for being here. It was two weeks ago, I spoke of President Obama and his leadership and accomplishments as Commander-in-Chief.  And then last week General Dunford and the leadership honored me with farewells.  But, today I want to say farewell to you and to honor the department I’ve served and loved for 35 years and you that I have served alongside. Now, as many you know, I like to the walk the halls of this place, and also the roadsides to the dismay of people at installations around the country and around the world.  I walk cause I like to get a little exercise, I walk to get out of the office, and I walk around to see what’s going on in the department – and, most important, how all of you are doing and to say hello, and let me see you, and let you see me, and give you some sense of how important of what you do is, and how much I appreciate it. And over the course of three-and-a-half decades, I’ve seen how this department has changed has gotten better and better in many ways. I’ve seen how our missions have transformed – from the single minded and ultimately successful great power competition of the Cold War, which is where I began, to its relative easing in the decade thereafter, to the more than 10 years of skillful but all-absorbing counterinsurgency campaigns that followed, to today’s return to full-spectrum readiness and capabilities. And I’ve seen how our technology has evolved – when I started my career defense, and my career in physics for that matter, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.  Now, today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  So we’ve had to make sure we stay ahead, and stay the best. And I’ve seen how – as the Cold Warriors gave way to those who came after, and then the 9/11 generation was replaced by today’s force – our people have changed as well.  For starters, these halls are filled with a lot less cigarette smoke than was the case when I started.  But more than that, the whole force is higher quality, vastly more experienced, and draws high talent more widely from all of America than was the case back then.  And we’re better and stronger because of it.  And it’s our people after all and above all that makes ours the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Now, what hasn’t changed about this institution – and I don’t think will ever change – is why we’re all here.  What brought us here,  each and every one of you, of each and every one of the totality of the force nationwide, worldwide , is doing one of the noblest thing that a person can do with their life: that is defend this magnificent country and make a better world for our children. We get to do that, we have to do that.  But it’s a source of great pride and inspiration, and I think it’s the reason we’re all here. I’ve seen that commitment every day when I walked these halls, looking at all the extraordinary people here – uniformed and civilian, political and career, new PMFs and those who’ve served for decades like me – work together with determination to first of all confront the immediate challenges we face right now around the world—immediate, distinct, and evolving but upon us right now. I’ve seen it in those Americans standing with our allies and countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion in Europe – from soldiers at Grafenwoehr, sailors and Marines on the U.S.S. San Antonio in Estonia, airmen at Aviano, to civilians at NATO headquarters in Brussels. I’ve seen that dedication in all those Americans managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific and standing strong there too – on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Teddy Roosevelt afloat in the South China Sea, on our bases in Japan and the Republic of Korea, and elsewhere – flying, sailing, and operating wherever international law allows, and strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations. And I’ve seen it in those Americans serving on bases and aboard ships around the Middle East, whether in Kuwait, Bahrain, or other locations, where they’re deterring aggression, countering Iran’s malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and our allies. And I’ve seen it in the eyes of those warriors accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL – like those in Baghdad who received the first Operation Inherent Resolve campaign medals last April – who are enabling capable local forces to destroy ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria; and everywhere else it metastasizes: Afghanistan, Libya, and around the world; and also who are helping protect our homeland and our people, which after all, in the end, is what it’s all about. And I’ve seen that dedication here at home, at the Pentagon and in elsewhere.  In things that people here do: the briefs by strategists, planners, programmers, intelligence analysts, and more who are helping ensure we’re prepared for what will be an uncertain future, as well as a busy present, for challenges we may not even anticipate today.  In the meticulous work of those making sure we have the resources we need – even amid shameful budget uncertainty – to invest in the right training, the right equipment, the right force size, and the right compensation so that our people can always accomplish the mission and stay the best.  And in the care of those at our hospitals, outpatient support clinics, and wounded warrior facilities, those standing by the survivors of sexual assault, and against this offense against honor and trust, and those standing with the families of the fallen – who do all they can to take care of them and all our people.  And I’ve sensed it in all those who are making sure we always live the values that we defend and uphold the laws we’re sworn to protect. And I’ve read that dedication by all of you on every trip book and read-ahead I received from our remarkable teams here, every press release from our public affairs department explaining your work to the people we work for.  And I’ve heard it in the proposals and pitches—as they say—of all those thinking outside of our Pentagon’s five-sided box on our behalf– at DARPA, at dozens of DoD labs and research centers across the country, at our DIUx outposts, in the Defense Digital Service, on the Defense Innovation Board, other boards, and more – to ensure we always stay ahead of our competitors and stay on the cutting edge. And of course, I’ve also felt that commitment in all those across the department and in each of the services who are dedicated to building the Force of the Future for generations to come…so that we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer, military and civilian, for what is, after all, an all-volunteer force. And I hear that same dedication in the voices of all those who will make up and who will lead that Force of the Future.  In those the cadets and midshipmen I’ve visited with at the academies at West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs, in ROTC programs across the country.  In a phone call with the first women soldiers to graduate from Ranger School.  In conversations at boot camp at Great Lakes, and the Basic School at Quantico.  And the new recruits I administered the oath of enlistment to. They may be young, but they speak for all of us who’ve been drawn to this department and dedicated our lives to its mission.  Earlier this year, when I was visiting basic training, I went into the bunking area of some brand-new recruits.  Each stood rigidly in front of their bunk at attention.  It wasn’t obvious that they really knew who I was or what the Secretary of Defense was…but they looked terrified just the same. And as always, I went up to one of them and I said, “Why did you join us?”  He was 18 years old, with a little stubble of a moustache and kind of alarmed eyes…but without hesitation he said, “My parents always told me America gave us much and I should give back.”  Just like that, and then he started to cry, right there in front of 50 bunkmates.  I’m sure he got a lot of ribbing for that.  But that young person is an example of the kind of kid we get. And I’m sure that reason, that calling, that spoke to him speaks to many of you – as it does to me.  It’s what brought me to this place 35 years ago and kept bringing me back.  It is what brings you here every day and keeps you here through the long days and late nights, when you’re far from home or locked in a SCIF, holidays and sometimes weeks on end.  And it’s what drives the 3 million Americans serving, in uniform and as civilians, across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain –air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace. All of them – and all of you – are defending not only the United States and its people; you’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while you provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life.  Because you do so, and as you work sometimes late into the night, millions of Americans can go home that night to their families tonight in safety.  Because of what you do, our fellow citizens can live their lives and dream their dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought.  And because you do so, I’ll walk out of the Pentagon tomorrow, as I have every night of my tenure, confident in the nation’s – and this department’s – future.  And the brightness of that future. As all of you know, our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of you, for what you do every day and what you’ve done for us.  And I’m going to continue to be proud in the months and years ahead, as this department continues to live up to the incredibly high expectations Americans have for it and that it’s earned. May God bless you, God bless the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and God bless our great country.

"June 17, 2015","Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, all Members of the Committee:  thank you for inviting me here today.  Thank you also for keeping a wide-ranging and long-term perspective on the challenges and opportunities for America and its leadership around the world.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I was in Singapore, Vietnam, and India, and next week I’ll be in Germany, Estonia, and Belgium, for a NATO ministerial.  I understand that your focus in this hearing is current developments in the Middle East, and I’d be happy to answer questions about anything else. The Middle East, as the Chairman noted, is undergoing a period of great social and political turmoil with a number and variety of cross-cutting geopolitical developments.  Our strategy in the region, America’s strategy, is grounded in America’s core national interests – that’s the foundation – tailored to address specific circumstances in specific and various places – Iraq, Syria, Iran, and so forth.  And it leverages American leadership with the efforts of coalition – of a coalition of allies and partners. Our core interests, for example, drive our actions to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  Similarly, they dictate that we not let up until we have destroyed ISIL and al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists throughout the region that pose dangers to … Similarly, our core interests dictate that we not let up until we have destroyed ISIL and al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists throughout the region that pose dangers to the homeland, to friends, and to allies.  The past few weeks serve as a reminder to terrorists bent on harming the United States and our interests, whether they’re in Libya, Syria, or Yemen, that we have the capability to reach out and strike them. Meanwhile, the security of Israel will always be one of my top priorities – and the Chairman [of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] just returned from Israel this past weekend. And we’ll continue to hone important security relationships with our partners in the Gulf, bolster their security, and ensure freedom of navigation there. The pursuit of our nation’s core interests in the region is a strategy based on tireless diplomacy backed by formidable military power and dedicated capacity building to buttress and leverage the contributions of others, and especially, as noted, those in the region themselves. That’s why we have 35,000 forces postured throughout the region, enabling us to strike ISIL and al-Qaeda terrorists and check Iranian malign influence. That’s why we’re assuring Israel’s continued qualitative military edge, and why we’re working with our Gulf partners to make them more capable of defending themselves against external aggression. That’s why we’re supporting Saudi Arabia in protecting its territory and people from Houthi attacks, and supporting international efforts to prevent Iranian shipments of lethal equipment from reaching Houthi and Saleh-affiliated forces in Yemen. And that’s why the United States is supporting efforts to pursue political settlements to crises throughout the region, from Yemen to Libya to Syria. While I’m prepared for a range of questions related to DoD’s role in the Middle East, I’d like to focus on the immediate issue that I understand the Committee is interested in – namely, the U.S.-led coalition’s strategy to defeat ISIL. ISIL presents a grave threat to our friends and allies in the Middle East; elsewhere around the world from Africa and Europe to parts of Asia because of its steady metastasis; and to our homeland because of its avowed intentions to strike and recruit in this country.  ISIL must be – and will be – dealt a lasting defeat. The strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL constructed by President Obama draws upon all the national security agencies of the U.S. government:  intelligence, law enforcement, diplomacy, and others.  The strategy and its associated military campaign also involve a global coalition, reflecting both the world-wide consensus on the need to counter this threat and the practical requirement for others to do their part.  And the counter-ISIL strategy has nine – nine so-called lines of effort, reflecting the breadth of this challenge and the tools needed to combat it. The first and most critical line of effort is the political one, which is led by the State Department.  In Iraq, this involves building more effective, inclusive, and multi-sectarian governance.  Each of the other lines of effort requires success in this line because it’s the only way to create support among local forces – and local people – that support being necessary to make progress against extremism stick. The next two lines of effort are interconnected – to deny ISIL safe haven, and to build partnership capacity in Iraq and Syria.  Both are led by the Department of Defense, which, alongside coalition partners, is conducting a bombing campaign from the air, advising and assisting Iraqi security forces on the ground, and training and equipping trusted local forces. I will address our military’s current execution of these two lines of effort in a moment, but I want to underscore a crucial point about our campaign in Iraq and also Syria:  it requires capable, motivated, legitimate, local ground forces to seize, clear, and hold terrain – that’s the only way to ensure a truly lasting, enduring defeat of this movement. The fourth line of effort is enhancing intelligence collection on ISIL, which is led by the National Counterterrorism Center.  The fifth line of effort, which is disrupting ISIL’s finances – a vital task – is co-led by Treasury and State.  Lines of effort six and seven, both co-led by State and the National Counterterrorism Center, are to counter ISIL’s messaging and to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters to and from ISIL, both of which are critical in today’s connected and networked world.  The eighth line of effort, providing humanitarian support to those displaced by or vulnerable to ISIL, is led by State.  And finally, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are working together to protect the homeland – the ninth so-called line of effort – by disrupting terrorist threats here.  The effective execution of all nine of these lines of effort by the United States and its coalition partners is plainly necessary to ensure overall success. Let me turn to the execution of DoD’s two lines of effort, beginning with the U.S.-led campaign of air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.  This effort has produced some clear results – in limiting ISIL’s freedom of movement, constraining its ability to reinforce its fighters, and impeding its command and control.  It has enabled some key achievements for local forces –including the very recent success of anti-ISIL forces who took the key town of Tal Abyad.  The strikes are also buying critical time and space to carry out DoD’s second line of effort, which is developing the capacity and capabilities of legitimate local ground forces. The ground campaign is a work in progress.  The Iraqi Security Forces were severely degraded after Mosul fell last June, when four divisions dissolved.  The combination of disunity, deserters, and so-called ghost soldiers – who are paid on the books but don’t show up or don’t exist – had greatly diminished their capacity. However, understanding these challenges does not change reality – ISIL’s lasting defeat still requires local forces to fight and prevail on the ground.  We can and will continue to develop and enable such local forces, because we know from experience that putting U.S. combat troops on the ground as a substitute for local forces will not produce enduring results.  That’s why DoD seeks to bolter – bolster Iraq’s security forces to be capable of winning back, and then defending and holding the ISIL-controlled portions of the Iraqi state. What we saw in Ramadi last month was deeply disappointing, and illustrated the importance of a capable and motivated Iraqi ground force.  In the days that followed, all of us on the President’s national security team, at his direction, took another hard look at our campaign across all nine lines of effort.  At DoD, I convened my team before, during, and after my trip to the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean region to examine our execution of DoD’s lines of effort, and prepare options for the President if his approval was required for any enhancements we identified. In our meetings at both the White House and the Pentagon, we determined that while we have the right strategic framework, execution of the campaign can and should be strengthened, especially on the ground. We determined that our training efforts could be enhanced and thus are now focusing on increasing participation in and throughput of our training efforts, working closely with the Iraqi government and stressing the focus on drawing in Sunni forces, which as noted are underrepresented in the Iraqi Security Forces today. We also determined that our equipping of the Iraqi Security Forces had proceeded too slowly.  This process was earlier sometimes delayed by bureaucracy in Baghdad, but also in Washington.  That’s why we’re now expediting delivery of essential equipment and materiel, like anti-tank capabilities and counter-IED equipment, to the Iraqi Security Forces – including Kurdish and Sunni tribal forces. We also determined that we could enable Iraqi Security Forces with more tailored advice and assistance, including with critical outreach to Sunni communities.  That’s why, on advice from Chairman Dempsey and General Austin, and at my recommendation, last week President Obama authorized the deployment of 450 personnel to Iraq’s Taqqadum military base in Anbar Province to establish an additional site where we could advise and assist the Iraqi Security Forces. Situated between Ramadi and Fallujah, Taqqadum is a key location for engaging Sunni tribes, and Prime Minister Abadi, Iraqi military officials, and Sunni leaders have all committed to using Taqqadum to reinvigorate and expedite the recruitment of Sunni fighters.  Our forces will also provide much-needed operational advice and planning support to the Iraqi Security Forces’ Anbar Operations Center, which is also located at Taqqadum.  We expect that this move will open a new dimension in our and Iraq’s efforts to recruit Sunnis into the fight, and to help the Iraqis coordinate and plan the critical effort to roll back ISIL in Anbar province. And Secretary Kerry and I have agreed to begin a process of continually assessing execution of our campaign, starting with improving coordination across our respective lines of effort. Execution, however, is a two-way street, and our training efforts in Iraq have thus far been slowed by a lack of trainees – we simply haven’t received enough recruits.  Of the 24,000 Iraqi Security Forces we had originally envisioned training at our four sites by this fall, we’ve only received enough recruits to be able to train about 7,000, in addition to 2,000 Counterterrorism Service personnel.  As I’ve told Iraqi leaders, while the United States is open to supporting Iraq more than we already are, we must see a greater commitment from all parts of the Iraqi government. There are positive signs.  I’ve met with Prime Minister Abadi, Iraqi Kurdistan Regional President Barzani, and just last week with Speaker Jabouri of Iraq’s parliament.  They all fully understand the need to empower more localized, multi-sectarian Iraqi security forces and address persistent organizational and leadership failures. And because a sovereign, multi-sectarian Iraq is more likely to ensure a lasting defeat of ISIL, the United States must continue working with and through the Iraqi government in all our actions – including our support for Kurdish and Sunni tribal forces.  Our efforts need to reinforce inclusivity and multi-sectarianism, not fuel a reversal to sectarianism which would make the lasting defeat of ISIL harder, not easier. The situation in Syria is even more complex, because of the lack of a legitimate government partner, and many competing forces there.  Regardless, we will continue striking ISIL in Syria with the long reach of our airstrikes and operators.  We will continue working with Syria’s neighbors to impede the flow of foreign fighters into and out of Syria and Iraq.  Our train-and-equip mission in Syria has been challenging, but the requirement for a capable and motivated counter-ISIL ground force there also means we must persist in our efforts. In conclusion, I believe that success in this campaign can and must be assured.  It will take time, and require consistent effort on everyone’s part – the entire U.S. government, our entire international coalition, and most importantly, the Iraqi and Syrian peoples.  Together, and with your support – including your support for America’s troops and their families, for which I, and they, are ever grateful – we will achieve ISIL’s lasting defeat. I’d be happy to address your questions.

"Aug. 26, 2016","Thanks very much, Jonathan – for being here, for spending your time here, and you obviously get it, you get why we’re here and what this occasion is about.  So also does the chaplain – I appreciate that invocation rendered in that distinctive Missouri accent.  And Paul, his wife, thank you.  And to everybody in this organization, it’s great to be with you all – leaders here from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve; our Guard members and Reservists, their families, friends; previous award recipients; DoD personnel past and present; and our special guest, Lee Greenwood – thank you all for joining us. I’m glad to see so many Guard and Reserve members here.  And to just repeat what Jonathan already said, we thank you for what you’re doing for our country – more on that in general in a moment.  And I know many of their families and employers are here as well – and to each of you, family members and employers also, we’re grateful for what you do for our  Guard and our Reserve, our members, and the mission that they perform for our country. For more than 40 years, in fact, ESGR – yes, that is the acronym, Jonathan – has encouraged and worked with employers around the country to strengthen their support for their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve.  And our entire country is stronger for it. We see that in the awesome performance of our Guard and Reserve, especially, particularly over the last 15 years. We see it in the more than 4,500 ESGR volunteers nationwide who donate their time to this important cause and to ensuring that our Guardsmen and Reservists not only retain their current jobs, but find new ones. We’ve seen it in Louisiana just over the last two weeks, where over 3,500 Guardsmen have been responding to unprecedented flooding – helping rescue thousands of people, providing meals, and bottles of water, cots, blankets, tarps, sandbags, more. And we see it in this ceremony – when our community gathers again to present this Employer Support Freedom Award, which is the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to civilian employers for their support of our Guard and Reserve members and their families. And today, we award no fewer than 15 truly deserving employers.  These 15 are helping make DoD and our country stronger.  But for a moment, I want to focus on another number: the more than 2,400 nominations submitted by Guardsmen and Reservists who felt that their employer deserved recognition for all they do to support the Guard and Reserve. Think about what those 2,400 nominations mean.  They reflect the breadth and the depth of what our nation’s employers – large or small, public or private, recognized or not – do for our Guard and Reserve members, and therefore for the mission of the Guard and Reserve.  Those nominations represent all the bosses, all the supervisors across America who go the extra mile to help their employees serve the country.  The coworkers who are getting the backs of their colleagues and their families as they serve.  The HR departments that are making their organization a more attractive place to work for citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines – because also they know that hiring, and taking good care of, and retaining these Americans is not only the patriotic thing to do, but the smart thing to do for their businesses because of the tremendous ability of the people who make ours the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And we have many of these servicemembers here today.  Each of you and your colleagues across the country and around the world have my thanks.  You help keep our most solemn commitment as a military, which is to provide for our fellow citizens the security they need to live their lives, to dream their dreams, to give their children a better future – even if that means sometimes having to put your own lives on hold, or even at risk. Many of you have responded when we needed you most – perhaps never more so than over the last 15 years.  Indeed, since 9/11, more than 770,000 of our Guard and Reserve personnel deployed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sometimes – many times – more than once.  As their service in both those countries demonstrates, the Guard and Reserves are a critical component of our total force – a vital operational reserve that brings to bear the experience and skills of our citizen-warriors, wherever and whenever they’re needed to confront the challenges of a complex world. And a complex world it is, and today our nation, our great nation, with its global responsibilities, with its global opportunities and global interests, have no fewer than five immediate, major, evolving challenges:  first, countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, where half of humanity lives and half of the economic activity in the world resides, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and confronting terrorism, including especially accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere around the world to which it metastasizes.  And as history has shown, we also have to be flexible and agile in preparing to contend with whatever comes in the future.  The future’s uncertain; we can’t anticipate everything we may need to do.  We need to keep our game up. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines of our Guard and Reserve are right now helping ensure we meet those challenges – but as the nominations for this award demonstrate, they don’t have to do it alone. After all, their families serve, too.  That’s something today’s honored employers know – employers and employees – know very well.  And thanks to their employers, and many more across the country, Guard and Reserve members have been able to count on additional care and support for their families, particularly when they’re on duty or on deployment. That’s important, because personal families and, as these awardees will demonstrate, our servicemembers’ work families, too, are the foundation of our force.  Thanks to employers like the ones we’re recognizing today, our Guardsmen and Reservists can have the flexibility and the training they need to accomplish their mission.  They’re able to have the time off before and after deployment.  And they have a job to go back to when they come home. Some of our employers – especially the 15 we honor today – go above and beyond that level of support.  One, for example, shipped 2,000 pounds of household goods for their Reservist employee, which is fitting.  Another employer heard that his National Guard employee – who already been deployed for eight months – would need to be out for six more months to heal from a deployment injury, and so he offered to pay the Guardsman’s college expenses.  And one other employer got really creative – this is workplace flexibility taken to a high level – he joined his employees in warrior yoga sessions – but with a serious purpose, which is to help people who were returning from deployment who were having some stress, and this was an important way for them to relieve it. So these are just a few examples of all the awardees have done for our men and women in uniform.  And you don’t have to take my word for it.  One Guardsman, when nominating an employer we’re honoring today, said that the company he works for set the standard that all companies should abide by.  That’s why we’re giving out each of these awards today – because these organizations are leading, setting the standard for employer support for our Guard and Reserve. That leadership also helps bring the country together.  We live at a time when less than 1 percent of our population serves in uniform, which means fewer people are connected to those who do.  So we need to keep building bridges to our fellow citizens and communities who aren’t as connected to those who serve and sacrifice on their behalf as they once were.  Our Guard and Reserve, and their employers – especially our awardees – build those bridges every day. So on behalf of the entire country and the men and women of the Department of Defense, I thank you all for doing so.  And I congratulate today’s awardees.  Today, more than ever, the commitment they’ve shown to our country, and to those who serve our country, is indispensable.  To meet the challenges and opportunities we face as a nation and as a Department of Defense, we need each of you – all our Guard and Reserve, all our families, all our employers. Thank you, each of you, and congratulations to our awardees.

"Sept. 16, 2016","Good morning everyone. Senator Cornyn, Vice Chairman Selva, Captain Coffee, distinguished guests, families and friends: thanks for joining us here today. We gather here together today to recognize our nation’s former prisoners of war and those still missing…and to recommit ourselves to fulfilling our solemn pledge: to make every effort to bring all – all – our men and women home to their families. We’re honored to be joined today by former POWs, individuals who endured captivity courageously and honorably during World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam.  People like Captain Gerald Coffee, who never gave up during seven long years as a POW in Vietnam. Thanks, Captain Coffee…and thank you all – to all of you here who have served and endured captivity as you have. And we’re also privileged to be joined by family members of those still missing and former POWs.  Senator John Cornyn will speak in a moment – his father, then-Second Lieutenant T.J. Cornyn, was shot down and captured as a POW in World War II before being liberated.  Senator, thank you for being here, and thank you also for your commitment to those who serve today…not only in the past – right up until this day, including very recently when you visited our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It means a great deal to us Senator, thank you. And to all the families here today and around the world – whether you’ve been reunited or are still waiting for your loved one – thank you for your patriotism and courage in the face of uncertainty, and thank you for all you’ve given to this country. Since we came together last year on POW/MIA Recognition Day, we’ve accounted for over 135 missing servicemembers.  Missing personnel like Navy Lieutenant Julian Jordan, who served on the U.S.S. Oklahoma at Pearl Harbor that fateful December day 75 years ago.  For decades, Lieutenant Jordan’s remains were among the many – too many – listed as non-recoverable.  But a renewed Defense Department effort to identify unknowns in 2015 led to the successful identification of his remains…and his burial with full military honors in Washington State just last month. Like Lieutenant Jordan’s story, every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, and DoD civilian accounted for is a promise met, and we won’t stop – I won’t stop – until we achieve the fullest possible accounting for all our missing.  And right now, far too many families still have to wonder about the fates of their fathers, grandfathers, their husbands and daughters, their brothers and sisters. We work hard to meet our commitment to yesterday’s personnel to honor their service and their families.  But there’s another reason we do so: we know what it means to the men and women serving today, those who will serve in the future, and their families.  As they see everything we’re doing to provide the fullest possible accounting of those who served before… they know we’ll do the same for them. Indeed, one of the reasons our servicemembers will stop at nothing to accomplish their missions – whether they’re standing with our allies and standing up to Russia’s aggression in Europe, making – managing change in the vital Asia-Pacific, deterring North Korea’s provocations, countering Iran’s malign activities, or helping accelerate ISIL’s lasting defeat, which we will surely achieve – is that they know we’ll stop at nothing, and make every effort, to bring them home to their families. That’s a promise we make not only to our force of the past, but also our force today and of the future.  That’s why this commitment is so important.  And that’s why we’re so fortunate to have a lot of help keeping it. Committed family advocacy groups, veterans service organizations, and other non-governmental groups support our work.  Friends and allies around the world serve as critical partners in helping us reach, account for, and bring home our fallen.  And the men and women of DPAA – the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency – work day in and day out, in remote field sites and high-tech laboratories alike, across the United States and around the world, to meet that promise and to give hope and solace to our families. Today, we can meet our sacred commitment…to the force of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  So thank you for your partnership, thank you Captain Coffee and Senator Cornyn for sharing your stories with us, and thank all of you for joining us to commemorate our POW/MIA Recognition Day.  May God bless you, and may God bless this great nation in the years to come.

"July 31, 2015","Good afternoon. Fifty-one years ago today, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Enterprise and two other Navy ships embarked on a 65-day, 30,000-mile voyage circumnavigating the globe – the first by an all-nuclear-powered surface fleet. It was memorialized in an iconic photo of the Enterprise’s flight deck, with an array of fighter jets fore and aft flanking the crew, who stood in formation spelling out, “E=MC2.” Now, having taught theoretical physics, I’m going to resist the temptation to explain what that means…but for those of you who remember, that photo went everywhere – it went viral before viral was a thing. One place it appeared was the cover of National Geographic, a copy of which wound up in the hands of a nine-year-old boy in Norfolk, Virginia. And, as he would recall years later, when he picked up that magazine and saw the cover, he thought to himself, “how cool is that?” So began the journey we celebrate today,  a career in which that nine-year-old grew up to be a top naval aviator, went on to command that very same aircraft carrier – how cool is that? – and ultimately rose to the highest levels of America’s Armed Forces. So ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, leaders of the Defense Department past and present, colleagues from the White House, President’s Chief of Staff: thank you for helping us honor America’s ninth Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral James “Sandy” Winnefeld, Jr. I want to take a moment to recognize Sandy’s family here this afternoon – as the Chairman’s already done – starting with his dad, retired Rear Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Sr. Sir, Mrs. Winnefeld, Judy, ma’am, I can only imagine how proud you are today. Admiral Winnefeld, thank you for serving not only your country, but also serving as an inspiration to your son. You see, the Navy is a family business for the Winnefelds. Sandy’s oldest son, L.J., is a Midshipman at Annapolis – you’ll hear from him in a moment. If we’re lucky, it won’t be long before his brother Jon, a standout high school pitcher like his dad – no pressure, there, Jon – joins the Navy too. Or perhaps he’ll throw a curveball, and go Army. Then, there’s Sandy’s wife Mary. She’s been at his side for decades. After meeting at Miramar – and, as one more Top Gun thing– they never lost that lovin’ feelin’. And if you know Mary, you know she’s a force of her own – constantly working with military families, wounded warriors, survivors, and veterans. She’s at Walter Reed so much, they call her “Aunt Mary” there. So Mary, L.J., Jon, today we also thank you – for the love and support you’ve given Sandy, and for your service to our country. Now, over 37 years, Sandy has served just about everywhere – from the cockpits of F-14s, to the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise, to NORAD and NORTHCOM’s headquarters in Colorado. And as Vice Chairman, he really made his mark. For the last four years, he’s challenged a lot of institutional assumptions – strategically, technically, conceptually. He’s helped DoD build trust around the interagency. He’s been the grease in the machinery between our special operations forces and our most senior decision makers, helping remove some of the worst terrorists from the fight. And he’s worked immensely hard to improve our cyber security, our nuclear deterrent, and our space capabilities. Sandy’s mind is so wide and so deep that it dominates an astonishing range of issues – the budget, operations, missile defense, you name it – instantly grasping and analyzing even the most complex of problems. I’ve been fortunate to see it up close these past, now, six years. Beginning when Sandy was J5 and I was Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, then working closely together as Vice Chairman and Deputy Secretary – which is a close and vital partnership – he’s been a trusted partner in crafting realistic solutions, plans, requirements, and in fact, that’s what I value so much in Sandy, and what is so rare, is that he generates actual solutions to problems. For the past several months as Secretary, I’ve been lucky to benefit from his expert advice. And I know, I watch, President Obama and his senior staff feel that way, too. I watch it. Sandy is preternaturally articulate, able to explain things without condescension or oversimplification. But even bigger than Sandy’s mind is his heart. And many of us have seen that up close, too. We’ve seen it in his many unheralded visits to hospitals. One time, he and Mary went up to Walter Reed and discovered the patients there didn’t have Wi-Fi connections. Sandy came back and made sure the problem got fixed – helping patients connect with their fellow wounded warriors, their battle buddies, and their families. I was at the Warrior Games a few weeks ago, and a servicemember came up in a wheelchair with his wife, and his wife pointed to the wheelchair and said, “We have that because of Mary Winnefeld.” Just out of the blue. “We have that because of Mary Winnefeld.” We’ve also seen that heart in the USO tours Sandy lifts – leads to lift the spirits of our troops around the world. In his will to get everything done during the day so he doesn’t have to miss any of his sons’ baseball games. In how he quietly, humbly mentors the enlisted, officer, and civilian men and women who serve on his small, yet highly effective staff – the so-called “Vice Squad” – so they can learn and grow into future leaders themselves. Sandy, that’s the legacy of excellence you leave with us. You’ve helped this department and its people succeed. In so doing, you’ve protected the American people, and you left a better world for our children. We can’t thank you enough for that. And although we know you won’t be going very far – after all, Nats Park’s right across the river – we’re still going to miss you very, very much. So on behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, I wish you, Mary, and your family fair winds and following seas, as they say, and some much-deserved rest. And as we look back on your career of service to our country, I think everyone’d agree with me in saying, it was cooler even than a nine-year-old could’ve imagined.

"Dec. 1, 2015","Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, all Members of this Committee:  Thank you for inviting me to discuss with Chairman Joe Dunford, our counter military campaign. And Chairman, I agree with you, we do need greater effort, we’re applying greater effort and we’re going to try to describe some of the ways that we’re doing that. And Mr. Smith, the underlying strategy and its clarity I’ll try to provide that clarity today. Now, ISIL’s attacks in Paris, like those it has perpetrated elsewhere, were barbaric and they were an assault on the civilization we defend.  ISIL requires, and it will receive, a lasting defeat.  The President had directed us to intensify and adapt the military campaign before the Paris attacks, and we will describe those new actions today.  We continue to accelerate our efforts in the wake of Paris, and we are urging others to do the same, because those attacks further highlighted the stakes that not just the United States but the world has in this fight. As I’ve discussed with you in the past, the United States’ strategy requires leveraging all the components of our nation’s might to destroy ISIL.  Every instrument of national power – diplomatic, military, intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security, economic, informational – is engaged and every national security agency is contributing to one of the strategy’s lines of effort.  We’re defending the homeland, acting to defeat ISIL in its core in Syria and Iraq, and taking appropriate action wherever else in the world this evil organization metastasizes. The Defense Department contributes to nearly all the lines of effort, but protecting the homeland is among our highest priorities.  We’re adapting to meet ISIL’s threat, including assuring the security of Defense Department installations and personnel.  And, just last week, I hosted some of the top national security and law enforcement leaders at the Pentagon to discuss efforts to cut off the flow of foreign fighters. We at the Defense Department, of course, are also centrally responsible for the military campaign, which will be the focus of my statement to this Committee.  Through our own action and those of our coalition partners, the military campaign will destroy ISIL’s leadership and forces, and deprive it of resources, and safe haven, and mobility – all while we seek to identify and then enable capable, motivated local forces on the ground to expel ISIL from its territory, hold and govern it, and ensure that victory sticks. That’s the right strategic approach for two principal reasons.  First, it emphasizes the necessity of capable, motived local forces – as the only force that can assure a lasting victory.  Such forces are hard to find, but they do exist.  And we can enable them – and we are constantly looking for effective ways to expand doing so and I’ll describe some of them – but we cannot substitute for them. And, second, this strategic approach sets the conditions for a political solution to the civil war in Syria and to crippling sectarianism in Iraq, which are the only durable ways to prevent a future ISIL-like organization from re-emerging.  And that’s why the diplomatic work, led by Secretary Kerry and the State Department, is the first and absolutely critical line of effort in our strategy. We are gathering momentum on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq.  And today, I will describe how the U.S. is continuing to accelerate the military campaign against ISIL, and what more we’re asking of our global partners.  While I can’t describe everything in this unclassified setting, I do want to take a few extra minutes this morning to give as much detail as possible about the new things we are doing to accelerate ISIL’s defeat. We’re at war.  We are using the might of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Tens of thousands of U.S. personnel are operating in the broader Middle East region, more are on the way.  We have some of our most advanced air and naval forces attacking ISIL.  U.S. troops are advising and assisting ground operations in Syria and Iraq.  I’ll describe briefly some of these efforts and how we’ll accelerate them. In northern Syria, local forces, with our support, are fighting along the Ma’ra line, engaging ISIL in the last remaining pocket of access into Turkey.  Meanwhile, a coalition of Syrian Arabs that we helped equip in Northeastern Syria – with statutory authorizations and funds provided by Congress for which we’re grateful – are fighting alongside Kurdish forces and have recaptured important terrain, most recently pushing ISIL out of the town of Al Hawl and at least 900 square kilometers of surrounding territory.  They are now focused on moving south to isolate ISIL’s nominal capital of Raqqa, with the ultimate objective of collapsing its control over that city. This momentum on the ground in northern Syria has been enabled by increased coalition airstrikes as well as support on the ground.  In early November, we deployed additional strike aircraft to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.  These and other aircraft in the region combined with improved intelligence allowed us, in November, to significantly increase our airstrikes against ISIL, to the highest level since the start of operations in August 2014. To build on that momentum, we’re sending – on President Obama’s orders and the Chairman’s and my advice – Special Operations forces personnel to Syria to support the fight against ISIL.  American special operators bring a unique suite of capabilities that make them force multipliers: they will help us garner valuable ground intelligence, further enhance our air campaign, and above all enable local forces that can regain and then hold territory occupied by ISIL.  Where we find further opportunity to leverage such capability, we are prepared to expand it. Next, in the south of Syria, we are also taking advantage of opportunities to open a southern front on ISIL, by enabling fighters, trained and equipped by us and other Coalition partners, to conduct strikes inside Syria.  We’re also enhancing the border control and defenses of a key ally, Jordan, with additional military assets and assistance. In northern Iraq, Peshmerga units, with the help of U.S. air power and advisers, have retaken the town of Sinjar, cutting the main line of communication between Raqqa and Mosul, the two largest cities under ISIL’s control.  To move people and supplies, ISIL now must rely on backroads, where we locate and destroy them. Elsewhere in Iraq, we have about 3,500 troops at six locations in Iraq in support of Iraqi Security Forces, the ISF.  There, we’ve been providing increased lethal fire and augmenting the existing training, advising, and assisting program.  And we’re prepared to do more as Iraq shows capability and motivation in the counter-ISIL fight and in resolving its political divisions. Now, the progress in the Sunni portions of Iraq – as the campaign to recapture Ramadi shows – has been slow, much to our and Prime Minister Abadi’s frustration.  Despite his efforts, sectarian politics and Iranian influence have made building a multi-sectarian Iraqi Security Force difficult, with some notable exceptions, such as the effective U.S.-trained counter-terrorism forces.  We continue to offer additional U.S. support of all kinds and urge Baghdad to enroll, train, arm, and pay Sunni Arab fighters, as well as local Sunni Arab police forces, to hold territory recaptured from ISIL. All these efforts – from northern Syria through Iraq – have shrunk the ISIL-controlled territory in both.  Importantly, we now have an opportunity to divide ISIL’s presence in Iraq from that in Syria.  This could be important because, while both countries are plagued by ISIL, each, as I said earlier, has different political pathologies that provide the opportunity for extremism, and they ultimately require different kinds of political progress to assure lasting victory. Next, in full coordination with the Government of Iraq, we're deploying a specialized expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces and put even more pressure on ISIL.  These special operators will over time be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders.  This force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations into Syria.  That creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, which generates more targets, more raids, and more momentum.  The raids in Iraq will be done at the invitation of the Iraqi government and focused on defending its borders and building the ISF's own capability. Next, we are also significantly expanding U.S. attacks on ISIL’s infrastructure and sources of revenue, particularly its oil revenue.  Over the past several weeks, because of improved intelligence and understanding of ISIL’s financial operations, we’ve intensified the air campaign against ISIL’s war-sustaining oil enterprise, a critical pillar of ISIL’s financial infrastructure.  In addition to destroying fixed facilities like wells and processing facilities, we’ve destroyed nearly 400 of ISIL’s oil tanker trucks, reducing a major source of its daily revenues.  There’s more to come too. And we’re improving our capability to eliminate ISIL’s leadership, by conducting raids using the expeditionary target force I discussed a moment ago and also targeted airstrikes.  Since I last appeared before this committee in June, we have removed some key ISIL figures from the battlefield – Hajji Mutaz, ISIL’s second in command; Junaid Hussein, a key external operative actively plotting against our servicemembers; “Jihadi John,” an ISIL executioner; and Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya.  Like previous actions, these strikes serve notice to ISIL that no target is beyond our reach. Finally, even as we work to defeat ISIL in Syria and Iraq, where its parent tumor has grown, we also recognize ISIL has metastasized elsewhere.  The threat posed by ISIL, and groups like it, can span regions and our own combatant commands.  That’s why the Defense Department is organizing a new way to leverage infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Levant, East Africa, and Southern Europe into a unified capability to counter transnational and transregional threats like ISIL. An example of this network in action was our recent strike on Abu Nabil, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill this ISIL leader in Libya. As that strike shows, there’s a lot of potential here, but to do more, we need to be creative, and consider changes to how the Defense Department works and is structured.  This could be an important focus of any new Goldwater-Nichols-type reforms, which I know this committee, and particularly Chairman Thornberry, is exploring.  I welcome this timely review and look forward to working with you on it, as we complete our own ongoing reform initiatives in the Department. These are eight areas—just eight—of the adaptations we’ve made over the past six weeks to accelerate this campaign, and we’ve seen momentum build.  Chairman Dunford, if I can compliment him for a moment, has been a tremendous source of actionable ideas.  We’ve also seen real ingenuity from our team at CENTCOM, and many of the other combatant commands involved in this fight.  And President Obama is committed to doing what it takes…as opportunities arise, as we see what works, and as the enemy adapts…until ISIL is defeated in a lasting way. France has been galvanized by the attacks in its capital, and the French have intensified their role.  Britain is debating expanded airstrikes.  Italy has made important contributions in Iraq.  And Germany is making additional contributions. But we all, let me repeat all, must do more.  Turkey must do more to control its often porous border.  Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states joined the air campaign in the early days, but have since been pre-occupied by the conflict in Yemen. Meanwhile, Russia, which has publicly committed to defeating ISIL, has instead largely attacked opposition forces, not ISIL.  It is time for Russia to focus on the right side of this fight. American leadership is essential, but the more contributions we receive from other nations, the greater combat power we can achieve using our own force.  Just as importantly, we also need to leverage our allies and partners’ relationships and capabilities to effectively work with Syrians and Iraqis, who in the end must expel ISIL and restore effective governance. The President, Secretary Kerry, and I have spoken to many of our counterparts, and the Chairman has as well.  And we’re encouraging them to provide additional strike and support aircraft, as well as Special Operations personnel; deeper and more effective intelligence sharing; additional train, advise, and assist personnel and resources; combat search and rescue capabilities; combat support and combat service support; base security forces; and additional economic aid and humanitarian assistance. As I conclude, I want to commend this committee on last month’s budget deal, which is the kind of deal I called for back in March before this committee.  It was a consequential agreement for the nation’s security and we’re grateful for it. Thank you. ",Statement on the U.S. Military Strategy in the Middle East and the Counter-ISIL Campaign before the House Armed Services Committee,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/631649/statement-on-the-us-military-strategy-in-the-middle-east-and-the-counter-isil-c/
"June 30, 2016","Good afternoon.  Thanks for being here.  I’m here today to announce some changes in the Defense Department’s policies regarding transgender servicemembers. Before I announce what changes we’re making, I want to explain why.  And there are three main reasons – having to do with our future force, our current force, and matters of principle. The first and fundamental reason is that the Defense Department and the military need to avail ourselves of all talent possible in order to remain what we are now – the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Our mission is to defend this country, and we don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who can best accomplish the mission.  We have to have access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified – and to retain them. Now, while there isn’t definitive data on the number of transgender servicemembers, RAND looked at the existing studies out there and their best estimate was that about 2,500 people out of approximately 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers and about 1,500 out of approximately 825,000 reserve servicemembers are transgender, with the upper end of their range of estimates of around 7,000 in the active component and 4,000 in the reserves. Although relatively few in number, we’re talking about talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction.  We invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and develop each individual, and we want to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we’ve invested in and who have proven themselves. And this brings me to the second reason, which is that the reality is that we have transgender servicemembers serving in uniform today, and I have a responsibility to them and to their commanders to provide them both with clearer and more consistent guidance than is provided by current policies. We owe commanders better guidance on how to handle questions such as deployment, medical treatment and other matters. And this is particularly true for small unit leaders, like our senior enlisteds and junior officers. Also, right now, most of our transgender servicemembers must go outside the military medical system in order to obtain medical care that is judged by doctors to be necessary, and they have to pay for it out of their own pockets.  This is inconsistent with our promise to all our troops that we will take care of them and pay for necessary medical treatment. I and the Defense Department’s other senior leaders who have been studying this issue over the past year have met with some of these transgender servicemembers – they’ve deployed all over the world, serving on aircraft, submarines, forward operating bases, and right here in the Pentagon.  And while I learned that in most cases their peers and local commanders have recognized the value of retaining high-quality people, I also learned that the lack of clear guidelines for how to handle this issue puts the commanders and the servicemembers in a difficult and unfair position.  One servicemember I met with described how some people had urged him to leave the military because of the challenges he was facing with our policies, and he said he just wouldn’t quit.  He was too committed to the mission and this was where he wanted to be.  These are the kind of people we want serving in our military. The third and final reason, also important, is a matter of principle.  Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so.  After all, our all-volunteer force is built upon having the most qualified Americans.  And the profession of arms is based on honor and trust. Army Chief of Staff General Milley recently reminded us of this, when he said, and I quote him, “The United States Army is open to all Americans who meet the standard, regardless of who they are.  Embedded within our Constitution is that very principle, that all Americans are free and equal.  And we as an Army are sworn to protect and defend that very principle.  And we are sworn to even die for that principle.  So if we in uniform are willing to die for that principle, then we in uniform should be willing to live by that principle.”  That’s General Milley. In view of these three reasons to change our policy, last July I directed the commencement of a study to identify the practical issues related to transgender Americans serving openly, and to develop an implementation plan that addresses those issues consistent with military readiness – because our mission, which is defending this country, has to come first. I directed the working group to start with the presumption that transgender persons can serve openly without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness, unless and except where objective, practical impediments are identified. It’s been an educational process for a lot of people here in the Department, including me.  We had to look carefully and deliberately at medical, legal, and policy considerations that have been evolving very rapidly in recent years, and we had to take into account the unique nature of military readiness and make sure we got it right.  I’m proud of the thoughtful and deliberate manner in which the Department’s leadership has pursued this review.  I’ve been guided throughout by one central question: is someone the best qualified servicemember to accomplish our mission? Let me now describe the process we used to study this over the last year. The leadership of the armed services – the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Service Secretaries, myself, together with personnel, training, readiness, and medical specialists from across the Department of Defense – studied the available data.  We also had the RAND Corporation analyze relevant data and studies to help us with our review.  And we got input from transgender servicemembers, from outside expert groups, and from medical professionals outside of the Department. We looked carefully at what lessons could be learned from the outside, including from allied militaries that already allow transgender servicemembers to serve openly, and from the private sector also – because even though we’re not a business, and are different from a company in important ways, their experience and practices are still relevant. It’s worth noting, for example, that at least 18 countries already allow transgender personnel to serve openly in their militaries.  These include close allies such as the UK, Israel, and Australia, and we were able to study how they dealt with this issue. We also saw that among doctors, employers, and insurance companies today, providing medical care for transgender individuals is becoming common and normalized – in both public and private sectors alike.  Today, over a third of Fortune 500 companies – including companies like Boeing, CVS, and Ford – offer employee health insurance plans with transgender-inclusive coverage.  That’s up from zero such companies in 2002.  Similarly, non-discrimination policies at two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies now cover gender identity, up from just 3 percent in 2002.  And for the public sector, all civilian federal employees have access today to a health insurance plan that provides comprehensive coverage for transgender-related care and medical treatment.  All this represents a sea change from even just a decade ago. Based on its analysis of allied militaries, and the expected rate at which American transgender servicemembers would require medical treatment that would impact their fitness for duty and deployability, RAND’s analysis concluded that there would be “minimal readiness impacts from allowing transgender servicemembers to serve openly.” And in terms of cost, RAND concluded the health care costs would represent, again, their words, “an exceedingly small proportion” of DOD’s overall health care expenditures. Now, as a result of this year-long study, I’m announcing today that we are ending the ban on transgender Americans in the United States military.  Effective immediately, transgender Americans may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military just for being transgender. Additionally, I have directed that the gender identity of an otherwise qualified individual will not bar them from military service, or from any accession program. In taking these steps, we’re eliminating policies that can result in transgender servicemembers being treated differently from their peers based solely upon their gender identity rather than their ability to serve.  And we’re confirming that, going forward, we will apply the same general principles, standards, and procedures to transgender servicemembers as we do to all servicemembers.  What I heard from the transgender servicemembers I met with, overwhelmingly, was that they don’t want special treatment, they want to be held to the same standards and be treated like everyone else. As I directed, the study identified practical issues that arise with respect to transgender service.  And it developed an implementation plan to address those issues.  Let me briefly describe that implementation plan to address those issues. I want to emphasize that in this case, as in the Department’s decisions on “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and Women-in-Service, simply declaring a change in policy is not effective implementation.  That’s why we have worked hard on the implementation plan and must continue to do so. These policies will be implemented in stages over the next 12 months – starting most immediately with guidance for current servicemembers and their commanders, followed by training for the entire force, and then beginning to access new military servicemembers who are transgender.  Implementation will begin today. Starting today:  Otherwise qualified servicemembers can no longer be involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service just for being transgender. Then, no later than 90 days from today:  The Department will complete and issue both a commanders’ guidebook for leading currently-serving transgender servicemembers, and medical guidance to doctors for providing transition-related care if required to currently-serving transgender servicemembers.  Our military treatment facilities will begin providing transgender servicemembers with all medically necessary care based on that medical guidance.  Also starting on that date, servicemembers will be able to initiate the process to officially change their gender in our personnel management systems. Next, over the 9 months that follow, based on detailed guidance and training materials that will be prepared, the services will conduct training of the force – from commanders, to medical personnel, to the operating force and recruiters. When the training is complete, no later than one year from today, the military services will begin accessing transgender individuals who meet all standards – holding them to the same physical and mental fitness standards as everyone else who wants to join the military. Our initial accession policy will require an individual to have completed any medical treatment that their doctor has determined is necessary in connection with their gender transition and to have been stable in their identified gender for 18 months, as certified by their doctor, before they can enter the military.  I’ve directed that this accession standard be reviewed no later than 24 months from today to ensure it reflects what more we learn over the next two years as this is implemented as well as the most up to date medical knowledge. I’ve discussed the implementation plan with our senior military leaders, including Chairman Dunford.   The chiefs had specific recommendations about the timeline, and I made adjustments to the implementation plan timeline to incorporate those recommendations.  The Chairman has indicated that the Services support the final implementation timeline that I’ve laid out today. Overall, the policies we’re issuing today will allow us to access talent of transgender servicemembers to strengthen accomplishment of our mission, clarify guidance for commanders and military medical providers, and reflect better the Department’s and our nation’s principles. I want to close by emphasizing that deliberate and thoughtful implementation will be key.  I and the senior leaders of the Department will therefore be ensuring that all issues identified in the study are addressed in implementation.  I’m confident they can and will be addressed in implementation.  That’s why we’re taking the step-by-step approach I described. I’m 100 percent confident in the ability of our military leaders and all our men and women in uniform to implement these changes in a manner that both protects the readiness of the force and also upholds values cherished by the military – honor, trust, and judging every individual on their merits. I’m also confident that we have reason to be proud today of what this will mean for our military – because it’s the right thing to do, and it’s another step in ensuring that we continue to recruit and retain the most qualified people – and good people are the key to the best military in the world.  Our military, and the nation it defends, will be stronger. Thank you.

"Nov. 20, 2015","Thanks, Gail, thank you so much, thank you so much.  Thank you all for being here and thank you for honoring the wonderful institution it is my privilege to lead by this evening and with this event.  Thank you, from me. This organization, this wonderful thing called the Red Cross by adapting to new challenges and opportunities throughout a long, long history, you’ve continued to guide us all toward achieving the vision of the Red Cross.  And Gail, you, above all in this era. Thank you. At a time when we see evil strike in all to many places all over the world, and we act to defeat them, as we will, it’s organizations like the American Red Cross that stand as a force for good, a reminder that America itself, a reminder of the collective people of goodwill who stand with us, in so many ways, around the world.  This organization has always stood for something bigger than any one person, even any one nation.  And I’m proud to stand with you. Before I continue, I want to thank JR. This is a guy with a lot of selflessness and a determined spirit that he uses to assist others.  I’ve known him for quite a while now; I think the time I first saw you, you were at BAMC, or what used to be called BAMC in San Antonio. And then again at the Pentagon a couple of years ago.  JR, thank you.  You honor us with your presence. I also want to take a moment to congratulate Major Katelyn van Dam, who’s right down there also.  I say this for her in her own right, but unfortunately we all—you, JR, me—we all are ourselves, and we stand for something also.  So I need to say that there are young women across America – future Marines – who are inspired by trailblazers like you. And finally, I want to congratulate Bob and Elizabeth Dole, who were honored earlier this evening.   It was my pleasure to see them in Rome last month, as they prepared to return to Castel D’Aiano, a stark place, to visit the hillside that changed Bob’s life forever.  Even as Bob and Elizabeth have changed America’s life forever. All you have to do is go down to the Mall where that wonderful, wonderful place that wouldn’t be there if it were not for the Doles. You can walk up the street up from the American Red Cross Headquarters, ditto.  It says “American Red Cross” and it stands for something that’s been part of the life blood of the country for a long time and the Doles are like that. And I’m so proud be with you tonight and so honored to be in your presence. Bob and Elizabeth have spent a lifetime making a difference for those who’ve served in every generation, and for their families. Their efforts, like those of the Red Cross, have given countless people the gift of a better life. On that note, when I was sworn in as Secretary among the principle commitments I made was to our people—our active duty, our Guard and Reserve, our civilians, our veterans, and all of their families. And as I accept this, which is my honor to do tonight, the privilege of accepting this recognition tonight, I do so, and I mean this, wholly on behalf of them.  On behalf of those who step forward to serve.  On behalf of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  It’s them that you honor tonight. And we got to thank the Red Cross on their behalf, and therefore, on my behalf, for always being there for service members, their families, and their survivors.  In the past year, your volunteers have given 1.25 million hours of their time at home and abroad. From living rooms on the homefront, to the front lines at Camp Lemonnier and Camp Arifjan, you’re everywhere we need you to be. As Clara Barton said, even ""in a time of peace, assuaging the ills that are sure to accompany war” is – as she called it – “a wise benevolence.” At the Department of Defense, we strive, every day, to reach for that same brand of “wise benevolence,” In times of peace or war. We strive to support service members, their spouses, and their children – because that’s our total obligation.  We strive to take the utmost care in understanding the circumstances that require we put America's brave sons and daughters in harm’s way – and we strive to be there to support them before, during, and after.  No matter what. Yes, not only do we strive to do these things, but we always strive to do them better.  We are a learning organization, that’s our great strengths—one of America’s great strengths. And as we build the force of the future, recruiting and retaining the best America has to offer, we will continue to look to the grateful citizens of this nation to support our military families, care for our veterans, and to be there for those who valiantly step forward to serve. That is the power of the Red Cross, the tradition of engaged citizenry, and the example that you set for the world, even as we attempt to set an example as America. So let me close tonight by not only by thanking you for this honor, on behalf of the finest fighting force the world has ever known, but for your continued commitment to this nation, and to our men and women in uniform, to their mission, to their families, and to the values that make us all proud to be on America’s team. Thank you very much.

"Jan. 28, 2015","Mr. President, thank you. I’m very grateful to you for many reasons.  But first, thank you for being here today.  I know the kind of schedule that you have been on, and the length of the trip, the intensity of those visits...and to make this effort today means an awful lot.  Thank you. I want to also thank you for giving me the honor of serving you and the American people as the Secretary of Defense.  I will always be grateful, always grateful for that opportunity. And Mr. President, thank you for your strong leadership at a very difficult time: a difficult time in our world that requires wise, steady, careful leadership.  You have and you are providing that leadership, and I have been very proud to serve with you in the Senate – and in particular, over the last two years as your Secretary of Defense. Vice President Biden, thank you as well for being here today.  I have not forgotten some of the stories that you told.  I recall very well us calling my mother on that trip through the mountains of Iraq, and I remember you wanted to speak with her. And hours and hours later... ... She never forgot that, Mr. Vice President, and was so proud of that phone conversation.  And so I thank you for your generous reaching out to my mother at a very difficult time for her.  Because she – she was gone about a month later.  So, thank you. One of my greatest joys during my time here in Washington has been development of our friendship.  And as you have noted, and as the president has noted, our time together, the three of us, on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – Secretary Kerry is here today, who knows a little something about this business, and to you Secretary Kerry, thank you.  I include you in those days. Our former chairman, Chairman Lugar, is here as well.  And to Dick Lugar, thank you.  As you have noted, there are special people in our lives that we benefit from, and certainly Dick Lugar is one of those I think we all have benefited a great deal from. And Vice President Biden, thank you for your years of service to this country as well. Chairman Dempsey, it has been a great privilege for this old sergeant to have worked side by side with a general of your character and your courage.  I’ve been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job, especially during those self-help and educational opportunities called congressional hearings. I was always reassured in each of those hearings, as we would drive to the Hill in the morning, knowing that Marty Dempsey was next to me.  And for what you have meant to our military, Marty, and what you continue to do for this country, thank you very much. I see another great icon of the United States Senate with us today: Senator John Warner, who we all worked closely with and benefited from.  And to our distinguished colleagues, Senators Warner and Lugar, welcome and thank you for what you have done for this country, as so many of you here today.  And I am grateful that you would take the time to visit us on this – on this occasion. To the chiefs of the services, our senior civilian leaders, and the combatant commanders, thank you.  Thank you for your unflagging service and your leadership and your commitment to this country. I want to particularly acknowledge Bob Work – Bob Work, our Deputy Secretary of Defense.  I thank him for his leadership and our strong partnership over the last year.  And my appreciation as well to Ash Carter: for Ash’s service and his partnership during my first year at the Pentagon, and for his continued commitment to public service. And my heartfelt thanks to my security and advance staff.  Each of you played critically important roles for which my family and I will always be grateful.  To my personal staff and those in the office of the secretary, you’ve been indispensable, indispensable in helping me carry out my responsibilities, and I thank you. And to the men and women who serve our country and their families, whose service and sacrifice is unequaled, you have my deepest gratitude.  We salute your high purpose in defense of our freedoms and our values.  Every day, you wake up, and you go to work knowing that this department – this department alone – is charged with one fundamental mission: the security of this nation.  It’s been my absolute privilege to have been on your team. Over the past two years, I’ve witnessed the courage and dignity of America’s servicemen and women all over the world.  I’ve seen young enlisted and young officers do their jobs realizing that how – how they do their jobs is just as important as the job itself. I’ve seen senior officers and senior enlisted realizing that they are role models.  Maybe their highest responsibility of all.  And I’ve seen the enduring devotion and commitment of their families: the mothers, the fathers, husbands, wives, children, and the sacrifices that they willingly – willingly make for our country. Their individual commitment to the greater good and strength of the institution has been a complete inspiration to me in every way.  They understand that it’s people, people who build and strengthen institutions and make the world a better place. These are the reasons why America’s military is the most admired and most trusted institution in our country.  We must always protect that confidence and trust by our conduct and our performance – continuing to hold ourselves and each other to the highest standards of professionalism and personal behavior. As I will soon leave this job that I have cherished for the last two years, I want you all to know that the things that I have most respected and most admired are your dignity, your courage, and your dedication. The opportunity to have been part of all this is something I could not have imagined when I joined the Army 48 years ago.  No high office with responsibility is easy, as everyone in this room knows. But with each difficult challenge comes the satisfaction of knowing – knowing that you are like Teddy Roosevelt’s man in the arena, slugging it out, doing what you believe, doing what you like, and doing it your way.  And recognizing that it’s not the critics who count or change the world or make the world better, but rather it’s those who are willing to work, work very hard toward building a better world. We live in a complicated and defining time.  The men and women who have devoted their lives to America’s security are the architects of this new, 21st century world.  They’re building onto the great legacies and foundations that have been laid by those who have gone before them. We’ve made mistakes.  We will make more mistakes.  But we hold tightly to one of America’s greatest strengths: the capacity and the constitutional structure that allows us to self-correct.  We can change systems, right wrongs, solve problems, and start over.  But we must get the big things right. We must recognize that there is not an immediate answer to every problem.  Some problems require evolving solutions that give us the time and the space to adjust, and the patience to seek higher ground and lasting results. Our world, captive to immediacy, uncertainty, and complexity, is not moving toward less complicated problems, but rather, toward more global challenges rooted in historic injustices and conflicts. In this dynamic environment, we need to prioritize and focus on how – on how to build greater partnership capacity around the world with our partners, to help solve problems through coalitions of common interests that help build opportunities and create hope for all people. These are difficult and complicated tasks, but we have no choice.  It will require steady, wise, and judicious use of American power, prestige, and influence.  We must never fail to always ask the most important question when making decisions in policy: what happens next. With all the world’s travails and problems, it is still a hopeful world.  This I believe. I want to thank my wife, Lilibet, with whom I’ve shared this remarkable 30-year journey.  I could never have done this job without her by my side.  And I’m especially proud of her work on behalf of military families and other important issues to the men and women of the military.  I valued all of her many contributions to this institution, and I thank her deeply for helping me be a better Secretary of Defense. I want to also thank my daughter Allyn, my son Ziller, for their constant support, encouragement, and always good advice...and helping me with the internet...and recognizing and allowing me to take inventory in that recognition that I am not near as smart as I thought I was.  Those are the humbling experiences of parenthood.  Those of us who’ve had the opportunity to know those days and have that experience and be blessed with that experience know so well. And to my brothers, Tom and Mike, who have truly been with me since this train left the station in Nebraska many years ago, thank you. And one last point: Of all the opportunities my life has given me – and I have been blessed with so many – I am most proud of having once been a soldier. The lessons from my time in uniform about trust, responsibility, duty, judgment, and loyalty to your fellow soldier – these I have carried with me throughout my life. May God bless and keep each of you.  Thank you. ",Farewell Ceremony,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606640/farewell-ceremony/
"March 3, 2015","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Reed, and all the members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to be here today with you, and thank you for confirming me as Secretary of Defense. I’m honored by the trust and confidence of President Obama in appointing me, and the Senate in confirming me. My care and respect for the men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known is as boundless as their skill and devotion. I know this committee shares the same devotion to them – and shares responsibility for them, and for the defense of our great country. And I hope that my tenure as Secretary of Defense will be marked by partnership with you on their behalf. I’m here to present the President’s budget for the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2016. Since I’ve been on the job for exactly two weeks, it’s plain that I did not have a role in shaping this budget. But I’ve studied it carefully, and I’m fully prepared to answer your questions about it, and to work with you to find common ground where you have concerns. Most importantly, I strongly support the President in requesting a defense budget above the artificial caps of the Budget Control Act – above the so-called sequester levels – next year and the years thereafter. I share the President’s desire to find a way forward that upholds the fundamental principles behind the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. And I support the President’s commitment to vetoing any bill that locks in sequestration. Because to do otherwise would be both unsafe and wasteful. Before I turn to the budget to explain what I mean by that, allow me to share some observations from my short time on the job – observations that help reinforce my testimony here. Shortly after I was sworn in, I spoke to the people of the Department of Defense – military, civilian, and contractor – and told them I had three commitments as Secretary of Defense. The first is to them and their families – to their safety, their welfare, and their effectiveness – and equally to those who came before them, and to those who will come after them. The second commitment is to assist the President as he makes difficult decisions about how to defend the country in a turbulent world, and then to carry out those decisions where they involve the use of military force. And the third commitment is to the future – to make sure our military remains the very best in an ever-changing world, amid fast- moving technological and commercial change, and as we seek to attract new generations to the mission of national security. Because of those commitments, I traveled at the end of my first week on the job to Afghanistan to visit our troops and commanders, and also the leaders of Afghanistan and some of their military leaders. I wanted to assess the conditions on the ground there as we enter a new phase of our long campaign, and as we carry out the transition to an enduring presence that will ensure, as the President says, our progress in Afghanistan sticks. Next I traveled to Kuwait, where I met with the Amir before convening senior American diplomats and military leaders from throughout the region – ambassadors from several countries, our commanders from CENTCOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM, and SOCOM, and the commanders of the campaign in Iraq and Syria against ISIL. I wanted to hear directly from them about the complex political and military situation in the region, and about the best approaches to leveraging U.S. leadership of the broad coalition combating this ugly scourge. And this afternoon, I’d be pleased to discuss these challenges or any others – the Chairman mentioned Ukraine – in addition to the budget. The point is that in these regions of the world, just as in the Asia-Pacific, in Europe, and elsewhere, it’s America’s leadership, America’s men and women in uniform, who frequently stand between order and disorder – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing with those who believe, with us, in a more secure, just, and prosperous future for all our children. But this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so. The Administration is proposing to increase the defense budget in line with the projection submitted to Congress last year. By halting the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. But – and I want to be clear about this – under sequestration, which is set to return in 212 days, our nation would be less secure. Mr. Chairman, as you yourself have reminded Congress, sequestration threatens our military’s readiness, the size of our warfighting forces, the capabilities of our air and naval fleets, and ultimately, the lives of our men and women in uniform. The Joint Chiefs have said the same before this committee – and they could not have been more clear – in their assessment of the damage sequestration would do to our national security. I want to commend you and thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Reed, for your very thoughtful letter to the leadership of the Senate Budget Committee about the dangers of sequestration. And I completely agree with you that the threat of sequestration is, as you said, “a national security crisis of the first order.” The great tragedy is that this corrosive damage to our national security is not the result of objective factors, logic, or reason. It’s not that we have some new breakthrough in military technology or some novel strategic insight that somehow provides the same security for a smaller budget. It’s not that sequester is forced upon us by economic emergency or dire recession that makes taking grave security risks absolutely necessary. It’s surely not the case that the world has suddenly become more stable, or that America has less to do to keep it safe, allowing us to take a peace dividend. It’s not even that these cuts solve the nation’s overall fiscal challenges – because the sad math is that they are large and sudden enough to damage defense but fail to resolve our long-term fiscal issues and the real drivers of the deficit and debt. Sequester was not the result of objective factors. Sequester is purely the fallout of political gridlock. Its purpose was to compel prudent compromise on our long-term fiscal challenges – compromise that never came. This has been compounded in recent years, because the Defense Department has suffered a double-whammy – the worst of both worlds – that has coupled mindless sequestration with constraints on our ability to reform. We need your help with both. I know that Chairman McCain, Senator Reed, and others on this committee are as committed to reform as I am. And I look forward to working with you on new reforms. We at the Pentagon can and must do better at getting value for the defense dollar. Taxpayers have trouble comprehending, let alone supporting the defense budget, when they hear about cost overruns, insufficient accounting and accountability, needless overhead, excess infrastructure and the like. There are significant savings to be found through new reforms across DoD – reforms that we’re committed to pursuing. But sequester cuts don’t help us achieve any of them. In fact, the nature of sequester frequently leads to waste – as, for example, when it forces a reduction in contract production rates, driving up unit costs. But at the same time that I’m committed to new and further reforms, I must note that in the past several years, painful but necessary reforms proposed by DoD – reforms involving elimination of overhead and unneeded infrastructure, retirement of older force structure and reasonable adjustments in compensation – have been denied by Congress. I need your help with these reforms, which have been frustrated at the same time sequester looms, and at the same time as – and at the same time as we make new reforms. I will work with Congress to resolve concerns and find common ground, but we must have your help. If confronted with sequester-level budgets and continued obstacles to reform, I do not believe that we can simply keep making incremental cuts while maintaining the same general set of objectives that have anchored our defense strategy. We would have to change the shape, and not just the size, of our military – significantly impacting parts of our defense strategy. We cannot meet sequester with further half measures. As Secretary of Defense, I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, or ineffective doctrine. But everything else is on the table – including parts of our budget that have long been considered inviolate. This may lead to decisions that no Americans – including members of Congress – want us to make. I’m not afraid to ask the difficult questions, but if we are stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. So instead of sequestration, I urge you to urge your colleagues to embrace the alternative: building the force of the future, powerful enough to underwrite our strategy, equipped with boldly new technology, leading in domains like cyber and space – as the Chairman and Senator Reed said – attracting and retaining the best Americans to our mission, being lean and efficient throughout our enterprise, and showing resolve to friends and potential foes alike. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was more complicated than anyone could’ve predicted. Given today’s security environment, the President’s proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is responsible, and it’s prudent. I earnestly hope we can come together behind a long-term budget approach that dispels sequester and provides stability, rather than doing this one year at a time. I hope we can again unite behind what our great nation should – and must – do to protect our people and make a better world. And I hope we can provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they need, and what they fully deserve. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to your questions.

"July 26, 2016","Thanks, Raj. Thanks very much for that introduction. Secretary Ash here from the state of Massachusetts, I like you already, Secretary Ash. OK. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us. It's great to be back in Cambridge today to open up the east coast node of the Defense Department's technology startup, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx. And with the Boston area's rich legacy of public service, not to mention its status today as a landmark hub of innovative thinking and innovative technology, we couldn't have picked a better place for our startup. I created DIUx last year because one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build and in some cases rebuild the bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and America's wonderfully innovative and open technology community. That's important because we've had a long history of partnership, working together to develop and advance technologies like the internet, GPS, and before that satellite communication and the jet engine. Not only benefiting both our security and our society, but truthfully changing our entire world. And that cooperation among industry, the academy and government helped make our military what it is today, the finest fighting force the world has ever known. There's no one stronger and there's no one more capable, and that's a fact that every American ought to be proud of, and I certainly am. But it's also a fact that our military's excellence isn't a birthright. It's not a guarantee. We can't take it for granted in the 21st century. We have to earn it again and again. And today, it's imperative we do so because we live in a changing and competitive world. Technology itself is an example of that change. When I began my career in physics years ago, most technology of consequence originated in America. And much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense. And today, we're still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial. The technology base is global, as Raj has noted, and other countries have been trying to catch up to the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap. And moreover, technologies once possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less capable forces and even non-state actors. And at the same time, our reliance on things like satellites and the internet can lead to vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. So, to stay ahead of all these challenges, to stay the best, I've been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds, technological, organizational, operational, and in the talent management of our all- volunteer force. One way we're doing that is by pushing the envelope with R&D and new technologies. Like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, undersea drones and many, many, many others. And we're making some serious investments here. The latest budget I've proposed will invest $72 billion in research and development next year alone. And for context, that's more than double what Intel, Apple and Google spent on R&D last year combined. Another way we're investing in innovation is through people. We're building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions. So more of America's brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time, or for a project. And so our military and civilian technologists for their part in the innovative defense industry that supports us already can interact in new ways with the entire innovative ecosystem. Innovative technologies and people are necessary but not sufficient which is why we're also investing in innovative practices and organizational structures. The world we live in demands it. While the Cold War arms race was characterized by strength with the leader simply having more, bigger and better weapons; into today's era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility. Leading the race now depends on who can out innovate faster than anyone else. It's no longer just a matter of what we buy, now more than ever it also matters how we buy things. How quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from. And how quickly and creatively we can adapt and use them in different and innovative ways. All this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies. And to ensure we keep adopting more innovative practices in the future, I recently created the New Defense Innovation Board chaired by Google Alphabet's Eric Schmidt to advise me and future Defense Secretaries on how to continue building bridges to the technology community and how we continue to change to be more competitive. More on that in a few minutes. Finally, one more way we're investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector across America's many great hubs of unrivaled innovation. Places like Austin, Seattle, Silicon Valley and of course right here in Boston. And that's where DIUx comes in. And that's why I'm here. Over the last 11 months – since we first opened the doors of the West Coast office in Silicon Valley – DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the tech community. It's helped us connect with hundreds of entrepreneurs and firms – making great progress in putting commercially-based innovation into the hands of America's soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. And it's helped us learn a lot too – identifying not only our successes but also our shortcomings. Both in how we engage with tech companies and in the tools we use to accelerate the uptake of technology in the Department of Defense. So two-and-a-half months ago we put that knowledge into practice. We took a page straight out of the startup play book by iterating rapidly and then launching DIUx 2.0 with several new features. It now reports directly to my office. It has its own contracting capability and budget resources. It has a new flatter partnership-style leadership structure led by managing partner Raj Shah – F-16 pilot and co-founder of successful technology startup. And with the opening of this office here in Boston, we've made in the DIUx 2.0 a nationwide release. Now, over the last 10 weeks, Raj and his team have been very busy. First of all, they've reorganized DIUx into three teams. They have an Engagement team which not only introduces the military to entrepreneurs but also – and more importantly – introduces entrepreneurs to military problems. We have some of the most exciting and consequential problems you get can in technology in our department and in our mission. Combined with our mission of defending this country, that's one of the strongest attractors for innovators and technologists who want to make a difference in the world. So the Engagement team is critical. DIUx also has a Foundry team, which works with technology that's either still maturing or that might need to be significantly adapted before we can use it. To do this effectively, they've launched a Warfighter-in-Residence program and an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program which bring together servicemen and women detailed from across the military with top engineers contracted from outside the military for focused design sprints, rapid prototyping and field trials. One of the first things they're doing is exploring the potential military applications of virtual and augmented reality technologies, which will continue to mature as tech companies’ major investments in these areas come to fruition. They'll also work on new applications for commercial space technologies, advanced aerial robotics and autonomous vehicles. The third and largest team is the Venture team, which is tasked with identifying emerging commercial technologies and exploring their applicability to potential military and civilian customers across the department. Now, while they might sound familiar, I have to emphasize that there's a critical difference between what DIUx's Venture team does and what a venture capital firm does.: instead of making equity investments, the venture team makes R&D awards. But they're able to work with anyone, from two people in a garage or a dorm room all the way up to mature tech companies. They operate on a co-investment model – On any project that DIUx moves forward with, they aim to match funding and staffing resources with a customer organization within DOD. That way, they can ensure not only that the product meets the customer's needs, but also that they have a partner to drive post-prototype transition. With these three teams – Engagement, Foundry and Venture -- it's important to note the value that DIUx 2.0 has to offer our department. Because of its tech scouting prowess and deep network with the technology and venture capital community, DIUx has a unique ability to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit, including many so-called stealth startups that aren't even officially opened for business yet. This significantly enlarges our defense industrial base and helps existing DOD components who partner with DIUx to locate cutting-edge and best-in-breed technology, whether in a garage in Silicon Valley, a lab in Boston or a successful firm that's never worked with us before. And by rapidly capitalizing on that, DIUx can help the rest of DOD move much faster, delivering the fruits of America's unparalleled technology economy to the warfighter in weeks and months rather than years. That ability – to move at the speed of business is possible because the DIUx 2.0 team pioneered a new and an innovative method for defense acquisition. They did this working with experts from the Army Contracting Command New Jersey at Picatinny Arsenal – especially one of Picatinny's key leaders, Paul Milenkowic, who's here today – where is Paul? Where did you go, Paul? Raise your hand, Paul. You're supposed to be up here. Paul, well done. They developed what they call a commercial solutions opening, which leverages expanded acquisition authorities for prototyping that Congress could fund last fall. Here's how it works: To start, DIUx posts on their website a particular problem we need to solve that we think might have a commercially based solution – maybe we want to find a way to patch unknown cyber vulnerabilities in our networks, maybe we're looking for a way to quickly scale up production of the 3D printed micro drones that we're developing. Next, any interested company can share information on their technologies and how they propose to solve the problem. And if they're invited to, they then pitch their solutions to the DIUx partners, using the same pitch deck and short concept papers they use to pitch their venture capital firms or their private sector customers. It's a merit-based competition that's truly accessible. Any startup or commercial firm could submit a proposal. From there, things can move very, very quickly. Once the most promising solution is identified, DIUx can then negotiate and execute fast, flexible, and collaborative awards with the goal to issue funding within 60 days of a first meeting with the company. And later, if the military customer is satisfied and wants to move to follow-on production, they can do so much more swiftly as well. This new approach is already generating lots of enthusiasm. Our military services, combatant commands and defense agencies like the speed and the agility it affords. Tech companies like that they can work with DIUx to design projects jointly, negotiate appropriate agreement clauses – including those concerning intellectual property rights – and move rapidly to make adjustments as needed. And there's value for everyone in being able to start with a problem set and a few perimeters, rather than having to meet a specific laundry list of predetermined and sometimes rigid capability requirements, which is how it usually works in defense acquisition. At DIUx, companies get the freedom to engage in the discovery process, which is often the most interesting part, and customers get more innovative solutions. And more important than enthusiasm, this is generating results. Within five weeks on the job, Raj and his team developed and launched the Commercial Solutions Opening to begin work on 15 separate prototyping projects. And the first agreement was signed in only 31 days with a company named Halo Neuroscience. They've invented a wearable device that looks like a pair of headphones and uses non-invasive electrical stimulation to increase the brain's natural ability to adapt to training. These headsets will be used by teams from our special operations forces who will work with Halo to gauge how effective their device might be to improving marksmanship, close-quarters combat skills and overall strength training. And that's just the first project on the books – many more projects are expected to be finalized in the next few weeks, covering diverse technology areas ranging from secure network mapping to autonomous seafaring drones. And seven of their newest problem sets were posted in the last two weeks to develop projects for network end point inspection, high speed drone and multi-factor authentication, among others. So, the DIUx pipeline is brimming with possibility. And I expect this portfolio will continue to grow – and even more so because of our new presence here in Boston and the new people we recruited to lead it. First is Bernadette Johnson, who many of you know from her years as Chief Technology Officer at MIT's Lincoln Lab. She'll be DIUx's Chief Science Officer, ensuring the technical integrity of its projects and serving as chief liaison to our dozens of DOD and industry labs and other R&D organizations across the department. She'll be joined here by Air Force Reserve Colonel Mike McGinley. In civilian life, Mike is a lawyer specializing in cybersecurity. In uniform, he's been our leader of our Cyber Command's private sector partnership team – until now, that is, because Mike will be going on active duty and serving as military lead for the Boston office. And along with another senior partner to be named later this year, Bernadette and Mike will join Raj and the partners based out west to manage DIUx's efforts across the country. That last part is important. DIUx has to be engaged nationwide because no two innovation ecosystems are alike. Each has its own unique value and expertise. And wherever innovation is happening, we need to be able to tap into it, and Boston is a perfect example of that. In addition to being a hub of east coast economic growth, Boston is a beehive of activity for biotechnology and the biosciences. I think in decades to come, we'll look back and view the I.T. revolution as having been the recent past. The present and the future being also a revolution in the biosciences. We in DOD want to be part of that as well, because even though we don't have quite as much of a legacy here as we do in I.T. and aerospace, we know it can have a tremendous impact on the health and welfare and effectiveness of our troops. So that's part of the future we have to help build – together with our partners in industry and academia, as we always have. And that's why I'm also announcing that DIUx is exploring ways to bring leading minds in the military and DOD to work on bio-defense and biological technology, together with world-class academic researchers, biotech companies and entrepreneurs, including those right here in Boston, like Eric Lander and the Broad Institute and others. And I look forward to their findings, so we can ensure that DOD is fully aware of the biosciences revolution that we're just beginning to live through. Like San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, and so many other places, Boston is a technology hub of great importance – an ecosystem of companies, university and research institutions that exemplifies America's unrivaled innovative culture. And it's especially prominent in the union of biosciences, engineering and data, areas that together could yield new ways to fight infectious diseases, for example, or help develop new materials capable of regenerating, responding to their environment, or learning, evolving – all properties never seen before in human-made substances. Of course, the outcome of this will be just one of many ways we'll measure the success of DIUx. The most important metric will be how much new technology is delivered to the hands of our troops. A high return on investment will mean improved warfighter capability, with innovative technologies being not only demonstrated, but incorporated into regular defense acquisition programs of record. That will require more companies that might not look for defense business getting into our game and also established defense companies having more access to talent. We'll also gauge success in terms of access to technology leaders, the strength of relationships over time, and the ability to use these relationships to advance DOD missions – including the extent to which they take advantage of our on-ramps and off-ramps for technology talent, or perhaps create new ones. And in the long run, we'll look at how many DOD components adopt DIUx practices…particularly nontraditional acquisition mechanisms like the Commercial Solutions Opening. If DIUx is truly successful in catalyzing broader interaction between DOD and non-traditional technology firms as I'm confident it will be, then it will eventually put itself out of business since the department as a whole will be doing what DIUx is doing today. In fact we'd welcome that outcome because DIUx is, after all, an experiment as well as a path finder. We created it so we could try new approaches; learn what works and what doesn't. And iterate until we get it right. And we'll keep iterating together and learning from each other as we go forward. That brings me back to the Defense Innovation Board which I've charged with keeping DOD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, organizations, operations and technology…to support people who innovate, those creative figures in our department who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate. And also to ensure that we're always doing everything we can to stay ahead of potential adversaries. And I have to say that Eric Schmidt has done a great job helping put together the rest of the board. In recent weeks I've announced some of the other members – including Reid Hoffman, the head of LinkedIn; University of Texas Chancellor and former commander of our Special Operations Command, Admiral Bill McRaven; and the noted historian of innovation Walter Isaacson. And today I'm announcing other amazing innovators who will join them. Leaders and thinkers who represent a cross-section of America's most innovative industries and organizations. From the private sector we have Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos; Code for America's founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka: Google's Vice President for Access Services, Broadband and Fiber Network, pioneer Milo Medin; Instagram CEO Marty Levine and United Technologies Senior Vice President for Science and Technology Mike McQuade. And they'll also be joined by several distinguished thinkers about innovation and technology including the Wharton School's Organizational Psychology Professor Adam Grant; Caltech Dynamical Systems and Bioengineer Professor Richard Murray; Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson; and three landmark innovators from right here in Cambridge: Harvard Legal Scholar Cass Sunstein; Computer Theorist, MIT Professor and co-founder of Applied Innovation Danny Hillis, and the President and Founding Director of the Broad Institute, Eric Lander. Some of the board members have already begun their preliminary work. Earlier this month they spent time with airmen in Nevada, sailors in San Diego and today they're meeting with soldiers in Fort Bragg where I'll join tomorrow, and visiting our Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters in Tampa. And they'll continue to work over the summer. At the outset I've given them the very specific task of identifying innovative, private sector, best practices that might be of use to us in the DOD – not unlike our recent ""Hack the Pentagon"" pilot program which invited hackers to help find vulnerabilities in our networks, similar to the Bug Bounties that several of Americas leading tech companies have.  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, ours was the first in the entire federal government. And was so successful we're expanding it to other parts of DOD. This is a way in which you get the white hats to explore your attack surface rather than the black hats. They do it because they love their country or they want the thrill of the reward and it's extremely effective. We'd never done it before and we just did it. Perfect example of the kind of thing I'm looking for for the Innovation Board to recommend. We can't use all the ideas that everybody uses outside of the department, but there are going to be many that we can. Not everything in the private sector will make sense for us because we're always mindful the military isn't a company, it's a profession of arms. And for important reasons, we're not always going to be able to do things the same way, but that doesn't mean we can't look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn for ways we can operate more efficiently. So the board will recommend a first slate of innovative practices by the fall, in time for me to review and determine which ones make sense for us to adopt. All of this is important because as we refocus on maintaining our enduring technological dominance in a new era – which is something we have to do in addition to all that we're doing today – crushing and defeating ISIL, countering Russia, China, maintaining deterrence on the Korean Peninsula, countering Iran's malign influence, everything else we have to do today. In addition to all that, we recognize that DOD, we must be innovative in the future in order to stay ahead of all our competitors. That's why I created the Defense Innovation Board and DIUx in the first place – to challenge our enterprise, to bring in new ideas, to open our doors to new partners and to push our existing bureaucracy to do better rather than keep doing the same things it's always done. As I mentioned earlier, our defense budget for next year makes breakthrough investments in a range of high-end capabilities – investments we need to stay ahead of potential opponents. But just as it's easy for us in DOD to default to the status quo, so also it is easy for Congress to do the same – to buy the same things they've always bought for us or to put up roadblocks to the organizational innovations that we need in order to disrupt and challenge and inspire the rest of our department to change for the better. We can't accomplish what we're trying to do in DOD without a willing partner in Congress, and I'm hopeful Congress will join us in trying to break away from the status quo, break out of our ruts and help keep our military the best and most capable in the world – so we can continue to keep America safe and secure. And I'm grateful to those in our partner committees that have done so, and there are many, and I hope others will get on board quickly. I want to close by saying this is a very exciting time. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And it's also true for those interested in technology, but the intersection of the two is an opportunity-rich environment. Let me explain what I mean by that, though, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face. Right now, as we sit here today, our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our worldwide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do, but we want to do soon. They're also training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression. They're sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations, ensuring that the most consequential region for America's future remains stable, secure and prosperous for all nations. They're standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula and countering Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East. And all the while, they're helping protect our homeland In each of these missions, you can make a difference. Because whether it's machine learning technology that might be able to recognize and block ISIL's barbaric attack plotting on social media…or algorithms to help a self-driving boat track submarines…or biotech research that could one day help our troops recover from injury faster, technology is a critical part of everything we do. And it's critical to addressing every strategic challenge facing us today. That's why DIUx matters. It has to do with our protection and our security, creating a world where people can live their lives, and dream their dreams and give their children a better future. The importance of that never has been lost on the people of Boston. And I'm not just talking about the Minutemen. Think about the many members of Red Sox Nation who went on to serve our entire nation – from Ted Williams, who was a Marine Corps fighter pilot during the Korean War, to our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff today, General Joe Dunford, who was born in South Boston and grew up in Quincy. Think about the Kennedy brothers, stories of heroism and sacrifice during World War II, and then consider the generations of Kennedy School grads who studied under Graham Allison. Think about the technologists at MIT, when decades past, developed computer navigation systems that not only guided ballistic missiles but also landed men on the moon…and then about their contemporaries at Lincoln Labs, Draper, MITRE and Raytheon, who continue to push the boundaries of what's possible. This city is home to a tremendous legacy of service – one that will continue in a new way with DIUx. It's a testament to the fact that Boston has always been a place where great minds and great ideas come together to help advance the safety and security of our country. That's what we do every day in the Department of Defense. Contributing to that mission – helping defend your country and make a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur or a young person can do. And we're grateful to all of you here for your interest in doing that with us. Thank you.

"June 9, 2015","General Taylor, thank you.  Thank you for that wonderful, warm introduction.  And to Lucas, your husband, and all the other spouses and partners of servicemembers and DoD civilians here today – thank you for joining us, and above all, for supporting your loved ones in their service to us. Ladies and gentlemen; leaders of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community; Defense Department leaders, family, friends:  It’s a privilege to stand with you at this fourth annual DoD Pentagon Pride Month event.  Four years after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” – following years and years of gay and lesbian servicemembers having to hide who they are – today we take pride in how they’re free to serve their country openly.  Because we believe in getting to a place where no one serves in silence, and where we treat all our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines with the dignity, and the respect, that they deserve. Looking back, gays and lesbians have long defended our country in uniform – and there are thousands of stories that illustrate their willingness to serve, and to sacrifice. There’s the story, for example, of Army Corporal Lloyd Darling, a twenty-year-old Green Beret who was killed in Vietnam in 1968.  Amid heavy fighting near the Mekong Delta, his unit overrun, Corporal Darling stayed back to cover its retreat to safety.  His fellow soldiers knew he was gay, and they never forgot his courage under fire.  Years later, one of his battle buddies said, and I quote, “he died for us.” There’s also the story of Marine Corps veteran Staff Sergeant Eric Alva, the first American wounded in the Iraq War.  He’d been serving for 13 years with tours in Japan and Somalia when, just hours after the invasion began, a land mine exploded beneath him.  Staff Sergeant Alva gave his right leg serving our country – even as he was required to hide his sexual orientation. And there’s the story of Staff Sergeant Tracy Dice Johnson from the North Carolina National Guard, whose wife, Staff Sergeant Donna Johnson, was killed by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan in 2012.  As a war widow, Tracy continues to serve our country in uniform, and she’s now receiving the same survivor benefits as every other family of America’s fallen patriots. Tracy’s story is emblematic of a deep and abiding commitment in recent years – both in this department, and across the country – to recognizing gay and lesbian marriages and families in full accordance with the law.  And here at the Pentagon, we have been, and remain,  strongly committed to making sure that all our military families and spouses can fully and equally receive the benefits their loved ones have earned – from TRICARE coverage to housing allowances to side-by-side burial at Arlington.  Even in times of resistance – like when some states wouldn’t issue DoD ID cards to same-sex spouses at National Guard facilities – we pushed back.  Not just because our servicemembers and families deserved it, but because everyone’s rights had to be protected. The Department of Defense has made a lasting commitment to living the values we defend – to treating everyone equally – because we need to be a meritocracy.  We have to focus relentlessly on our mission, which means the thing that matters most about a person is what they can contribute to national defense. This is a commitment we must continually renew.  And that’s why, today, I’m proud to announce that the Department of Defense has completed the process for updating its Military Equal Opportunity policy to include sexual orientation – ensuring that the department, like the rest of the federal government, treats sexual-orientation-based discrimination the same way it treats discrimination based on race, religion, color, sex, age, and national origin.  And I’m very proud of the work that the military services have put into this over the last several months.  Because discrimination of any kind has no place in America’s armed forces. Recognizing that our openness to diversity is one of the things that have allowed us to be the best in the world, we must ensure that everyone who’s able and willing to serve has the full and equal opportunity to do so.  And we must start from a position of inclusivity, not exclusivity.  Anything less is not just plain wrong; it’s bad defense policy, and puts our future strength at risk. Embracing diversity and inclusion is critical to recruiting and retaining the force of the future.  Young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best and brightest among them to contribute to our mission of national defense, we have to ourselves be more open, diverse, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. And it’s also vital for developing our military’s future leaders, innovators, and strategists.  While we don’t know where – who they’ll be, or what they’ll look like, we do know they could come from anywhere.  It takes decades to grow our senior military leaders, and today, we can’t afford to close ourselves off to anyone. Moreover, taking active steps towards a military that reflects the rich diversity of America won’t just make us stronger.  It’ll also help us build bridges to our country and to our communities that otherwise aren’t connected enough to those who serve and sacrifice on their behalf – on behalf of this country we all love. As we remind ourselves how diversity and inclusion help make us stronger, we must also remember another reason why they’re important – because they’re part of our national character. In the years past, gay and lesbian servicemembers who desired to serve openly were not aberrant or counter to the ideals that our military has always defended.  They’re the same ideals enshrined in our founding documents – the belief that we’re all created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These words are more than a pinnacle to strive for.  They are real.  And the men and women of this department prove that every day. Indeed, the sacrifices made by Corporal Darling, Staff Sergeant Alva, and Staff Sergeant Johnson – sacrifices of life, limb, and love – are no different from sacrifices that have long been made by Americans in uniform… both men and women, gay and straight alike, each willing to defend this country and its ideals and help make a better world.  And whether they fall in combat, or go on to live a long life, in the end the earth makes no distinction in its embraces of our honored patriots.  And neither should we. So as we celebrate LGBT Pride Month, let us take pride in all who step forward to serve our country – past, present, and future.  As fellow citizens, we honor them.  We thank them.  We cherish them.  Today, and always. Thank you. ",Remarks at LGBT Pride Month Ceremony,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606678/remarks-at-lgbt-pride-month-ceremony/
"May 11, 2016","Good morning, everyone. Thanks everyone for joining me here today and all of us.  Great to be back here in Northern California, even though the weather isn't quite what I was hoping, but it's a lot better than it is in Washington, I can tell you that. Now, look, as some of you have heard me say before, one of my core goals as secretary of defense has been to build, and in some cases to rebuild, the bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and the wonderfully innovative and open technology community of companies, universities that comprise one of America's great strengths. We've had a long history of partnership, working together to develop and advance technologies like the internet, GPS and years before that, communication satellites, the jet engine, all of the benefit of both our society and our security.  But when I came here for the first time in my current job a little over a year ago, I discovered that I was the first Secretary of Defense to visit Silicon Valley in almost 20 years.  So, today, it's a pleasure to be back on my fourth trip in the Bay Area as secretary of defense since then to host all of you here at our startup the Defense Innovation Unit-eXperimental, DIUx, and to share with you some exciting how we're taking this to the next level, and building on the success we've had. Now, when I announced we were creating DIUx here last April, I said it would be the first of the kind unit for us. Staffed by some of DOD's best technologists -- present here -- active duty and reserve personnel. And I met with some of them earlier this morning.  We put our first outpost here in the heart of Silicon Valley to help us connect with leading edge technologies and the entrepreneurs behind them. And we did it because we live in a changing and competitive world. Technology itself is an example of that. When I began my career in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  Today, we're still major sponsors, much more technology is commercial, and the technology base is global. Indeed, technologies once long possessed by only the most formidable militaries, including ours, have not gotten into the hand of previously less capable forces, and even non-state actors.  And nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap with us. So, to stay ahead of those challenges and stay the best, I've been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our fix-sided box, and invest aggressively in change and innovation. One way we're doing that is by pushing the envelope with R&D in new technologies, data science, bio tech, cyber, electronic warfare and many, many others.  In fact, in the budget I've been defending before the Congress over the past few weeks, we're proposing spending nearly $72 billion on research and development next year alone—and for a little local context, that's more than double what Intel, Apple and Google spent on R&D last year combined. The money goes to funding things like making DOD a leader in cyber security, and advancing our commanding lead in undersea warfare, and invest in new strategic approaches to preventing and winning conflicts against 21st century threats, like hybrid warfare, counter-space systems, electronic warfare and anti-access area denial capabilities.  It enables taking long-existing systems and giving them powerful new capabilities -- like the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms and turns it into a flying launchpad for all sorts of advanced, conventional payloads. And among other things those funds support our nation-wide network of private-public Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, also, where we're working with companies, universities and research labs to fund emerging technologies like 3D printing, advanced materials, integrated photonics and digital manufacturing and design.  One brand new one we just announced last month—in Boston, as it turns out—is focused on revolutionary textiles, combining fibers and yarns with things like circuits and LEDs, and solar cells, electronic sensors and other capabilities to create fabrics that can see, hear, sense, communicate, store energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, change color and much more.  And we announced last fall right here at Moffett Field in fact, a center focused on flexible hybrid electronics, which will make it possible to seamlessly print lightweight, flexible structural integrity sensors right onto the surfaces of ships, bridges, cars, aircraft and so on.  So these are just a few examples of how we're intent on expanding the boundaries of what's possible in technology. And another way we're investing in innovation is through people. I call it on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow between DOD and the tech sector in both directions. That way, more of America's brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense. And our outstanding military and civilian leaders and technologists across the DOD and in the innovative defense industry that supports us already, will themselves be able to interact with, learn from and explore new ways to innovate with innovative ecosystems like this one. One example of this is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in technologists ranging from large companies like Google, to startups like Shopify, for what we call a tour of duty. These are great people. These are talented people who are coming into DOD just for a year or two, maybe one project. But they make a lasting contribution to us and our mission, and also experience being part of something bigger than themselves. They're helping us to solve some really important problems.  DDS, for example, improved DOD's data-sharing with the Veterans Administration, so we can help veterans get faster access to the benefits they've earned. They're working with a team that's developing a better and more secure next generation GPS to be used by billions of people around the world, military and civilian alike.  They have a team right now improving our systems for tracking sexual assaults, so we can understand the data in a more meaningful way and then do more to eliminate these crimes from our ranks, and ultimately to be more transparent with advocates and others.  And later this month, they'll work with a team to pilot one of the largest deployments of a commercial cloud computing platform, largest ever, to help streamline how we manage travel orders and reservations for DOD's nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, making it easier to use and more efficient of taxpayer dollars. The wizards at DDS also helped us invite vetted hackers to test our cybersecurity under a pilot program called ""Hack the Pentagon."" You may have seen this in the news over the last few weeks. Sounds crazy to a lot of people, right? But as many of you know, this is actually something we're stealing from the private sector. It's similar to the bug bounties that many of the leading tech companies have. But this is the first one ever in the U.S. federal government and it's in the Defense Department.  And while it's still ongoing, I can tell you it's already exceeded all of our expectations. Over 1,400 hackers registered and so far have discovered more than 80 bugs that qualify for a bounty. All this helping us be more secure, and as you'll see in coming weeks, at a fraction of the price. Meanwhile, an additional way we're investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector in technology communities here in Silicon Valley and in America's many other great innovation hubs. And this, of course, is where DIUx comes in. Since opening its doors eight months ago, DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the Valley. And even better, it's made great progress in putting commercially-based innovation into the hands of America's soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. And so now, it's time to build on that.  Already, the DIUx team has made connections with more than 500 entrepreneurs and firms. They've hosted many highly-attended forums, connecting innovators here with senior DOD leaders and a full range of Pentagon funding sources, fellowships, rotations programs. And they've created a funding pipeline for nearly two dozen technology projects - spanning everything from wind-powered drones to data analytic tools - that will help address some of our most pressing operation challenges.  And I had the opportunity just a couple of months ago to take a look at a number of those really exciting projects. Exciting and consequential. One of the most important things since staring DIUx is how much we've learned over the last eight months - not only about what works, but also what can make it work better, by being agile, throwing out what doesn't work, moving on.  I believe that doing business with the tech industry forces DOD to look ourselves in the mirror, which is healthy for us, healthy for any organization. And in this case, it's helped us identify not only our successes, but also our shortcomings, both in how we engage with tech companies here and in the tools we use to accelerate the uptake of technology in the Department. So armed with this knowledge, we're taking a page straight from the Silicon Valley playbook: We're iterating rapidly to make DIUx even better. As a result of all of this great experience and a view of technologies and the world's imperative to stay agile, today we're launching DIUx 2.0, and there's several new features I'd like to tell you about. The first new feature is that DIUx will be a nationwide release—we're not just iterating, we're scaling. Since creating DIUx, it's become even clearer to me how valuable this model is, this concept is of DIUx. And because America has many geographic centers of technical excellence, we already intend to open a second DIUx office to be located in the innovation hub of Boston, and there'll be more. Second, we're upgrading DIUx's processing power. In our budget for the coming year, we've requested $30 million in new funding to direct towards non-traditional companies with emerging commercially- based technologies that meet our military's needs.  With co-investment from the military services, this number is really just a starting point. And to channel these resources into systems that will give our future warfighters a battlefield advantage, DIUx will exercise all avenues to fund promising technologies, including merit-based prize competitions, incubator partnerships and targeted R&D efforts. The third new feature of DIUx 2.0 is an operating system upgrade, because the missions now assigned to DIUx are far broader than any one person could ever see. I'm establishing a partnership style leadership structure for DIUx, one that includes technologists, investors and business executives.  Here, we're taking yet another page from the Silicon Valley playbook, making leadership structure at DIUx as flat as any company here. Let me introduce some of them to you. First is Raj Shah, the new Managing Partner of DIUx. You'll hear more from him in a few minutes. Now, for Raj, those of you who don't know him, he's a National Guardsman and F-16 pilot, a combat veteran, but he is also been co-founder and CEO of a very successful technology startup. Next is Isaac Taylor -- where's Isaac? Isaac right there, there's Isaac -- who joins DIUx from Google, where he was head of operations for Google X, the company's R&D facility, back when Google X was new. I remember it.  There, he worked on Google Glass, on the self-driving cars, and virtual reality technologies and many other of Google's programs. There's also Vishaal Hariprasad, right there. You can see him; you can't pronounce him, but you can see him.  Right, Vishaal? First name is easy. Air Force Reserve Captain, combat veteran, Bronze Star recipient, who co-founded a successful cyber security startup and served as head of threat intelligence at a large, public company. And there’s Chris Kirchhoff, who served as a civilian adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and is a lead author of the White House's Big Data Report, and is Director of Strategic Planning at the National Security Council. This impressive team of partners will be joined by an equally impressive team of reservists, who will serve at DIUx in a first-of-its-kind reserve unit.  America's reservists, our citizen-soldiers, can provide unique value in this field, as they do in so many areas. Given the fact that many of these patriots are tech industry leaders when they're not on duty for us in DOD.  And I'm pleased to say that here, they'll be led by Naval Reserve Commander Doug Beck, a decorated combat veteran - where did he go? There you are - a decorated combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who in his civilian life is Apple's Vice President for the Americas and Northeast Asia, reporting directly to Tim Cook. As we move to this new leadership model, we're also upgrading the I/O, so to speak, between DIUx and our operations back in the Pentagon. Going forward, DIUx will report directly to me.  I can't afford to have everybody do that, but this is to signify the importance I attach to this mission, and also the importance of speedy decision making.  And I'm committed to that in DIUx, and I'm going to do my part very directly to make sure that occurs.  And I'll work in close coordination with my Deputy Bob Work -- excellent deputy -- and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Paul Selva. And to maximize the rapid uptake of promising technology, I'm directing DIUx to work closely with DOD's rapid acquisition cells and R&D community. DIUx will be a test-bed for new kinds of contracting with start-up firms; they'll work quickly to execute time-sensitive acquisition programs, and they'll move at the speed of business. We know how fast companies run here, and in other tech hubs around the country. And we expect DIUx 2.0 to run alongside of them. Before I turn it over to Raj, I have to say that DIUx wouldn't be here today without George Duchack, its founding director. We're grateful to him. I'm extremely grateful to George for launching just a path-breaking initiative. Getting DIUx 1.0 off the ground; trying out a whole lot of new things is exactly what I wanted; identifying potential partners.  And now, we have the opportunity to build on his success. And George has the opportunity to now work more for us in a new role, and his continuing service to our Department. What I've done is ask him to leverage his experiences here to expand innovative practices in other areas of DOD's Research & Engineering empire there in the Department of Defense, which I used to run. And George is going to help bring some of what he learned to that. So George, thank you. And I should say, and I had a chance to talk to them earlier today, all the wonderful people who came on board in 1.0 and are staying with us; absolutely fantastic group of people here. I'm very proud of you and very grateful to you. And I want all of you to know that we're committed to growing the circle of entrepreneurs and investors interested in our mission. And we'll keep iterating together, and learning from each other as we go forward. That's one reason, by the way, that I recently created a new Defense Innovation Board to advise me and future defense secretaries on how to continue building bridges to the technology community, and how we can continue to change to be more competitive.  And I'm very pleased that Alphabet's Eric Schmidt agreed to serve as the board's first chairman - stay tuned, by the way, in coming weeks for who else will be joining him - And I'm looking very much forward to hearing what they'll be doing. As I've said before, this is a very exciting time. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And that's also true for those interested in technology, but when the intersection of the two is truly an opportunity-rich environment. Let me explain what I mean by that, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face. Right now, our men and women in uniform are working partners from our worldwide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do, but we want to do soon.  They're training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression. They're sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific, ensuring that the most consequential region for America's future remains stable, secure and prosperous for all nations. They're standing guard daily, nightly on the Korean Peninsula, and countering Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East. And all the while, they're helping protect our homeland. In each of these missions, you can make a difference. Because whether it's algorithms that help a self-driving boat track submarines; or cyber defenses that guard our networks from intruders, or biotech research in developing new materials that might be able to regenerate -- something never -- a kind never seen before in human-made substances; or smaller electronics that lighten the load of our troops in the field; or 3D printed micro-drones that can be kicked onto the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach.9, technology is a critical part of everything we do.  And it's critical to addressing every strategic challenge facing us today. And that's why DIUx matters. It has to do with our protection and our security, creating a world where our fellow citizens can go to school, dream their dreams, live their lives, one day give their children a better future. Helping defend your country and making a better world is one of the noblest things a business leader, a technologist, an entrepreneur, or a young person can do. And we're grateful to all of you for your interest in doing that with us. Now, let me turn it over to DIUx's new Managing Partner, Raj Shah.

"April 28, 2016","All right.  Well, listen, good afternoon. Let me just start off by expressing my thanks to each and every one of you in this room, for I know each and every one of you is making a contribution to this critical mission.  And I thank you because wherever sexual assault occurs – whether it's on the front lines or here at home – it not only undermines our values, it undercuts our ability to execute our mission to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  Honor and trust are the lifeblood of the profession of military arms.  Every sexual assault is an attack on those values.  So, too, are acts of retaliation against those who report these crimes. The theme of this year's Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is ""Know your part, do your part,"" and that's more than just a slogan.  It's one of our missions.  And let me make one thing clear, I view retaliation associated with reporting sexual assault or harassment as unacceptable conduct.  It's a direct threat to the health of our force. We must ensure that as a Department, we're doing everything we can to provide the proper protections and support for those who come forward to report sexual assault.  To that end, after last year's annual report on sexual assault in the military, I mandated a Department-wide retaliation strategy to improve the way we support service members who experience retaliation from reporting this crime, while aligning prevention and response efforts across the Services. And this was something new, and it to me reflects something that I'm proud of, which is in retaliation, we came to recognize yet another dimension of this scourge.  And we're taking it on, and that's what this step represents.  There will be more in the future as we learn more and we get better.  We've got to get better.  But I'm not proud that retaliation occurs, but I'm proud that we recognized it.  While there's much work that remains to be done to eliminate this overall scourge, sexual assault, from our military, today we're taking an important step with the release of this strategy.  And there are copies of the strategy here.  It will be posted today on the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office's website at SAPR.mil. And I want to thank General Nichols, wherever she is -- General Nichols and I, I should say, go back a long ways, in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and couldn't be -- have more confidence in your leadership on this important mission. The report, as you'll see, provides a framework for strengthening support for those who experience retaliation in connection with reporting sexual assault or harassment, and for clarifying the retaliation response process.  In taking these actions, we will uphold our commitment to survivors and reporters.  And I hope we will also influence those considering whether to make a report, whether to do it or not. We're also here today to recognize servicemembers and civilians who not only know their part and do their part, but who serve as models in their response to sexual assault across the services, at all levels of responsibility.  They've promoted an environment where sexual assault is neither tolerated nor ignored.  In different ways, they have reinforced a culture of prevention, accountability, dignity and respect.  And I'm proud of each and every one of them. Sergeant First Class Raquel Mendoza knew her part and went far beyond the call of duty to strengthen our force.  She created a triage decision tree that ensured anyone standing guard was trained to properly handle sexual assault when it occurred, notify the responsible parties, assist in the preservation of evidence, and protect the rights of the survivor. Her decision tree is so effective that it's now being replicated across the entire U.S. Army.  She also established an on-based mentorship program that affirms the dignity and experiences of survivors, raising awareness and galvanizing the Fort Carson community to do its part against sexual violence. Ms. Deborah Drucker helped to shift the expectations and perceived norms within the submarine community to integrate and welcome female crew members.  She also confronted the long-held stereotype that all survivors of sexual assault are female and all perpetrators are male.  She encouraged members of her community to consider male as well as female survivors, which is vital to changing environments and behaviors. Ms. Jacqueline Maxwell demonstrated extraordinary compassion for the survivors of sexual assault at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and determination to improve how we teach our personnel about sexual assault.  Her efforts led to the first-ever sexual assault prevention and response proclamation of support by unit and base commanders.  From the ground up, she inspired military leaders to commit to a total team effort to prevent sexual assault. Captain Elizabeth Bellow made sure that our men and women across AFRICOM had an advocate and the resources they needed across 15 geographically separated operating locations supporting over 7,000 service members.  Through education, orientation or frequent outreach, she helped establish evacuation procedures to transport survivors from across the command to locations with certified providers of forensic exams. Sergeant First Class Melinda Heikkinen -- did I pronounce that right?  Melinda, where are you?  How did I do?  We'll have another chance in a minute when you get your reward. Anyway, you traveled more than 3,000 miles as a sexual assault response coordinator for the Washington Army National Guard to advocate for survivors. Where did she go?  She's back there -- there you are; there you are…But in all seriousness, in the process of doing that, she created a policy for victim care and response that enabled all restricted reporting cases to move to unrestricted reporting -- all.  This policy encouraged a cultural shift allowing survivors to be comfortable to report assault and receive compassionate care. Ms. Simone Hall is the final member of our force I'd like to recognize today.  She used cutting-edge technology to ensure that 6,500 military and civilian employees of the U.S. Coast Guard had instant access to sexual assault prevention and response services.  She is dedicated to establishing an environment within her service that promotes dignity and respect for every individual, with the ultimate goal of eliminating sexual assault. There they are, these six individuals, trailblazers.  They know their part.  They do their part.  And they're doing whatever it takes to fight against sexual assault in our military ranks.  They're a model for all of us in the Department. While we celebrate these six remarkable individuals, we know our work is not finished. And in that vein, I'm pleased to make one more announcement today.  The Defense Digital Service is combining forces with our Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office to launch a project that will improve the systems that underlie our reporting databases.  This is important, because this will allow for more streamlined, timely and accurate reporting.  It will also reduce the burden on our dedicated sexual assault response coordinators and investigators, a big burden I know from talking to them, allowing them to spend more time with survivors. This project will help the Department understand sexual assault data in a more meaningful way, also ultimately leading to more transparency between DOD advocates and others invested in this critical mission. So, to the six women with us today, I'm so proud of you and the work you've already done.  By choosing to defend your country and make a better world, you've dedicated your lives to one of the noblest things a person can do.  And by stepping forward to look out for and protect your fellow service members, you help ensure that the force of tomorrow can be as great as the force of today. Thank you for that. And now we'll recognize each one of you individually.

"Nov. 13, 2017","Minister Izoria, Ambassador Bakradze, military officers, members of the delegation, welcome to the Pentagon. Minister, it is good to meet you again after seeing each other last at the NATO-Georgia Commission in Brussels in February. And Deputy Chikovani, we were together in Kyiv in August. It is good to have you here. Your representatives are always welcome here.  We meet this week as our two countries prepare for celebratory feasts next Thursday – St. George’s day in Georgia and Thanksgiving here. I wish your nation a very happy holiday in honor of your patron saint – immortalized as a defender of the Georgian people.  This year marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Georgia & the U.S., and 2018 will mark the 10th anniversary of the Bucharest Pledge that Georgia will one day become a NATO member. Our countries have stood by one another in friendship and solidarity since Georgia chose to join the community of democratic nations a quarter century ago.  This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the Russian-Georgian war. As Vice President Pence said during his visit to Tbilisi this summer, “America stands with Georgia.” This commitment is underpinned by our nations’ shared values of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and respect for the rules-based international order.  Minister Izoria, your Prime Minister’s affirmation to stand with us in Afghanistan until the last U.S. soldier leaves is a powerful and deeply appreciated signal of our nations’ friendship and strategic partnership.  We recognize your nation as the largest per capita and non-NATO force contributor to the mission. With 871 troops continuously deployed, Georgia is an example for all. We honor the 32 Georgian soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of this cause, and your wounded, many of whom have suffered grievous injuries in our fight against terrorism.  As we look to the future, the U.S. strongly supports Georgia’s devotion to strengthening and modernizing its military capabilities with 2.2% of your GDP dedicated to defense spending. This shows your commitment to your military defense. Your military reforms are well-tuned to significantly improve the Georgian military’s increasing effectiveness, and we endorse them.  Minister, members of the delegation, I look forward to discussing our efforts to work together. Thank you for making the trip. It is good to see you, and you are most welcome here.  # # # ",Remarks at Bilateral Meeting with Georgian Minister of Defense Izoria,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1370696/remarks-at-bilateral-meeting-with-georgian-minister-of-defense-izoria/
"Feb. 17, 2015","To all Department of Defense personnel: I am honored to become your Secretary of Defense.  I am proud to lead men and women who devote their lives to the highest calling – the defense of our nation.  And I am grateful to follow in the footsteps of Secretary Hagel, one of our nation’s most honorable and conscientious public servants. We live in challenging times – times that demand leadership and focus.  And starting today, I will be calling on each and every one of you to help carry out three top priorities. Our first priority is helping the President make the best possible national security decisions for protecting our country – and then implementing those decisions with our department’s long-admired excellence. We confront a turbulent and dangerous world: continuing turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, and the malignant and savage terrorism emanating from it; an ongoing conflict in Afghanistan; a reversion to archaic security thinking in parts of Europe; tensions in the Asia-Pacific; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and intensifying threats in cyberspace. In addressing these challenges, I have pledged to provide the President my most candid strategic advice.  I will count on your experience and expertise as I formulate that advice.  I will also ensure the President receives candid professional military advice. But as we tackle the many threats to our national security, we must never lose sight of our nation’s enduring strengths – or of the opportunities to make a brighter future and better world for our children.  The United States remains the strongest and most resilient nation on earth.  Because of you, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  We have friends and allies in every corner of the world, while our adversaries have few.  We have long possessed the world’s most dynamic and innovative economy.  And our values, principles, and leadership continue to inspire hope and progress around the world. Safeguarding America’s security and global leadership will depend on another of my main priorities: ensuring the strength and health of you who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, civilians, and contractors all around the world. I will do that by focusing on the well-being, safety, and dignity of each of you and your families.  I will ensure your training and equipment are as superb as you are.  And I pledge to make decisions about sending you into harm’s way with the greatest reflection and utmost care – because this is my highest responsibility as Secretary of Defense. Honoring all these commitments also requires us to focus on building the force of the future, which is my third priority. We must steer through the turmoil of sequestration, which imposes wasteful uncertainty and risk to our nation’s defense.  We must balance all parts of our defense budget so that we continue to attract the best people – people like you; so that there are enough of you to defend our interests around the world; and so that you are always well-equipped and well-trained to execute your critical mission. To win support from our fellow citizens for the resources we need, we must show that we can make better use of every taxpayer dollar.  That means a leaner organization, less overhead, and reforming our business and acquisition practices. It also means embracing the future – and embracing change. We must be open to change in order to operate effectively in an increasingly dynamic world; to keep pace with advances in technology; and to attract new generations of talented and dedicated Americans to our calling. I first arrived at the Pentagon more than three decades ago, and have had the privilege of serving 11 Secretaries of Defense in Democratic and Republican administrations.  I took the oath of office this morning because I love our country and am devoted to you who defend it.  And I am committed to our fundamental mission: the defense of our nation. I look forward to leading and serving alongside you at this extraordinary moment in our nation’s history. May God bless you and your families, and may God bless America.

"Nov. 14, 2014","To the men and women of the Department of Defense: Earlier this year, following revelations about troubling lapses of integrity in our nation’s nuclear forces, I ordered comprehensive internal and external reviews of our entire nuclear enterprise.  Today at the Pentagon, I announced the reviews' findings and what we are doing to address them - ranging from changes that involve oversight, policies, and culture, to changes that require more funding and resources for the nuclear mission - but I wanted to send a personal message to all of you. Our nuclear deterrent plays a critical role in assuring U.S. national security, and it is DoD's highest priority mission.  No other capability we have is more important. Our nuclear forces stand alone in being able to deter nuclear attack on the United States and our allies. For too long, we have overlooked career paths, compensation, infrastructure, and small unit leadership that are mission-critical in the nuclear force. That is changing. It will continue to change.  What you do every day is critically important to America's national security. Over the last year, I have heard from many of our people in the nuclear force. I visited missileers at F.E. Warren Air Force Base and called launch control officers underground at Malmstrom. I visited nuclear weapons maintainers at Kirtland Air Force Base, met with STRATCOM senior and junior officers at Offutt, and met with submariners aboard the ballistic missile submarine U.S.S. Tennessee at Kings Bay.  Today, I am visiting bomber crews, missileers, and support teams at Minot Air Force Base. Despite sometimes insufficient resources and manpower, our airmen, sailors, and Marines have stretched themselves to maintain, guard, and operate the nuclear enterprise every day. They deserve our thanks. To all these individuals and their colleagues across our nuclear enterprise:  You are the heirs to a proud legacy, and it is because of you that our nuclear enterprise is safe, secure, and effective today. We will expect excellence, and the President will expect excellence, because the American people expect excellence. In turn, we will ensure you have the resources and support you need - and we will always be unspeakably grateful to you for carrying out this vital mission. Thank you all, and your families, for what you do for our country.

"Jan. 28, 2016","I assume everybody has gotten dug out of the snow successfully.  But any way, thanks for being here, really appreciate it. You know that over the last several months I've been laser-focused here, we all have been laser-focused.  And I've spoken many times on accelerating the campaign to defeat ISIL, defeating it first where it took root in Iraq and Syria, and elsewhere in which it has metastasized, and protecting our people and our homeland. And what we must remain absolutely focused on delivering ISIL a lasting defeat, we do not for a moment lose sight of America's leading role around the world -- and additionally, on certain long-term imperatives for this great Department of Defense, and particularly, what we must do to build the force for the future. When I became Secretary of Defense, I made a commitment to building America's force of the future, an all-volunteer military that will defend our nation for generations to come.  I've proudly stated that today's military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. But that excellence is not a birthright.  It has to be earned again and again by investing in what matters most, which is our people.  By drawing from the best America has to offer and from the broadest possible pool of talent, we can ensure that the force of tomorrow remains as great as the force of today. That's why I announced in December that we're opening up all remaining combat missions to women, so that 100 percent of Americans who can meet our exacting standards can contribute to our mission.  That's why in recent years, we allowed gay men and women to serve openly.  That's why we're developing new approaches and incentives for recruitment, so that we can reach and draw from a broader cross section of Americans. And clearly, fairness is important, but always, always the mission effectiveness of our force comes first.  We are not Google.  We are not Walmart.  We're warfighters. But that doesn't mean we should not be challenging ourselves just like the private sector.  To modernize our workplace and workforce, to retain and attract the top talent we need, so that our force can remain the best for future generations. As you know, last year, I asked my team to come up with a set of proposals and reforms to help us build the force of the future.  The military Service Chiefs and secretaries, supported by one of the department's most innovative minds, [Acting] Under Secretary Brad Carson, have brought their ideas to bear in working groups led by the Deputy Secretary of Defense Work and Vice Chairman Selva to get their input on ideas, analyze the impacts of proposals on mission effectiveness and integrate feedback. And of course, I want to say especially Secretary of the Navy Mabus has been a leader in so many of these issues. I introduced our first link to the force to the future in November, a set of reforms that help connect our men and women in the military in more structured and career-advancing ways to our most creative industries and to our culture of innovation.  And as I said then, that was just a beginning. Today, I'm announcing the next link in the force of the future:  a set of several initiatives with a singular focus -- strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life. These reforms focus on family issues that impact three critical areas for the force of the future:  recruiting, retention, and career and talent management. It's something that's been said so often before, but is so true.  While you recruit a service member, you retain a family.  So what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we're a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit is absolutely -- absolutely essential to our future strength. We all know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force -- 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages -- 84,000 -- with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other. While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known.  Among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top. And we know that, at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services. We know that a high level of work -- excuse me -- of family conflict -- work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service. To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work/life balance. These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly 4 in 5 of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce -- twice the rate of baby boomers. These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly. We will address these generational changes in how we continue to recruit, retain and attract the best America has to offer by setting a more competitive standard across our joint force for parental leave, by making quality child care services more accessible and more flexible, by helping our men and -- men and women meet current career demands while preserving their ability to start a family down the road, and by making an option available for troops to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice, at their commander's discretion, for an additional service obligation. Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries. The first initiative I'll outline today involves providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force.  Today, I am setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, doubling this benefit from 6 weeks when I entered office. This puts DOD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  Certainly, offering a more generous standard for maternity leave is imperative for attracting and retaining talent. We see the same phenomenon year after year -- women at peak ages for starting a family leave the military at the highest rates.  Additionally, medical data also indicate this offering 12 weeks of maternity leave is also imperative to military mothers themselves. They show -- these medical data show that spending more time with infants and recovering from their pregnancies is, as a medical matter, very valuable to mothers to facilitate recovery, feeding, bonding, and more. Private-sector data also strongly suggests a direct benefit on retention, and that employees who have access to and make use of parental leave perform better when they return to work.  They stay with their organizations longer and are able to make greater contributions. I reviewed studies, surveys and inputs from across the services, and evidence and perspectives from all parties concerned with this issue, and particularly the views of our Joint Chiefs of Staff.  I've taken time to consider the diversity views and different data points on this important subject.  I concluded that 12 weeks of maternity leave across all of the force establishes the right balance between offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force. And I don't take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, but I believe that we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we're providing across the joint force.  And I should just note that for Navy mothers that are currently pregnant, we'll ensure that they can take those 18 weeks of leave. And we also realize, whether in raising a family or caring for an infant, this is not just a mother's responsibility, which is why this year, we will seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  For those who want to become dads, or are about to, I want them to know this leave is available to them and I want them to make full use of it. Second, and next, to build the force of the future, improvements to quality of life for military families must extend beyond the first critical months of parenthood.  With the investments we're making in child care, we will provide the men and women of our military greater flexibility to meet the demands of modern family life. Now many within our force already benefit from some of the highest quality child care available, and DOD subsidizes the cost of child care to ensure that it's affordable across the force, no matter what your rank.  It's one of the many areas where the military already stands apart.  But today, nearly half of all military families have to rely on an additional child care provider to meet their needs, in part because the hours we provide don't match their demanding schedules. In some respects our child care options today reflect the needs of a different era, of a time when, for the vast majority of military families, only one parent worked outside the home.  That's a problem we need to address, and as we looked at this issue over the past nine months, we saw a link between dissatisfaction with child care and difficulties with retention.  Whether for single parents, for families where both parents work outside the home or for every mother or father in our military, child care hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands. Based on feedback, therefore, from surveys and pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase child care access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with child care they can rely on, from before reveille  to after taps, we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  We show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals. Third, we can also make relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breast feeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, I am requiring that a mother's room be made available at every facility with more than 50 women, which means the establishment of some 3,600 rooms across the country. This is an issue, by the way, that my friend Sheryl Sandberg first illuminated for me, and I'm pleased to see that with these investments, we'll make sure that we provide better options and choices for mothers across the force. Fourth, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time, as is here as elsewhere, preserving our force's effectiveness. Data and surveys show that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness. Only in extreme circumstances are such arrangements currently made.  But for a family who has a son or daughter who receives treatment at a particular hospital or who suffers from a particular disability, remaining longer in location where their specialized high-quality care can make a world of difference.  Other families want to remain in one place longer to allow a son or daughter to finish high school in one place with friends, teachers and teams they're close to.  Or perhaps to be close to grandparents or other family.  These are all important. When the needs of the force permit a service member to stay at their current location, we will empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation. Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk, of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  It's clear that the benefits we offer our troops can better account for this. We can help our men and women preserve their ability to start a family, even if they suffer certain combat injuries.  That's why we will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active duty service members -- a benefit that will help provide men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers. Particularly, for women who are mid-grade officers and enlisted personnel, this benefit will demonstrate that we understand the demands upon them and want to help them balance commitments to force and commitments to family.  We want to retain them in our military. We're also committed to continuing to look at how we can provide advanced reproductive technologies like IVF to a wider population.  Today, we provide reduced cost treatment at six locations across the country, and we will study how to broaden this coverage in the future. By providing this additional peace of mind for our young service members, we provide our force greater confidence about their future, while providing one more tool to make the military a more family-friendly employer; an employer that honors the desire of our men and women to commit themselves completely to their careers, or to serve courageously in combat, while preserving their ability to have children in the future. There's no reform that we can make that will meet the particular circumstances of every military family, and ultimately there is no way to separate service from sacrifice.  Military service will require uncommon dedication in every generation, including the coming generation.  But I'll mention just one story that helps capture the commitment of our service members and the complexity of starting and supporting a military family today. When they met in Japan, Lieutenant Jack Eaves was a young surface warfare officer.  And Lieutenant Hannah Foster was serving as a judge advocate general in the Navy, having graduated from Princeton and Harvard, and worked with Justice Kagan. Within days of first meeting, they were instantly taken with one another.  In the next months, you might say their relationship developed quickly.  But as Hannah said, quote, ""In the Navy, it's kinds of accelerated.  You have to make decisions.  You never know what will happen with your life,"" unquote. She was right to prepare for uncertainty, because a few months after they met, the horrific Japanese earthquake struck, and both were called to provide assistance at sea.  And Jack subsequently had been ordered home in May.  They didn't know when they'd ever see each other. In an exchange between ships, over e-mails, they made up their minds -- they decided to get married. Now, it wasn't traditional, and it wasn't easy, but they made it possible, and making wedding arrangements was just the beginning.  They both wanted to start a family.  But planning for when they would be in the same place and when they would be at stations long enough to be rated by commanding officers didn't give them much time.  They overcame challenges of distance and their limited months limited months together to make it work, and today, they have two wonderful children. Hannah has recalled those critical moments when they were serving offshore, wondering, quote, ""how long we'd be out to sea,"" unquote.  She was referring to their ships, but also their relationship, and whether something enduring was possible. Hannah and Jack made it possible.  They became lifelong partners.  They have two kids, and their family's off to a great start.  But in the life of their young family and the life of their young careers, they could have used a little more support, and the same is true for so many of our military families. At each stage of the game, Hannah and Jack had to worry about promotion boards, rating periods and additional calculations which made the first year of family life even more complex. As we introduce today's reforms, our calculation is quite simple.  We want our people to be able to balance two of the most solemn commitments they could ever make:  a commitment to serve their country and a commitment to start and support a family. And whether they're soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines, with the investments we introduce today, we want to ensure that no military family finds itself at sea. We want to make sure our troops have our support, and first and foremost that our force remains effective and always ready.  With what I've announced today, I believe our military will be better prepared for the future, and my successor's successors will continue to inherit the finest fighting force the world has ever known. We will become a more powerful magnet for the high-end talent we will need in the coming generation.  We will make it easier to retain the top talent we have and to develop future leaders. We'll improve the quality of life for our families and enhance our mission effectiveness.  We'll ensure the force of the future remains as great as the force of today.  And I assure you there'll be more initiatives to come. So thank you very much.  I look forward to answering your questions.

"Sept. 29, 2016","Good morning, gang. Good morning, every one. Let me start by saying how great it is to be in San Diego.  And I appreciate that this beautiful city here has been a community that’s welcomed our military for many years.  We don’t take it for granted.  And we’re grateful to you.  Thank you. Where’d Mike go?  Here we are…on no, no, please sit down.  Thank you, Mike.  One of the many ways Mike has given me help over the long time we’ve known each other.  You all are lucky to have Mike in command out here.  Secretary of Defense isn’t a bad title but “Air Boss” is a great title.  And he does a very good job of it. Also, Doug Verissimo, Doug, V8, your Captain.  But I’m here to talk to you, all of you, the sailors of the Carl Vinson.  First to thank you for everything you do every day. And then to say something about the strategic meaning of what you’re accomplishing for our nation and our world here. For over three decades, the men and women of the Gold Eagle have done what is the noblest thing a person – each and every one of you – can do with your lives, which is defend our great country and make a better world for our children.  And today, you – and the rest of what is the finest fighting force the world has ever known, America’s – are addressing squarely the five major, immediate, evolving challenges we face as a nation in our security. First, we’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific…more on that in a moment, where China is rising, which is fine, but sometimes behaving aggressively, which is not.  Indeed, we’re also strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And every day, and as we sit here right now, we’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL, destroying the fact and the idea that there can be a state based upon this evil ideology, first in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it metastasizes around the world, even as we continue to help protect our people here in at home. Now, today, I want to speak with you about our strategy with respect to what is the single most consequential region for America’s future: which is the Asia-Pacific.  And I want to echo what the Air Boss said a moment ago, which is what we all believe: your mission here is critically important to our country, to our security and that of our friends and allies. I spent the past couple of days with some of the thousands of men and women, military and civilian, who contribute to our nuclear deterrence mission.  And I’ll tell you the same thing I told them: even if your mission – whether it’s at a missile silo in North Dakota or on an aircraft carrier in what is today the relatively peaceful Asia-Pacific – isn’t in the headlines everyday –as I see it, we’re in real trouble when what you do gets in the headlines – your mission here is one of fundamental strategic importance to our country, and that it’s not in the headlines is a tribute to your success – we need you to keep it that way.  Remember: this region, with half of humanity, half of the world’s economy, is the single most consequential region for America’s future – and indeed for the world’s. Indeed, the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, which President Obama announced five years ago, is a critical national commitment.  It includes diplomatic, economic, and military components all to ensure – at a time of dramatic political, economic, and security change in the region – that the Asia-Pacific remains a place where every nation can rise and prosper. To do that, as all of you know, nations are going to need security.  People can’t have all the other things that make life meaningful if they’re not safe.  That’s essential for the Asia-Pacific’s continued progress.  And that’s our charge – and your charge.  DoD’s component of the rebalance – the work you and your fellow American servicemembers carry out with strength, commitment, and principle  – will help this dynamic region realize its potential in that principled future. The good news is, we don’t have to do this alone.  We’re strong, but we also have many friends, partners, and allies in the region – part of a burgeoning principled and inclusive security network in the Asia-Pacific.  This afternoon, I’m flying on to Hawaii to meet with ten of those partners, my counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, to discuss how we’re partnering together in new ways to ensure security and stability in that vital corner of the cast Asia-Pacific. So before I depart, I want to remind you – who are at the center of everything out here, and at the center of all our minds back in Washington – about all that DoD is doing to operationalize the rebalance – to ensure we have the people, payloads, platforms, the war plans, and the partners to continue bolstering security in the region for decades to come.  And I also want to share with you the first steps we’ll be taking – that you’ll be taking – in the next phase, the next phase, of the rebalance, our third, to catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s principled and inclusive security network and ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where every nation can rise and prosper. That’s been America’s objective and America’s practice since World War II.  In fact, tomorrow I’ll host the Southeast Asian defense ministers aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.  The “Mighty Mo,” as it’s called, is most famous for being the site 71 years ago this month of the signing ceremony that ended World War II.  At the end of the session, General Douglas MacArthur, who presided over the ceremony, said, “Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world, and that God will preserve it always.” With that prayer, and in the decades since, millions of American men and women serving in uniform across the Asia-Pacific have helped restore the region and preserve its stability.  Every port call and every flight hour, every exercise and operation, and every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine has made important contributions to the Asia-Pacific’s security.  Those Americans – including all of you – have also helped uphold and defend important principles, like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. And we’ve seen how U.S.-enabled security and these principles have helped countries throughout the region make incredible progress.  Think about it… first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, rose and prospered, and today, China and India do the same.  That progress has produced incredible changes in the region: populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have taken hold, economies are becoming more interconnected, and military spending is increasing. Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured since that day on the Missouri: we still want peace, stability, and progress in the Asia-Pacific.  But as the region has changed, our approach has had to change along with it.  That’s why five years ago President Obama announced in Australia that the United States was going to launch the rebalance, to quote him, “play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.” That last word – future – is important.  The rebalance is about the future.  With it, we’re not trying to stop or rewind the clock in the Asia-Pacific, for we know that in the decades after World War II, amid the region’s ruins and unhealed wounds dating back to that war and even to the decades before, not every nation got the opportunity to fully realize its potential.  That legacy – along with the region’s many internal rifts and historical tensions of which you’re very familiar – must be overcome.  And the great nations and peoples of the Asia-Pacific must each be able to realize their full potential. The rebalance is an investment in the region’s future – it will help the Asia-Pacific unlock its tremendous promise and to build a brighter future.  And that’s good for the United States.  For example, the United States wants to reinforce the open and inclusive economic approach that we all know can continue to benefit the region.  That’s why one of the most important non-military initiatives of the rebalance is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, which will bind the United States more closely together with 11 other economies, guarantee a high-quality, high-standard trade system, and support more U.S. exports and higher-paying American jobs.  For those reasons, and its strategic value, TPP is an opportunity the region and the United States cannot afford to miss. Unfortunately, challenges always accompany opportunities in times of change.  Today in the Asia-Pacific, there are a number of security challenges, including North Korea, which, with its nuclear saber-rattling, continues to threaten our allies and heighten tensions in the region.  There are also challenges to the shared principles we’ve long helped uphold.  For example, maritime concerns in the East and South China Seas, the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere pose a risk to the region’s prosperous future.  Terrorism and other transnational threats spare no region of the globe. As we support these principles, the United States will continue to stand with our allies and partners, and we will – as we have demonstrated and as we will continue to demonstrate – fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. With the military component of the rebalance, the United States will help the region to meet these challenges and to remain the primary mainstay of security in the Asia-Pacific.  The men and women of the Defense Department, including all of you, have pursued each phase of the rebalance with strength, commitment, and inclusion. In the first phase beginning five years ago, DoD quantitatively and geographically enhanced the U.S. military’s force posture in this vast region.  After years of emphasis on counterterrorism and wars in the Middle East, which we needed to pay attention to, and in light of the regional changes since the end of the Cold War, we made a choice to strengthen our posture in the Asia-Pacific to make it more robust, as well as more geographically distributed, more operationally resilient, and politically sustainable in the region. That’s why DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region.  That’s why we committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets in the Asia-Pacific by 2020.  That’s why we began to modernize our footprint in Japan and the Republic of Korea.  And that’s why we began to realign our Marines from a highly-centralized presence in Okinawa, Japan, to additional locations in Australia, Hawaii, and Guam – the latter serving as a strategic hub. In the second phase of DoD’s rebalance, which we launched last year, we’ve made qualitative improvements to our force posture – upgrading our own military capabilities – while at the same time also modernizing and advancing our defense relationships to reflect regional change and new opportunities. The second phase’s force posture improvements included sending our best people – sailors like you – and assigning our most advanced capabilities to the Asia-Pacific, including F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, continuous deployments of strategic bombers, and our newest surface warfare vessels, including all of our newest stealth destroyers, the DDG-1000.  We also continued making strategic and substantial investments in new capabilities critical to the rebalance, like not only growing the overall number of surface ships but also making each of them much more lethal, and investing more in Virginia-class submarines and in areas like cyber.  And we developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts, which we put to use in more complex and expansive training exercises – both on our own and with our allies and partners – none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC. Also in the second phase, we sought to modernize America’s relationships with militaries across the region.  These are ties that have been nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice.  But they also need to evolve to reflect growing capabilities, new national aspirations, and changing security needs. You can see the breadth and depth of this modernization…starting with our allies. The U.S.-Japan alliance, to begin with, remains the cornerstone of Asia-Pacific security.  And with our new Defense Guidelines, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger, or more capable of contributing to security in the region and beyond. Our alliance with the Republic of Korea also continues to evolve, to assure deterrence on the Korean peninsula…including through the joint decision earlier this year to deploy the THAAD ballistic missile defense system to the Republic of Korea to help defend against North Korean threats there. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Australia alliance is, more and more, a global one.  As our two nations partner together across the Asia-Pacific, we’re also together accelerating the defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria. Our long-standing alliance with Thailand goes back to the 19th century and continues to benefit both countries and contribute to regional security. And as it has been for decades, our alliance with the Philippines is ironclad.  And through the landmark Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, the United States is supporting the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces. Next, America’s regional partnerships are growing in number and strength. The U.S.-India military relationship is the closest it’s ever been.  Great nation, large, democracy.  Through our strategic handshake – with America reaching west in the rebalance, and India reaching east in what Prime Minister Modi calls  his Act East policy – our two nations are exercising together by air, land, and sea – never did that before.  And there’s also a technological handshake – the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, or DTTI, grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India campaign – helping our countries move toward more diverse defense co-development and co-production of weapons systems. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Singapore relationship continues to grow, with Singapore’s hosting of American littoral combat ships and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. The U.S.-Vietnam partnership has also been dramatically strengthened.  The United States lifted the ban on lethal weapons sales to Vietnam recently to provide Vietnam greater access to the military equipment it needs and wants.  In fact, today, right as we speak, right here the U.S.S. John McCain – named after the father of Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee – is visiting Vietnam as we speak.  I spoke with Senator McCain just yesterday about the historical significance of this visit. And notably, the American and New Zealand militaries have taken an important step forward, as later this fall a U.S. Navy destroyer will make the first American port call in New Zealand in 30 years. And, in the second phase, we’ve also started to connect – and network – these allies and partners together.  A good example is our Maritime Security Initiative, which we launched last year.  It represents an initial $425-million-dollar, five-year, American commitment to enable a regional maritime security network in Southeast Asia.  More than simply providing hardware, this initiative helps the United States enable the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to connect and work with each other – and us – so they can all see more, share more, and do more to ensure maritime security throughout the vital waters of Southeast Asia. Now, given our inclusive approach, DoD is also taking steps to modernize our military-to-military relationship with China.  In recent years, we’ve strengthened communications between our two militaries and reduced the risk of miscalculations that could lead to crises.  We’ve recently concluded two confidence-building measures, one on maritime rules of behavior and another on crisis communications.  We also regularly participate together in multilateral exercises, such as RIMPAC, that demonstrate the value of working together to address security issues.  And our two militaries also hold regular dialogues and high-level consultations that seek to minimize misunderstanding. Now, the United States still has serious concerns with some of China’s recent actions on the seas, in cyberspace, and elsewhere.  Beijing sometimes appears to want to pick and choose which principles it wants to benefit from and which it prefers to try to undercut.  For example, the universal right to freedom of navigation that allows China’s ships and aircraft to transit safely and peacefully is the same right that Beijing criticizes other countries for exercising in the region.  But principles are not like that.  They apply to everyone, and to every nation, equally. As President Obama has said, the U.S.-China relationship will have elements of cooperation but also competition.  We hope that China chooses to join the rest of the region in strengthening and upholding the shared principles that have helped so many nations around the region, including China, to rise and to prosper. In the third phase of the rebalance, we’ll cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second phases, and build upon it…first, by continuing to qualitatively upgrade and invest in our regional force posture with sustained and strategic investments, which I’ll describe in a moment and second, by catalyzing the Asia-Pacific’s principled and inclusive security network even more. In this next phase, the United States will continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region and the security partner of choice.  We’re already sending our best people and platforms into the region, and in the rebalance’s third phase, we’ll increase and target investments to ensure they – and all of you – stay the best. Here are some of the path-breaking, and high-tech improvements we’re making beginning in this budget this year: We’re going to have a few more surprises as well.  These “leap-ahead” investments will keep us ahead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.  I can’t share all the details on these for obvious reasons, but what our friends and our potential adversaries – and all of you – should know is that these new capabilities will help us keep our decades-old commitment to undergirding security in the Asia-Pacific, strong and unchallengeable  These advancements may change how we operate, they will, but they’ll never change why we do so: for the security for our people, for our friends and allies, and they principles that have benefited so many in the region for so long. As we make these investments in our military edge, we’ll also catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing principled and inclusive security network.  Unlike elsewhere in the world, think about this, peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO has in Europe.  That’s because the Asia-Pacific is so different, with its unique history, geography, and politics, and accordingly bilateral relationships, one country to another, have instead been  the mainstay of military cooperation in the region. And yet, as the Asia-Pacific continues to change, as it faces opportunities and challenges, as it becomes more interconnected politically and economically, the region’s militaries are increasingly coming together in new ways, and thereby creating, gradually, a security network  that’s principled and inclusive. We’re finding more and more every day– we in the United States are finding more every day —that nations in the Asia-Pacific see future opportunities to improve their militaries and their security, and they’re increasingly coming to us to partner.  And we also find more and more that they have concerns about the future – aggression and coercion, terrorism, and transnational threats, even natural disasters – and once again we experience a growing demand for American posture and American partnership.  Meeting this demand and fueling this vision is the other big part of the third phase of the rebalance. The result is the steady growth of a principled and inclusive security network.  It’s grounded in the principles – like freedom of navigation and overflight – that our countries have collectively promoted and upheld for decades.  And it’s inclusive since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute.  Everyone gets a voice, and no one is excluded…and by the way, that includes China, and its military, and we hope China doesn’t exclude itself. The principled and inclusive security network is not a formal alliance, nor is it an effort to contain or isolate any one.  Rather, it’s a way for the United States, all of our allies, partners, and friends, and others in the region to connect, cooperate, and contribute to regional security and to uphold shared principles. This network’s been developing in several ways. First, trilateral mechanisms are bringing together trios of allies and partners that previously worked together only bilaterally.  This might seem like a small thing, but if you know the history out here, it’s not.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea, two great allies of ours with which we’ve worked for many decades with each individually, now willing to work together with us.  That partnership helps us coordinate responses, very importantly, to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations.  And for the very first time, our three nations conducted a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise earlier this summer. Second, beyond their relationships involving the United States, many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own by establishing bilateral and trilateral mechanisms.  For example, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines recently agreed to coordinated trilateral maritime patrols to counter piracy, organized crime, and terrorist activity in the Sulu Sea.  This is a good thing on its own, but it’s also an important step for this developing network and the region. And third, even more broadly, regional nations are developing a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – with, as a central example, the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus.  Tomorrow, as I mentioned, my ASEAN defense counterparts and I will gather in Hawaii to discuss regional challenges.  This is the second such informal dialogue the United States has hosted, and we’re going to reflect on our shared interests and principles and identify new ways to partner together to further realize them. And of course, every security network needs networkers – nations, people, and militaries to enable it.  So even as we respond to these five challenges I talked about earlier all around the world, which only the United States has the strength to do, the U.S. Defense Department is also enabling the Asia-Pacific principled and inclusive security network to help networked militaries to do more with us, together, and on their own. So we’ll play our part, including in some specific ways.  American personnel postured throughout the region – in Australia, on Guam, and elsewhere – will deploy more often to operate with both their American colleagues and their regional counterparts.  That’ll help us solidify military-to-military relationships, strengthen security cooperation, and enhance deterrence.  These deployments and our investments will also improve interoperability so that our militaries can work with and off of the same platforms.  And, the exercises we’ve held for years, and intensified in phase two of the rebalance, will also grow more frequent and complex.  And we’re going to supply the resources to make it so. DoD also appreciates that many of our U.S. government partners have their own rebalance initiatives, and each offers new opportunities to work together in this vital region.  So for example, we’ll increase the U.S. Coast Guard’s engagement with our ASEAN partners.  And along with the State Department, we’ll weave together our security assistance programs in the Asia-Pacific so we can boost the capabilities of our allies and partners and the security network, while making them more interoperable. All of these efforts demonstrate how DoD will continue to pursue – on our own and with our partners at home and in the region – new ways ensure security in the Asia-Pacific.  One possibility is in cyber.  Because the network is so rich with nations with cyber expertise, including Japan, Korea, India, Singapore, as each of our countries develop their cyber capabilities, we can learn from each other and cooperate together in this important domain. In total, the third phase of the rebalance and the principled and inclusive security network will improve how we – and all of you – ensure regional security and uphold principles in the years ahead.  For example, after a future typhoon, we may see an Australian P-8 with Singaporean personnel aboard coordinate with an American destroyer in search and rescue operations.  And freedom of navigation may also be upheld, in part, by joint – and networked – patrols, as networked navies and air forces fly, sail, and operate together everywhere that international law allows…to ensure the region’s waterways remain safe and open. And of course – and this is what I want to conclude with – the key to all of this…to the third phase of the rebalance, is all of you.  You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific – once again, the single most consequential region for America’s future and the world – realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play. You’ll do so with strength.  After all, you’re part of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, no one more capable, no one more innovative…because our military edge is second-to-none.  And it will be, it will be so, as far into the future as I can see.  Because through our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, we’re making investments to ensure you stay the best and the United States remains the region’s strongest military. You’ll do so with commitment and the commitment of the entire Defense Department and entire nation at your backs.  Each part – economic, political, and military – and each phase of the rebalance has been a commitment to realizing the Asia-Pacific’s principled future.  As you carry out the rebalance’s third phase, you’re not only answering your nation’s call and ensuring the United States meets this commitment; you’re also meeting the call of our regional allies and partners. And most important, you’ll do so with principle.  That’s who we are as a country, and it’s who you are as a military.  You’re our best networkers.  You’re why we have so many friends and partner.  It’s not an accident.  Because you are not only immensely skilled and capable, but you embody the principles that have helped so many in the Asia-Pacific already to rise and prosper – inspiring, cooperating, including, representing the principles that others value, other people want, and working with our allies and partners to ensure a better world.  That reputation of yours makes me proud. With your strength, commitment, and inclusion, and your contributions to the rebalance’s third phase, you’re carrying on a pretty rich heritage: one passed from those who served on the Missouri seven decades ago, to those who serve on the Vinson here today.  From those who served in the Asia-Pacific in World War II and the Cold War, to those of the post 9/11 era.  And from those who’ve worked on the rebalance’s first and second phases to those who will execute its third phase and its future phases.  In this, you will help realize the prayer MacArthur spoke 71 years ago this month – you will help preserve peace, stability, and progress.  And in so doing, you will keep our country safe, and ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper. Thank you.  Keep it up.  Your country is behind you.  I’m 100 percent behind you. # # # ",Remarks on “The Future of the Rebalance: Enabling Security in the Vital & Dynamic Asia-Pacific” ,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/959937/remarks-on-the-future-of-the-rebalance-enabling-security-in-the-vital-dynamic-a/
"April 2, 2015","This April, the Department of Defense observes Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. While we must spread awareness and prevent these crimes each and every day, this is an important opportunity to remind ourselves why ridding our ranks of sexual assault and sexual harassment is so critical. The values of honor and trust are the lifeblood of our military, and every act of sexual assault directly undermines those values. So too does every act of retaliation against those who report these crimes. This year’s theme, “Eliminate Sexual Assault: Know Your Part. Do Your Part.” reminds us that we all have a responsibility to prevent these crimes and support the survivors – not only to live our core values and protect one another, but also to ensure our people can focus on the mission. This is an issue our force, both of today and tomorrow, cares deeply about. When I spoke at my high school earlier this week, a young student asked me about the issue of sexual assault and wanted to know what we were doing to ensure our military is “a safe and welcome place.” That is why it is the responsibility of every servicemember to help make our military the last place a sexual offender wants to be. Together, we must assure an environment where sexual assault is neither condoned nor ignored; we must reinforce a culture of prevention, accountability, dignity, and respect throughout our ranks; and we must advocate for and staunchly support all who courageously report this crime. Our nation looks to us to lead boldly on this front – and to care for our fellow men and women who bravely serve. Every single one of us must know our part, do our part, and keep doing whatever it takes to eliminate sexual assault in the military.

"March 30, 2016","Good afternoon, everyone.  Just...before we get started, just take a moment to look at those men and women in front of us.  So magnificent and so proud.  And what they stand for, which is many, many, many more behind them.  You all look absolutely fabulous, we're so proud of you. Many distinguished guests, elected officials, members of the CENTCOM team, friends, family, it's an honor to be with you as we honor two great Americans and their families.  Today, we pass the torch between two of our military's most distinguished officers, between two leaders whose selfless dedication and service are emblematic of this command and its people, between General Lloyd Austin and General Joe Votel. But before I speak to the qualities and accomplishments of two extraordinary leaders, I want to speak directly to you, all the men and women of CENTCOM, for what you do today and every day to protect America's interests in a troubled region, to keep our country and people safe.  For that, thank you. As you coordinate the operations of your brothers and sisters who serve eight, nine or 10 times zones away, many of you I know keep the same hours.  For some of you, it can be dark when you get to work and dark when you get home.  I know that serving here at CENTCOM demands a lot from you and your families, and I want you and them to know how grateful I am, how grateful this country is, for what you do on many fronts, and particularly in the campaign to defeat ISIL. I outlined our counter-ISIL campaign when I spoke earlier this year at CENTCOM.  Alongside Chairman Dunford, General Austin and General Votel, I described then the three central objectives of that campaign:  first, to destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and collapse its two power centers in Raqqa and Mosul; second, to combat the metastases of ISIL worldwide; and third, to protect our homeland. One of the leaders we celebrate today put a finer point on our mission.  General Austin said, at that time, quote, “We've got to keep our dukes up.”  In your work across the U.S. government and with partners across the world, you've helped us do just that by creating and exploiting in ever-expanding opportunities to attack ISIL. With additional training and assistance for local forces to take and hold territory and with support from coalition partners, we're continuing to gather momentum and we will deliver ISIL a lasting defeat. In recent months, Iraqis trained and supported by the U.S.-led coalition have consolidated their gains around Ramadi.  They're reclaiming further territory in Anbar Province.  In Syria, capable local forces supported by the U.S. and our global coalition have retaken the eastern Syrian town of Shadadi, helping to severe the last major northern artery between Raqqah and Mosul. Meanwhile, 90 percent of our military coalition partners have committed to increasing contributions to also help defeat ISIL.  We've increased out strikes on ISIL's oil enterprise and cash depots.  We've removed top ISIL leaders from the battlefield and conducted targeted strikes in Libya as well. Of course, your work at CENTCOM extends well beyond one threat or even one critical campaign.  From your continued support of our ongoing mission to support the Afghan people in their pursuit of a secure and prosperous future, to your constant effort to deny Al Qaida and other violent extremists to safe haven, to your support for efforts to counter Iran's malign influence in the region, CENTCOM continues to address some of our nation's most vital national security interests. Now, over the past three years, the people of CENTCOM have met these challenges under the extraordinary leadership of a towering figure in the life of our military, General Lloyd Austin.  Now, it's one of the highest compliments in the Army to be called a soldier's soldier, and for more than four decades, Lloyd Austin has not only demonstrated what it means to be a soldier's soldier, he's come to define it. Through gallantry on the battlefield which earned him a Silver Star, through the courage he has inspired among his troops and through his quiet, confident determination to see every mission, Lloyd will be remembered among this generation's most accomplished soldiers, statesmen and strategists.  And to think, when Lloyd arrived at West Point in the 1970's, he had a simple plan; he would finish his service obligation and then attend law school.  Think about that.  Lloyd is your lawyer.  I think it would depend on what the crime was, how that worked out. But truth be told, Lloyd, you might be starting a little late.  There's still time.  But of course, in the years that followed West Point, Lloyd showed a remarkable knack for leadership in the Army. As Lloyd rose through the ranks, he excelled as leader within some of the Army's most celebrated institutions, whether during his time with the 10th Mountain, the 82nd Airborne or the 18th Airborne Corps, Lloyd left and imprint and a legacy and all he served. But not even a leader of Lloyd's foresight could have anticipated how much the country would ask of him and his family over these past 15 years.  Over a period of time when we've asked so much from our troops and their families, few military leaders have given more, seen more and accomplished more than Lloyd Austin. His actions in 2003, leading the 3rd Infantry Division into Baghdad, helped to capture the indomitable spirit and inspiring leadership that has defined his entire career.  One of Lloyd's soldiers, then-Sergeant Demetrius Johnson, once described the situation to a journalist, and I quote, 
“there were units running low on ammo, visibility was low, and the enemy was closing in.  You could hear a lot of uncertainty in the voices of commanders on the radio.  But amid the sound and fury of that day, amid one of the largest infantry maneuvers in recent history, there was a powerful voice of calm at the center, that of then-Brigadier General Lloyd Austin.” Rather than leading operations from afar, he led from the front.  Lloyd insisted that his command be nimble enough and close enough to the center of the fight.  Rather than raising his voice or shouting commands from behind the line, Lloyd took command of a complex, fluid and dangerous environment with complete composure. As Master Sergeant Johnson explained, and I quote, “when you heard him…you got a sense of calm and peace…You trusted him.  Everyone he comes in contact with trusts him,” end quote. And it's because of his quiet confidence and above all, the confidence it inspires — and because of his complete candor that General Austin has earned the trust of so many, not within — only within our military or our government, but they're including with their deep appreciation this Secretary of Defense and the President, but also across the world. His patient insights, his powerful intellect and his undeniable presence have developed deep bonds of trust, and it is upon this foundation that Lloyd has helped to build a formidable military coalition now taking the fight to ISIL. While few military leaders have overseen operations of greater complexity than General Austin, he's described a measure for success that is both simple and profound.  General Austin's ultimate objective, and I quote him, “is to be loved by his family, respected by his peers, feared by his enemies.” Lloyd, on all three accounts, you've accomplished your mission. Your four decades of selfless service are a tribute to your personal integrity, to the force you have served so nobly, and to the country you love so deeply.  Lloyd, on behalf of the Department of Defense and a grateful nation, we thank you. And I also want to thank your partner and inspiration, your lovely wife Charlene, for the tremendous support for the tremendous support that she has provided not only to you but the people and families of CENTCOM and so many who have served under your command. Charlene, you've sacrificed greatly over these many years and we owe you and your entire family a tremendous debt of gratitude.  I know that you're looking forward to spending some more time with your husband, and we in the DOD family, to include Stephanie and me, wish your family the very best of luck. Earlier today, I spoke about the distinguished leader who will assume General Austin's command, General Joe Votel.  As different as their two careers have been, both General Austin and General Votel share a common foundation.  These are two men who know what it means to be servant leaders and soldier statesmen. As I said earlier today, I recommended General Votel to President Obama to lead CENTCOM for three central reasons, reasons that are plainly evident when you look at his extraordinary leadership.  First, Joe has extensive experience with all elements of the Joint Force: air, sea, ground, of course, special operations, but also cyber and space.  This Joint experience, and importantly, transregional experience, has provided him the perspective and authority to lead the enormous and varied forces America brings to bear in CENTCOM. With SOCOM itself, his clear and creative problem-solving, from personnel and leadership to acquisition, and of course, operations, is something that I have come to consult myself again and again as I approach broader challenges in DOD. Now, second, General Votel has extensive experience and deep understanding of CENTCOM's area of responsibility, its history, its challenges. And third, over these past 19 months, Joe has forged difficult consensus and cemented strong partnerships with many of his regional counterparts.  His political military scale and strength as a warrior diplomat make him the perfect fit to be the next CENTCOM commander, a command where our partners matter so much and our partnerships run so deep. Joe Votel and Lloyd Austin are two accomplished generals, but at their core, they're two devoted Americans who have demonstrated unwavering dedication to our mission, to the military and to its people and to the security of this great country.  Across their careers, both men have demonstrated what could be described as inherent resolve.  It's fitting, then, that as we mark the change of command between these leaders, that we introduce today the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal. I'm pleased to announce today, by the president's order and upon the chairman's and my recommendation that our sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines serving in Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Inherent Resolve are eligible for this medal and distinction. As we continue to accelerate our counter-ISIL campaign, we will continue to depend on the men and women of CENTCOM.  It is you who provide us the flexibility to respond to any threat across this critical region, it is you who provide our partners the fortitude to reclaim their lands, their lives and their future.  And in General Joe Votel, you have a rare a leader with the capabilities and experience to carry forward the mission General Austin has led so capably. So today, as we mark this change of command at CENTCOM between two proven statesmen, Joint Force warriors, coalition builders, we also celebrate a remarkable continuity.  These two men have led on different battlefields, but they both understand the powerful responsibility of asking our young people to enter extreme danger to accomplish a vital mission.  These are two leaders who appreciate deeply the weight of all we ask our troops and their families to carry. We cannot predict precisely how or when the men and women of CENTCOM will be called to carry forward their mission in the months and years to come, but we do know this.  We know General Votel will lead this team with certainty, clarity and with the total trust and confidence of me and the president.  We know that as our military protects our nation and people and as our country helps provide security for men and women across the world to live full lives, to dream their dreams, to raise their children, CENTCOM's efforts will remain essential. And this we know with absolute certainty.  The force General Votel inherits is ready to execute its vital responsibilities thanks to General Austin's remarkable leadership. To General Austin, to General Votel, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership, thank you.

"Oct. 1, 2014","Four months ago, I ordered a review of DOD's Military Health System.  It focused on access to care, quality of care, and patient safety. This review was led by our Deputy Secretary of Defense, Bob Work, who's to my left.  And I want to thank Bob, and I want to thank his team and all those here today and their teams for their leadership, for their efforts, and for the work that they've put in to this review.  We all feel very strongly that there is nothing more important for our people than the health and well-being of our people and their families. Our Military Health System is a large, global system with more than 50 hospitals and 600 clinics in America and around the world.  It offers services ranging from battlefield medevac to pediatrics and dentistry.  Through direct and purchase care, it serves 9.6 million people, including servicemembers, retirees, and their families. Combat care is and must always be a central focus for the Military Health Care [sic] System.  It's helped save and rehabilitate the lives of thousands and thousands of Americans who have worn our nation's uniform.

	But our Military Health System has responsibilities beyond the battlefield, and our review focused on non-combat care. The review found pockets of excellence -- significant excellence, which we're very proud of -- and extraordinary doctors, nurses, and staff who are deeply dedicated to the patients they serve.  They are reflected by our three Surgeons General, who you will hear from in a few minutes.  It also found gaps, however, and facilities it must improve. The bottom-line finding is that the Military Health Care System provides health care that is comparable in access, quality, and safety to average private-sector health care.

	But we cannot accept average. We cannot accept average when it comes to caring for our men and women in uniform and their families. We can do better. We all agree we can do better.  The surgeons general and their staffs and men and women who care for our people know that more than any of us and are dedicated to doing better. Even small lapses in care can lead to devastating and heartbreaking losses or injuries. We must hold the entire Military Health System to the same exacting standards that we demand of our combat missions.

	So today, I'm directing the Department of Defense to take steps to ensure that the entire Military Health System is not merely an average system, but a leading system, because that's what America's troops and their families deserve.

	These are first steps, but they will help our hospitals and clinics foster a stronger culture of safety, quality, and accountability - a culture that must become second nature to all who execute DOD's critical health care system and our mission. Today I'm directing all health care facilities identified as outliers in the categories of access, quality and safety to provide action plans for improvement to Deputy Secretary Work within 45 days. I'm directing the head of the Defense Health Agency, Dr. Woodson - who is here with us today - and all our Surgeons General, to ensure that we have unified standards for purchased, as well as direct care, and to establish a mechanism for patients and concerned stakeholders to provide ongoing input. I'm also directing the Department's health care leadership to establish a system-wide performance management system that will help scrutinize lapses and monitor progress.  And to enhance transparency, I'm requiring that all currently available data on our health care system be made publicly available. By the end of the year, DOD will have a detailed implementation plan to ensure that the Military Health Care System becomes the top performing system we all expect it to be and want it to be. These steps are the beginning, not the end, of an effort to improve our military health care system.  And I will receive regular progress updates from DOD's health care leaders. We have the finest military in the world.  Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve the finest health care in the world. We all agree on that. I know our military health care providers agree with this and every part of it.  And I thank them for what they do, what they continue to do every day…because they, more than anyone else, are committed to offering the best care for our people. I know that Admiral Kirby was out here a couple minutes ago and laid out the format that we'd like to proceed with and that is to have our three Surgeons General and the head of our health care system, Dr. Woodson, along with Dr. Junor and our Deputy Secretary of Defense, Bob Work, take questions as to how we're going to implement the recommendations that came out of the review, what are the next steps, and some of the other questions that you may have in regard to this review. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.

"June 30, 2016","What a spectacular looking group, and particularly for the kids. Thank you for your patience. I’ll be brief, but it’s important and I hope that you’ll remember some of it. Lieutenant Colonel Farooq, thank you for that kind introduction. I want to thank Secretary Fanning, Eric, thanks for being here also, and welcome all of our international friends who are joining us. To our Turkish allies who are with us today this evening, my thoughts and prayers are with you, and with the families and friends of those affected by the attack in Istanbul this week. It was an attack on us all, and I want to assure you that the people of the United States stand with the extraordinary people of Turkey at this difficult time. I also want to thank Imam Zia Makhdoom , Imam thank you, for honoring us with your presence, thank you. Finally I want to thank Chaplain Kenneth Williams and his staff for helping to make this wonderful event a reality, as they have for so many other gatherings of faith at the Pentagon through the year, from Good Friday, to Purim, to Diwali, to Vaisakhi and every week at the Pentagon prayer breakfast, thank you. The Department of Defense is one family of many faiths, and this is a family gathering. So thank you for welcoming me and my wife Stephanie, and Ramadan Kareem to all of the Muslim servicemembers and civilians within our department. This Ramadan includes the longest days of the year, so I’m going to be brief so you can break your fast soon. But I want to note that this Ramadan also includes the 4th of July, the day our nation was born of the self-evident truths that we’re all created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All of us. Right now, right now as we’re here this evening, there are thousands of Muslim-American Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen serving and defending those ideals in every time zone, in the air, ashore, and afloat. They stand in a long line of patriots who have stepped forward throughout our history to pursue the noblest of callings, which is to protect our people, uphold humankind’s highest values, and make a better world for our children. They, and their remarkable military families, serve in the footsteps of the extraordinary Muslim-American veterans with us today, like Sheikh Nazeem Abdul Karriem, who fought on the beaches of Normandy. Sir, thank you again for being here. And Imam Ghayth Kashif, who fought in the Korean War and continues to find ways to serve today. Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you for your service, and thank you for being with us today. Those who serve today also follow the legacy of our fallen heroes, brave Muslim-Americans like Specialist Kareem Rashad Khan, who died serving our nation in Baqouba, Iraq. To his mother Elsheba, I thank you for honoring us with your presence. We know we lack the words to do justice to what you feel as we remember your remarkable son. We can never fully know. But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to this nation, and to a world that still depends so much on American men and women in uniform for its security. And we are profoundly grateful. It has been said that security is like oxygen: if you have it, you don’t think about it. But if you don’t have it that’s all you can think of. The Muslim-Americans who now serve our nation in uniform, as well as the many more who support their mission in a civilian capacity, play a critical role in providing that oxygen to the world, alongside their fellow servicemembers and colleagues of every faith and every background. When I became Secretary of Defense, I made a commitment to building America’s force of the future – the all-volunteer military that will defend our nation for generations to come and that will be in the future as it is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And like our outstanding force of today, our force of the future must continue to benefit from the best people America has to offer. In the 21st century, that requires drawing strength from the broadest pool of possible talent. That’s why we’ve opened all combat positions to women who can meet our standards. And it’s why we must continue to find ways of recruiting, training and retaining the finest Americans from every community and every background in this country. To succeed in our mission of national defense, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from any part of the country that has talent and skills. And drawing from all of our strengths increases the experience and perspective of the force. For some of your fellow servicemembers or colleagues, you may have been the first Muslim they’ve gotten to know well. And so you’ve already given them a perspective they never had before, just as they’ve probably expanded your perspective as well. That expanded perspective is critical to our mission of national defense, because it allows our men and women to thrive in uncertain situations, to understand and respect differences, and to work with others to solve seemingly intractable problems,  to create new partnerships, and to build new coalitions.  It spurs innovation, and builds bridges. When I visit with foreign leaders I often hear how much they like to work with our men and women in uniform, not only because they’re very capable, but because they conduct themselves decently, they’re trustworthy, and they live our values —including respecting differences, and finding strength in them.  Those are values that many nations around the world find to be honorable, decent, and attractive to themselves. Many of you know what that means firsthand, whether you’ve helped harden our networks in the cyber domain as some of you have, or conducted exercises with our allies in the waters of the Asia Pacific, or responded to a disaster in some far off corner of the globe, your individual actions are a clear reflection of our values and our leadership.  “Strength in Faith, and Character in Service” are not just themes for tonight’s celebration, they are part of the foundation that enables everything we do around the world. This is particularly important as we work to counter the insidious influence of organizations that seek to subvert the meaning of Islam to inspire violence and destruction. The men and women here tonight, and those observing Ramadan on every ship and every base around the world, are the most powerful argument against the twisted ideology of ISIL, Al Qaeda and any other terrorist organizations of any origin that seek to hijack faith in order to promote their brand of evil. We all stand firm in the service of our nation to defend the very freedoms that bind us together as Americans – not only the freedom of religion – but liberty and justice for all.  And it is through our resolve and enduring commitment to global peace and security that we will, we will, we’re sure to overcome any threats to our way of life, and the corrupt ideologies that may underpin them. Our annual Pentagon Iftar recognizes the true spirit of Ramadan, a time when Muslims recommit themselves to their faith, following days of sacrifice, discipline and patience with nights of gratitude.  It is a time of renewal, a reminder of one’s duty to serve one another, and to lift up the less fortunate.  So, I am honored to spend my evening with you to honor the values we share: peace, charity, and forgiveness.  And I am profoundly grateful to you and your families for your service and sacrifice here at home and around the world – that’s each and every one of you, including each and every one of the kids here. So as we break the fast, let us give thanks for the opportunity to defend and live in a country founded on the principles of freedom of religion, tolerance, and mutual respect. Let us give thanks to those who have fought and died for those freedoms. And let us give thanks to God for the blessings that we share. May God bless all of you, may God bless all of our troops, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.

"July 11, 2015","President Hokama, thank you much for that wonderful introduction, for your leadership of the National Association of Counties, and thank you for inviting me here today and all of you for coming. Because what you do in your counties and your communities is so important. And not just to our country, but – and that’s the point I want to make – our military. It’s so very important because our men and women in uniform don’t come from the Pentagon. They come from your communities. We recruit from your communities. Our servicemembers and their families live in your communities while they’re serving – including our Guardsmen and Reservists – and when they leave military service, they’ll once again be in your communities. And for job, family, or other reasons, your community may be a place they’re coming to for the first time. We’ve needed to make changes in how we defend you as the world’s threat’s change, as the world’s opportunities have changed, as technology changes, and as new generations come of age in our great country of America. One of the many things, many things I’m proud of about the Department of Defense is that we’re a learning organization – so that we look out on a changing world, we change our strategies, we change ourselves. But one thing we haven’t had to change is how our servicemembers returned home to a grateful nation and grateful communities. Throughout it all, you are there for them – and believe me, I know a time when it was different. And on behalf of the Department of Defense, I want to thank you all for that. But it’s true that while at the end of World War II no fewer than 10 percent of our entire population was on active duty, that’s not the case anymore. Today, we have a smaller yet highly-specialized force of all volunteers who comprise about 1 percent of our population. While they receive widespread public support from those they defend, it’s also true that because fewer Americans are serving in uniform, fewer have personal connections to those who do. For my generation and my parents’ generation, three-out-of-four had a family member who served, but for our kids’ generation, it’s only one-in-three. And because these connections significantly influence whether a person decides to serve in the first place, this trend is likely to continue. Meanwhile, with our men and women in uniform doing such a superb job of keeping us secure, sometimes – I have to say – I feel like what they do is not being adequately appreciated, or is being taken for granted. And that can be frustrating to me sometimes. You see, security’s like oxygen, and if you have it, you don’t pay any attention to it; if you don’t have it, it’s all you can think about. And so when I get frustrated, I tell myself, you know, our military’s mission is to make sure that everyone else in our country – that 99 percent – can go to bed at night safely, sleep peacefully, wake up, hug their children, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, and not have to worry about their security. And so, when our troops succeed, it can be easier for some of them not to see how much they owed them. That’s a paradox that’s not easily reconciled, but one that I see and understand. The soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who defend our country in uniform are, as I always tell them, the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And that’s true first and foremost because of the people themselves, and secondly, the technology and the strategies they use, but next – and this is where you come in – because of the foundation provided by the communities and counties like yours. While each of those three is critical to sustaining our Armed Forces, none of them can be taken for granted. And I don’t. Indeed, all three must be continually renewed for the future. I’ll mention the first two briefly, but then I want to bear down on the piece you here reflect – our military’s foundation in America’s communities. I’ll start with our people. They’re all volunteers, so for us to keep recruiting and retaining the best America has to offer, the military has to be an attractive place to work, especially for those with in-demand talent and high-level skills. That means we have to keep up with trends, like the recent revolution in technology – excuse me, in talent management – and the fact that some young Americans today aren’t satisfied with industrial-age career tracks. They want to be on a jungle gym, where you get up by moving around and having new experiences, not an escalator, where you get on and wait your turn. To attract and compete for talent in these new generations, we’re trying to build what I call the force of the future. We’re pushing to be attractive to this generation, to be more geographically diverse, making on-ramps and off-ramps to give our people more choices, and bringing our personnel management systems into the 21st century. We’re also drilling tunnels through the walls that too often separate government and the private sector, particularly in scientific and commercial technology areas, because we need America’s brightest minds to contribute to our mission. And as for technology, in the past – when I began my own career – there were such close ties between industry and the defense sector that we created breakthroughs like GPS, and the Internet itself, and before that satellite communications, the jet engine, and other innovations, which advanced both our security and our society. Today, we have to renew that partnership to sustain our military’s second primary ingredient – its superior technology. And our technological edge has never been guaranteed. It’s not a birthright, and to sustain it, we have to keep up with several trends. The technology base has become global and more commercialized than it was when I started out. High-end technologies long possessed by only the most advanced militaries have gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors. And nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap. To stay ahead of these challenges, and to stay the best, DoD is investing in innovation. We’re pushing the envelope in new technologies – like cyber, autonomous systems, and hypersonic engines that can fly over five times the speed of sound. And we’re developing new partnerships with America’s private sector and tech communities – starting with setting up a DoD innovation hub in Silicon Valley, and making ourselves more open to working with start-ups, commercial companies, and small businesses. And much of what your local communities do will be critical to these efforts. For example, with schools in many of your communities focusing more on the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, our future recruits – and all young Americans – can be prepared not only to defend us in the future, but to drive that future forward. Our people and technology are vitally important, and I’ll continue to spend a lot of my time and attention on them. But I want to focus today on the third reason why we’re the world’s finest fighting force: the foundation of community and support we receive from counties and families nationwide, from all of you and the people you represent. You and your communities are a source of our military’s enduring strength, because you provide our men and women in uniform with the preparation, the care, and the purpose they need to defend our country. It may not always be obvious to everyone, but our military servicemembers, veterans, families, and survivors are part of almost every community in America. And frequently, their local issues are your local issues. They visit the same parks and museums as you do. Their kids go to school with your kids. They’re our neighbors, our community leaders, and most of all, our friends. And some of them are also colleagues, because hundreds of thousands of Americans serve in the National Guard and Reserves. As some communities know firsthand, when disaster strikes – storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, and the like – they pitch in, laying sandbags, clearing debris, keeping security, conducting search-and-rescue. And more importantly, when we call on them for other operations – like we did for the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – they serve as a vital complement to our active-duty forces. By stepping forward in times of need, Guardsmen and Reservists from your communities uphold one of our oldest traditions – and today, they do so during a time of change in the relationship between Americans and their military. Indeed, one of our nation’s founding precepts was the citizen-soldier, based on the idea that in wartime, every American would be expected to do their part. And for much of our history, that’s what happened. Militias were raised from local communities, and neighbors and friends went to war together, while back home, their parents, siblings, and communities rationed food and clothing, tended victory gardens, gathered scrap metals, or retooled entire industries. But as I said earlier, that’s no longer the case anymore. We have fewer Americans serving, and fewer who are personally connected to those who serve on our behalf. All this means that the community foundation we have today must similarly evolve for the future. This isn’t the World War II-era, and because of what DoD is doing to build the force of the future, transitioning out of the military will look different from how it did 70 years ago – or, for that matter, 10 years ago. It will mean that in the future, while some might serve only for a time, others might spend 25 years moving back and forth between national service and other opportunities, like using the G.I. Bill to get a degree or applying their skills in the private sector. Also, we may see some troops and families spending more time in the communities they love, without having to move around as often as they do now. We know we can’t push a one-size-fits-all career model anymore, and we can’t keep pushing a one-size-fits-all, one-stop-shop community foundation anymore, either. As we’ve seen in recent years, each community’s different, and the foundations of preparation, care, and purpose they provide to servicemembers and their families should be different too. People from urban areas and rural areas may have different ideas of what their community should look like, just as a model that works for Riley County, Kansas may be different than one that’s right for Florida’s Miami-Dade. Still, in a future where each community’s foundation will be different, and uniquely tailored to reflect their local civic traditions, resources, and populations, there should be some elements that they have in common. For example, let’s make a future where more Americans nationwide strive not only to support our troops, but to also know our troops – and not just when they come home, but from the moment they start to contribute to our mission. Let’s make a future where this relationship is a two-way street, where both military and civilian communities contribute to each other, share ideas and best practices that can benefit all of us. And let’s behold what will happen when young Americans take notice of how those who serve our country go on to do great things, how military service can be a path to leadership positions in all sectors of society – business, government – a path many of you in this room have taken. And when they see the positive difference it can make in someone’s lives, and the positive difference it’ll make them make in the lives of others, they’ll realize how noble this mission is. When they see the changes we’re making to attract new generations of talent, they’ll realize that they too can make a contribution. And if and when they choose to join us, even if only for a time, we’ll all be safer for it, and our country will be more secure. NACo’s new partnership with Vets’ Community Connections is a great example of how we can get closer to that community foundation. By taking the initiative to provide local servicemembers, veterans, and families with personal, human connections to their own communities – by engaging with the many existing community resources and tools, making them together work together in a smarter way – Veterans’ Community Connections is making a real difference in the lives of our people, and we’re grateful. Let me tell you what else you can do, because your communities are the front lines of the effort. As you see more of our military servicemembers, veterans, families, and survivors, I ask that you embrace them as they join your communities, and empower them with opportunities to continue leading lives of meaning and purpose. It won’t be very hard, because they already tend to be more civically engaged. According to one recent study, veterans are 20 percent more likely to give to charity, they volunteer 30 percent more hours a year, and they’re three times more likely to join a service or civic organization. To be clear, they aren’t looking for handouts. The 9/11 Generation volunteered to serve at a time of war, and they have a strong desire to continue making a difference in the world. All that it takes is finding the right opportunity. Maybe your school board needs a fresh perspective. Maybe your county fair needs new people to help organize it each year. Maybe your son or daughter’s scout troop or sports team needs a mentor they can look up to. In all these situations and so many more, I encourage you to seek out and ask your citizens to seek out someone who’s served – whether they’re on active-duty, Guard or Reserve, a veteran, or a military family member. Harness the invaluable experience, global perspective, and extraordinary talent they bring to the table – talent you’ve invested in and helped develop. Because when you grab hold of our people, you’ll never forget it, and you’ll never regret it. I’ll end by saying that more than 2.6 million American servicemembers deployed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And if any of us were to ask, I bet most of them would say – and I know this because I’ve talked to so many of them – that they’re not heroes, but they are proud to have protected the country and made a better world. They certainly won’t say they’re victims, and won’t be treated that way. Instead, they’re our fellow citizens, and they chose to be part of something bigger than themselves. The sacrifices they’ve made on our behalf are no small thing, but many of them also found great meaning and fulfillment in their service. When you go back home, ask your citizens to take some time to get to know them. Encourage your communities to do the same. You’ll all be glad you did. And thank you, and God bless you, God bless our troops, and God bless the United States.

"March 11, 2015","Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Menendez, all the Members of the Committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be with you today on this important subject. Before I begin, I'm sure you're all aware that a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter was involved in an accident last night near Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. We know there were four air crew – Army from a National Guard unit in Hammond, Louisiana – and seven Marines – assigned to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina – on board that helicopter.  And I know that with me, our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as the search and rescue continues, just as I know we're all proud to have the finest fighting force the world has ever known. That is why, at the end of my first week as Secretary of Defense, I traveled to Afghanistan and Kuwait, where I thanked our men and women in uniform for their contributions to important missions. And in Kuwait, I talked with our ambassadors and our military leaders in the region about the campaign against ISIL. The trip confirmed for me that ISIL represents a serious and complex threat, especially in our interconnected and networked world. But it also confirmed to me that the enemy can be defeated, and we will deliver ISIL the lasting defeat. And I'm happy to share my thoughts about that campaign with you. But let me turn to the subject of this hearing, which is the authorization for the use of military force. And in reviewing the President's proposed AUMF as Secretary of Defense, I asked myself two questions. First, does it provide the necessary authority and flexibility to wage our campaign, allowing for a full range of likely military scenarios? And, second, will it send the message to the people I'm responsible for – our brave men and women in uniform, and civilian personnel – who will wage this campaign, that the country is behind them? I believe the President's AUMF does both, and I urge Congress to pass it. And let me explain why I judged that the proposed AUMF gives the authority and flexibility needed to prevail in this campaign. First, the proposed AUMF takes into account the reality, as Secretary Kerry has noted already, that ISIL as an organization is likely to evolve strategically, morphing, rebranding, and associating with other terrorist groups, while continuing to threaten the United States and our allies. Second, the proposed AUMF wisely does not include any geographical restriction, because ISIL already shows signs of metastasizing outside of Syria and Iraq. Third, the President's proposed authorization provides great flexibility in the military means we need as we pursue our strategy, with one exception: the proposed AUMF does not authorize long-term, large-scale offensive ground combat operations like those we conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan because our strategy does not call for them. Instead, local forces must provide the enduring presence needed for an enduring victory against ISIL. And fourth and finally, the proposed AUMF expires in three years. I cannot tell you that our campaign to defeat ISIL would be completed in three years. But I understand the reason for the proposed sunset provision. It derives from the important principle stemming from the Constitution that makes the grave matter of enacting an authorization for the use of military force a shared responsibility of the President and Congress. The President's proposed authorization affords the American people the chance to assess our progress in three years’ time and provides the next President and the next Congress the opportunity to reauthorize it if they find it necessary. To me, this is a sensible and principled provision of the AUMF, even though I cannot assure that the counter-ISIL campaign will be completed in three years. Now, in addition to providing the authority and flexibility to wage a successful campaign, I said I had another key consideration as Secretary of Defense, and that is sending the right signals, most importantly, to the troops. Passing the proposed AUMF will demonstrate to our personnel that their government stands behind them. And as Secretary Kerry explained, it will also signal to our coalition partners and our adversary that the United States government has come together to address a serious challenge. We all took an oath to protect the nation and its interests. But to do so, we must work together. I know everyone on this committee takes the ISIL threat seriously. President Obama – and everyone at this table – does as well. We encourage a serious debate. But I urge you to pass the President's AUMF because it provides the necessary authority and flexibility to wage our current campaign, and because it will demonstrate to our men and women in uniform – some of whom are in harm's way right now – that all of us stand unflinchingly behind them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

"Nov. 1, 2016","Good evening, everyone, and thank you so much for being here this evening.  And thanks for that kind introduction, Bob, and thanks for inviting me to be here at the start of what looks like a very exciting evening. We have some very good friends here tonight from the department, few finer than our former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, my sidekick – I don’t know where he is – General Marty Dempsey.  Marty, his wife, Deanie – a great friend to myself, and also my wife, Stephanie, who’s here – all lovers of the great force that is ours.  It’s great to see both of you, great to see all of you.  I don’t know whether Pete Chiarelli here – Pete, if you’re here – General Pete Chiarelli, and many, many others, thank you.  Thanks for being here.  Thanks for your support to our people. Our host, Bob Woodruff – thanks for saying that.  Bob, it means a lot to us.  He’s an excellent reporter of course, and he’s right, the last time he interviewed me, we were a long way from midtown Manhattan – almost as far as you can get, in fact – on the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt in the South China Sea.  And that kind of trip is the proof that Bob Woodward will go the extra mile, or thousands of miles, in fact, to write a good story and explain about what we do, and the importance of what we do, to our world.  That’s not a surprise to any of – any of us – I think, who are here in this room.  He goes where the story is, and he’s committed to getting to get it right. Same thing from Martha Raddatz, by the way, whom I see here tonight.  I just left her in Erbil, about 10 days ago or something.  Martha, thank you also. For Bob – in addition to his journalism – Bob and his wife Lee have gone the extra mile for our servicemembers, for our veterans, and their families.  For the last decade, Bob, Lee, and the Woodruff family have stood up – building awareness, raising resources, and making connections for those who stand up for all of us, sometimes in harm’s way.  And for all that, I want to thank you, Bob, Lee, and everyone at the foundation, all of the supporters here, everyone here tonight.  Bless you for that.  We appreciate your standing up for our people.  And I’m going to talk a little bit tonight about how – what we’re doing to stand up for them, too. As I’m sure Bob and Lee can attest, each and every one of them, each soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and veteran, is dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable.  And together, they have made America’s the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  We should all take pride in them, be thankful for them.  Quite simply, they do one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our magnificent country, and make a better world for our children. To do so today, our current force is confronting on our behalf – as we’re here tonight – no fewer than five unique, evolving challenges.  They’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region of the world for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And they’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL – destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and destroying it in Afghanistan, Libya, and everywhere else the ISIL cancer metastasizes around the world, even as they continue to help protect our homeland and our people as well. Moreover, when you look at history, you see we have an almost perfect record of failure, when it comes to predicting the strategic future.  And because of that, we’re being flexible, and they’re being flexible, agile, to contend with a complex and uncertain future, where new challenges will almost certainly arise we don’t foresee today. And now in the Defense Department, we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges – we have to do it all.  And we confront these challenges with the strength of our technology, the strength of our values, with our penchant for innovation.  But the key –  the key – is our people.  To meet those challenges and face that unknown future, DoD counts on and takes care of our force of today, and at the same time, builds what I call the Force of the Future. Let me tell you a little bit about what we’re doing, let me start with today. As Secretary of Defense, my first commitment – and this is something Stephanie and I think about every morning when we begin our day – my first commitment is to our men and women, uniformed and civilian, to their excellence and to their welfare, to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care and strategic necessity. I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and the readiness of today’s fighting force – investing in the right training, the right force size, the right compensation and benefits that our troops and their families and DoD civilians deserve, and the right equipment.  Just to mention that last one, for example, we need to spare no effort and expense and brook no delay when it comes to deploying – for our troops that are in harm’s way – the tools to accomplish their mission and protect themselves, whether with mine-resistant, ambush-protected, or MRAP, vehicles that help keep them safe from roadside bombs, or with new lightweight and easy to use combat application tourniquet, that stems bleeding on the battlefield, has saved countless lives, and is a big advance over its predecessor.  All this, and some ideas that our scientists are working on right now. But of course, our support to today’s force goes well beyond that.  It includes a commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured, and support our military families because they serve, too.  It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice.  It also includes our pledge to help our servicemembers transition when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life.  And I’m very gratified to see the way employers’ attitudes towards veterans have improved in the course of my lifetime.  And it also means that when our servicemembers are not being treated fairly and with respect, we act quickly to fix it, as we’re doing with the California National Guard bonus issue. Our commitment to today’s – our commitment to today’s force also includes ensuring the respect and dignity of our people, one for the other, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault. So with all this, even as our force of today is outstanding and meeting the challenges we face, the Pentagon must also – as I like to say – think outside our five-sided-box about the future, about how we stay the best tomorrow. More than anything else, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known because of our people, and we can’t take that for granted.  As generations change, as technologies change, as labor markets change, we need to stay competitive and to continue to attract and retain the most talented young people that America has to offer.  That’s why we’re taking steps to build what I call the Force of the Future – one that will be just as excellent as the one I have the privilege to lead today. We’ve announced a number of what I call links to that Force of the Future, and I want to say something about a few of them. The first, which I announced a year ago this month, created on-ramps and off-ramps, so more people outside DoD can come inside and contribute to our mission, even if only for a time or a project – for example, in cyber – and also in the other direction, so more people in our military can spend some time outside at a leading company or university to gain skills and perspective they can bring back in to make us better. Link two, focused on improving retention among our ranks, principally by increasing our support to military families.  It’s often said that our military recruits a servicemember, but retains a family.  So with changes like 12 weeks of paid maternity leave for those serving in uniform, increased paternity leave as well, extended childcare hours on bases, we’re making it easier and more desirable for our best people and their families to stay with us. A third link to the Force of the Future improved our military talent management policy to ensure we’re promoting, retaining, and bringing in the best possible officers.  This is about making some common sense adjustments to our strong and successful traditions.  For example, we can’t have an officer promotion system that inadvertently passes over a Rhodes Scholar – which almost happened recently – just because he spent two years at Oxford, and as a consequence hadn’t yet held some of the Army jobs that the others in his cohort had held.  Now fortunately, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley, himself a scholar-soldier, intervened.  So we’re infusing more flexibility into the system and continuing to ensure that promotion is based as much as possible on all relevant kinds of merit and talent. And link number four focused on the talent management of the more than 700,000 DoD civilians.  And you may not know as much about them, but they do things like fix our planes, build our warships, staff our laboratories, and more.  Here, we made changes that make it easier to hire civilians directly – for example, before their senior year in college is over – without the long waits that make it impossible for us to be their first choice, and also to expand scholarship-for-service programs in science and technology fields. And today, earlier today here in New York at City College, I announced links five and six.  Link five, we’re going to tell our story in more places, more ways, and to a broader range of audiences across the country, even as we improve our recruiting efforts to widen our geographic, demographic, and generational access to young Americans – recognizing that 40 percent of our recruits come from just six states, and recognizing that fewer young people today have parents, or teachers, or coaches, or guidance counselors who served.  So these steps will help us to fish in more ponds, new ponds, wider ponds so we always have the best that America has to offer.  And last, we’re making some improvements in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, or ROTC – which celebrates, by the way, this year, including at CCNY, its 100th anniversary, and which furnishes 40 percent of our officers. In addition to all these links from today to the Force of the Future, we’ve also opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now have a full opportunity to draw on 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force – focusing purely on an individual’s willingness and ability to meet our standards and contribute to our mission. Because we’re doing all of those, because we’re taking care of today’s force and also because we’re building the Force of the Future, and because of our nation’s enduring strengths, I’m confident – confident – that we’ll meet those five challenges and fully realize the bright and opportunity-rich future for our country. But I never forget, we can never forget – you don’t forget, or you wouldn’t be here tonight – what makes it all happen.  And you know the answer, because you chose to stand up for them tonight and every day.  And that’s our people. Each of our servicemembers and DoD civilians makes me incredibly proud.  There are almost 3 million of them serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain – in the air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace – all in service of this great nation. All of them are defending not only the United States and its people; they’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while they provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life. Because they do so, we can gather here this evening and enjoy tonight’s concert.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at schools like City College, where I was earlier today.  We can live our lives and dream our dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought. They make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want them all to know that we don’t take them for granted.  Stephanie and I begin every day thinking of them. I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day and for what they’ve done for us.  Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service, valued.  Their sacrifices never will be forgotten. But thank you for recognizing and standing up for them.  Thank you for all you’re doing for them.  God bless them, and God bless this great country.  Enjoy the evening.

"March 4, 2015","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, and Ranking Member Visclosky, for having me here this morning. And thank all the members of the committee for inviting me to be here with you today. While I’ve had the opportunity to speak with many of you before, this is my first time testifying to this committee as the Secretary of Defense. My care and respect for the men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known is as boundless as their skill and dedication. I know this committee shares the same devotion to them – and shares responsibility for them, and for the defense of our great country. And I hope that my tenure as Secretary of Defense will be marked by partnership with you on their behalf. I’m here to present the President’s budget for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2016. And since I’ve been in the job for exactly two weeks and a day, it’s plain that I did not have a role in shaping this budget. But I have studied it carefully and I’m fully prepared to answer your questions about it – and to work with you to find common ground where you have concerns. Most importantly, I strongly support the President in requesting a defense budget above the artificial caps of the Budget Control Act – that is, above so-called sequester levels – next year and in the years thereafter. I share the President’s desire to find a way forward that upholds the fundamental principles behind the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. And I support the President’s commitment to vetoing any bill that locks in sequestration. Because to do otherwise would be both unsafe and wasteful. Before I turn to the budget to explain what I mean by that, allow me to share some observations from my short time on the job, observations that help reinforce my testimony here. Shortly after I was sworn in, I spoke to the people at the Department of Defense – military, civilian, and contractor – and I told them I had three commitments as Secretary of Defense. The first is to them and their families – to their safety, their welfare, and their effectiveness – and equally, to those who came before them and will come after them. The second commitment is to assist the President as he makes difficult choices about how to defend the country in a turbulent world – as the Chairman has affirmed – and then to carry out those decisions where they involve the use of military force. And the third commitment is to the future, to make sure our military remains the very best in an ever-changing world, amid fast-moving technological and commercial change, and as we seek to attract new generations to the wonderful mission of national security in our department. Because of those commitments, I traveled at the end of my first week on the job to Afghanistan to visit our troops and commanders, and also the leaders of Afghanistan and some of their military leaders. I wanted to assess the conditions on the ground there as we enter a new phase of our long campaign, and as we carry out the transition to an enduring presence that will ensure, as the President says, that our progress in Afghanistan sticks. Next I traveled to Kuwait, where I met with the Amir before convening senior American diplomats and military leaders from throughout the region – ambassadors from several countries; our commanders from Central Command, European Command, Africa Command and Special Operations Command; and the commanders of the campaign in Iraq and Syria against ISIL. I wanted to hear directly from them about the complex political and military situation in the entire region, and about the best approaches to leveraging U.S. leadership of the broad coalition combating this ugly scourge. And this morning, I’d be pleased to discuss these challenges, or any others, in addition to the defense budget. But the point is that in these regions of the world, just as in the Asia-Pacific, in Europe, and elsewhere, it is America’s leadership, and America’s men and women in uniform, who stand between disorder and order – who stand up to malicious and destabilizing actors, while standing with those who believe with us in a more secure, just, and prosperous future for all our children. But this Congress will determine whether our troops can continue to do so. The Administration is proposing to increase the defense budget in line with the projection submitted to Congress last year. By halting the decline in defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act, the President’s budget would give us the resources we need to execute our nation’s defense strategy. But – and I want to be clear about this – under sequestration, which is set to return in 211 days, our nation would be less secure. Mr. Chairman, as you and your colleagues have said, sequestration threatens our military readiness – and that was a point that Ranking Member Visclosky made very accurately and pointedly a few moments ago – threatens our military’s readiness, the size of our warfighting forces, the capabilities of our air and naval fleets, and ultimately the lives of our men and women in uniform. The Joint Chiefs have said the same before the Congress – and they could not have been more clear – in their assessment of how sequestration would damage our national security. The great tragedy is that this corrosive damage to our national security is not the result of objective factors, logic, or reason. It’s not that we have some new breakthrough in military technology or a novel strategic insight that somehow provides the same security for a smaller budget. It’s not that sequester is forced upon us by an economic emergency or a dire recession that makes taking grave security risks absolutely necessary. It’s surely not the case that the world has suddenly become more stable or that America has less to do to keep it safe, allowing us to take a peace dividend of some kind. It’s not even that these cuts solve the nation’s overall fiscal challenges – because the sad math is that they are large and sudden enough to damage defense, but fail to resolve our long-term fiscal issues and the real drivers of the deficit and debt. So sequester was not the result of objective factors. Sequester is purely the fallout of political gridlock. Its purpose was to compel prudent compromise on our long-term fiscal challenges – a compromise that never came. This has been compounded in recent years because the Defense Department has suffered a double whammy – the worst of both worlds – that has coupled mindless sequestration with constraints on our ability to reform. We need your help with both. I know that Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and others on this committee are as dedicated to reform as I am. We at the Pentagon can and must do better with getting value for the defense dollar. Taxpayers have trouble comprehending, let alone supporting the defense budget, when they hear about cost overruns, insufficient accounting and accountability, needless overhead, excess infrastructure, and the like. There are significant savings to be found across DoD and we’re committed to pursuing them. But at the same time, I must note that in the past several years, painful but necessary reforms proposed by DoD – reforms involving elimination of overhead and unneeded infrastructure, retirement of older force structure, and reasonable adjustments in compensation – have been denied by Congress at the same time that sequestration looms. I will work with Congress to resolve concerns and find common ground in these matters, but we must have your support. Sequester cuts don’t help us achieve meaningful reform. In fact, the nature of sequester frequently leads to waste – as, for example, when it forces a reduction in contract production rates, driving up unit costs. If confronted with sequestration-level budgets and continued obstacles to reform, I do not believe that we can simply keep making incremental cuts while maintaining the same general set of objectives that have anchored our defense strategy. We would have to change the shape, and not just the size, of our military – significantly affecting parts of our defense strategy. We cannot meet sequester with further half-measures. As Secretary of Defense, I will not send our troops into a fight with outdated equipment, inadequate readiness, or ineffective doctrine. But everything else is on the table – including parts of our budget that have long been considered inviolate. This may lead to decisions that no Americans – including members of Congress – want us to make. I’m not afraid to ask the difficult questions, but if we’re stuck with sequestration’s budget cuts over the long term, our entire nation will have to live with the answers. So instead of sequestration, I urge you to embrace the alternative: building the force of the future, powerful enough to underwrite our strategy, equipped with boldly new technology, leading in domains like cyber and space, attracting and retaining the best Americans to our mission, being lean and efficient throughout this enterprise, and showing resolve to friends and potential foes alike. I think we can all agree that the world in 2014 was more complicated than anyone could have predicted. Given today’s security environment, the President’s proposed increase in defense spending over last year’s budget is responsible, and it’s prudent. I hope we can come together behind a long-term budget approach that dispels sequester and provides stability, rather than doing this one year at a time. I hope we can again unite behind what our great nation should and must do to protect our people and make a better world. And I hope we can provide our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense – who make up the greatest fighting force the world has ever known – what they need, and what they fully deserve. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to your questions.

"Sept. 12, 2014","Good morning, and thank you. Thank you all for being here to help us honor two remarkable American leaders… two public servants who have devoted their careers, their lives, to protecting America’s security and supporting all of those who serve our country in uniform. With increasing pressure to reduce defense budgets; with a world growing more volatile and complex; and with the gears of government continuing to grind ever more slowly – Chairman Levin and Chairman McKeon have worked tirelessly to help provide the Department of Defense with the resources it needs to do its job.  They have helped make our military stronger and our country more secure through their leadership on defense issues and their commitment to our troops and our nation. One of their proudest, most important accomplishments has been upholding both Armed Services Committees’ longtime spirit of bipartisanship.  They ensured that Congress continued its tradition of passing a National Defense Authorization Act every year.  Given the paralysis and the gridlock that has stricken our nation’s Capitol in recent years, that is not a minimal achievement.  It also represents a commitment to responsible and accountable governance, the kind you’d expect from two leaders whose careers in public service date back to their time on their local city councils.  They know about responsible, accountable leadership; responsible, accountable governance. During my service in the Senate, Carl Levin was either the chairman or the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.  Senator Levin has served on that committee since coming to the Senate 36 years ago.  He is as dedicated a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee as it has ever had.  A recent example of that dedication was his recent trip – like just a few days ago – to Ukraine, Iraq, and Jordan.  And this is a Senator who is retiring! During our years together in the Senate, there was no colleague’s advice that I respected more than Carl Levin’s.  And I often sought his advice on many issues.  I’ve always appreciated his straightforward style, his honesty, his outreach, his informed and clear thinking, and maybe most importantly about Carl Levin, his decency and his civility. Carl Levin is the kind of elected leader America will always need – the kind I hope, we all hope, America will always have – the kind of leader who always does what he believes is the right thing, the right thing for his country.  He puts his country first. So does Buck McKeon.  So does Buck McKeon.  As an Army grandparent, Buck has always fought hard to provide our service members and their families with the resources and support they need and deserve to always accomplish their mission.  And after nearly 20 years on the House Armed Services Committee, he’s been among Congress’s strongest advocates for ensuring that our military has the capabilities to meet the complex and challenging threats it faces today and will face in the future. Like Carl Levin, this retiring Member of Congress just returned from a trip to Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco.  And like Carl Levin, he’s demonstrating his absolute commitment to our country and our military – right to the end of his career. Over the past year and a half that I’ve been Secretary of Defense, I’ve counted on Buck’s advice, his honesty, his insights, and yes, his friendship.  Buck McKeon is a man of equal doses of immense courtesy, devotion, ability, and character.  It’s rare, especially these days in our politics, to find an elected leader as open to a vigorous debate and different opinions but yet respectful of other’s opinions and points of views, and willing to always listen as Buck McKeon.  Like Carl Levin, Buck McKeon has never allowed politics to get personal.  That’s why both of these unique leaders are so highly regarded and admired.  They’re not only admired in our country, but throughout the world. As we all know, there is always tension between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch.  That is how our founders designed the system.  But that tension forces us to work together, to make our country better, our government stronger and more responsive and accountable.  But it really depends to a great extent on the leaders themselves and their commitment to making it work.  Carl and Buck have demonstrated that commitment throughout their careers.  They have made their committees and government work, and they’ve done it the right way – the way the Americans deserve to be represented and the way Americans can be proud of their representatives.  They have always made the system work. Today, given the multitude and diversity of complicated threats and challenges that face our country, the relationship between the Department of Defense and Congress must go beyond checks and balances.  It must be a partnership, a real partnership, where we work together for America’s common good and our common defense. The Department of Defense and all its people will always be grateful for what Chairman Levin and Chairman McKeon have done for them, and our nation.  We also appreciate their wives, and their families.  We appreciate the tremendous sacrifices of your families.  Thank you, to Barbara and Patricia especially, and to your families, the McKeon family, the Levin family – thank you.  We know being the spouse of a Congressman or a Senator is not easy.  So we thank you for the constant love and encouragement and support you’ve always provided to Carl and Buck, provided over so many years of their distinguished, very distinguished public service. Carl, Buck, thank you.  We will miss you.  I will miss you.  I will miss you greatly.  But, you’ve earned and deserve a break.  You’ve served our country so well.  And we all wish you and your families every God’s blessing.  Thank you for your service. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

"Sept. 22, 2016","Thank you very much, Chairman [McCain], Ranking Member Reed, all the members of this committee, thank you for having us here. And Chairman, and Senator Reed, thanks for taking the time to talk with me before this hearing – much appreciated as always – and for hosting General Dunford by my side, where he is all the time. And I’m very pleased and our country is very fortunate to have him.  Similarly, I want to thank you for hosting the service chiefs last week.  I appreciated your comments to them about the inefficiencies and the dangers of continued budget instability and gridlock, as well as the risk of sequestration’s looming return.  I look forward to addressing those topics, more, today with you. I also appreciate your support for our men and women serving around the world, military and civilian alike, you always provide it.  They are the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  They’re the – no one else in the world is stronger, no one is more capable, more innovative, more experienced, and has better friends and allies than they.  That’s a fact – a fact that Americans ought to be proud of. As you know, DoD is currently addressing each of the five challenges that Chairman Dunford and I described to you in our budget testimony this spring, and that the Chairman and Senator Reed already touched on – namely, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism.  And on the last, in the wake of this week’s attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, we remain as determined as ever to continue countering terrorists around the world who seek to do harm to our country and our personnel – more on that shortly. As Chairman Dunford and I testified this spring, we’ve been planning for our activities to be paid for by the 2017 budget that we have submitted and that we developed.  That budget adhered to last fall’s bipartisan budget deal in overall size, while in shape, it marked a strategic turning point for DoD – making breakthrough investments in new operational concepts, in pioneering technological frontiers, in reforming the DoD enterprise, and in building the force of the future.  It also put a high premium on continuing to rebuild the readiness of our forces – requiring not only stable resources, but also time.  Nothing is more important than readiness to me or to the service chiefs.  And yet today, just eight days away from the end of this fiscal year, that budget has yet to be funded by Congress. I want to discuss that with you today, but because this hearing is partly about ongoing military operations, let me begin with an operational update on our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat. Now, each time Chairman Dunford and I have appeared before this committee since back last October, I’ve described to you our coalition military campaign plan, which is focused on three objectives.  The first is to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, because the sooner we end ISIL’s occupation of territory in those countries – that is, the sooner we destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology – the safer all of the world will be.  And that’s necessary, absolutely necessary, it’s not sufficient.  So our second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world…in Afghanistan, Libya, and elsewhere.  And our third objective is to help protect the homeland.  This is mainly the responsibility of our partners in the FBI, the Justice Department, Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community, and state and local law enforcement, but DoD strongly supports them, and I’ll address how momentarily. Since last fall, we’ve taken many steps to continually accelerate this campaign – all consistent with our strategic approach of enabling capable, motivated local forces, for that’s the only way to ensure ISIL’s lasting defeat.  And while we have much more work to do, the results of our effort are showing. In Iraq, we’ve been enabling the Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga.  After retaking Ramadi and establishing a staging base at Makhmour, the ISF went on to take – retake Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, and the important airfield and town of Qayyarah – setting the stage to complete the envelopment of Mosul and the collapse ISIL’s control over it.  In the last few days, the ISF became – began operations to retake Sharqat and other towns surrounding Mosul.  And the final assault on Mosul will commence – as with previous operations – when Prime Minister Abadi gives the order. In Syria, our coalition has also enabled considerable results by our local partners.  They retook Shaddadi – severing a key link between Raqqa and Mosul – and then Manbij City – clearing a key transit point for ISIL’s external operations and plotters, and providing key intelligence insights.  Additionally, our ally Turkey is helping local Syrian partners clear their border region [of] ISIL.  We’re working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Turks, supporting these efforts from the air, on the ground, and with intelligence.  And as we do so, we’re managing regional tensions – tensions that we’ve foreseen – and keeping everyone focused on our common enemy:  ISIL. Meanwhile, we’re systematically eliminating ISIL’s leadership, with the coalition having taken out seven members of the ISIL Senior Shura, including its Chief of External Operations, Al-Adnani.  He was one of more than 20 ISIL external operators and plotters we’ve removed from the battlefield. We’re also continuing to go after ISIL’s attempts to develop chemical weapons – as we continue to ensure that U.S., coalition, and Iraqi troops are vigilantly protected from that threat.  And just last week, in one of the single largest airstrikes of our campaign, we destroyed a pharmaceutical facility near Mosul that ISIL tried to use as a chemical weapons plant.  We also continue to aggressively attack ISIL’s economic infrastructure – oil wells, tanker trucks, cash storage, and more.  And we continue to take the fight to ISIL across every domain, including cyber. With all this, we’re putting ISIL on the path to a lasting defeat in Iraq and Syria – particularly as we embark on a decisive phase of our campaign, to collapse ISIL’s control of Mosul and Raqqa. With respect to the Syrian civil war, I’m gonna commend Secretary Kerry for working so tirelessly to seek an arrangement which, if implemented, would ease the suffering of the Syrian people and get Russia pushing at last for a political transition, which is the only way to end the Syrian civil war.  There remains a way to go to see if the terms of that arrangement can be implemented – unfortunately the behavior we’ve seen from Russia and Syria over the last few days has been deeply problematic. Let me turn to our second objective, combatting ISIL’s metastases.  In Libya, thanks to U.S. precision airstrikes undertaken at the request of the Government of National Accord, ISIL’s territory in Sirte has now been reduced to a single square kilometer…and I’m confident ISIL will be ejected from there.  Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, we worked with our Afghan partners to conduct a large operation against ISIL over the last two months – dealing the organization severe blows, killing its top leader, and degrading its infrastructure, logistics base, and recruiting.  And there’ll be more coming. Next, to help protect our homeland and our people, DoD continues to provide strong support to our law enforcement, homeland security, and intelligence partners.  This is the number-one mission of our Northern Command.  And the U.S. military is supporting our partners in three critical ways.  First, we’re ensuring the protection of our personnel and the DoD facilities where they work and reside.  Second, we’re disrupting ISIL’s external operations – more on that shortly.  And third, we’re also disrupting the flow of foreign fighters both to and from Iraq and Syria.  This is part of a broader effort within our coalition to not only stem the flow of foreign fighters, but also counter ISIL’s online messaging, recruitment, and spread of its loathsome ideology. Going forward, the collapse of ISIL’s control over Raqqa and Mosul – which we’re confident our coalition will achieve – will indeed put ISIL on an irreversible path to lasting defeat.  But after that, to take up a point that both the Chairman and Ranking Member Reed made, there will still be much more to do.  Political challenges will remain.  For that reason, the international coalition’s stabilization efforts cannot be allowed to lag behind our military progress.  That’s critical to making sure that ISIL, once defeated, stays defeated. Truly delivering ISIL a lasting defeat requires both strategic patience and persistence.  We can’t predict what will come after our coalition defeats ISIL, so we must be ready for anything – including any attempts by ISIL to remain relevant, even if only in the darkest corners of the Internet. Let me now address issues DoD faces as an institution, and how you can help. We have three grave concerns related to processes here in Congress:  one, budget gridlock and instability; two, micromanagement and over-regulation; and three, denial of needed reforms.  As you’ve heard consistently from me and DoD senior leaders, all three are serious concerns.  But here today, because of how close we are to the end of the fiscal year, I want to focus just on the first. We need Congress to come together around providing normal, stable, responsible budgets because the lack of stability represents one of the single biggest strategic risks to our enterprise at DoD.  That’s why I’ve been talking about the major risks posed by budget instability for over a year and a half.  You heard the same from the service chiefs last week. Such budget instability undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars – often in ways taxpayers can’t even see.  It baffles our friends, emboldens our foes.  It’s managerially and strategically unsound, and it’s unfairly dispiriting to our troops, for their families, and our workforce.  And it’s inefficient for our defense industry partners, too. We’re now eight days away from the end of the fiscal year, but instead of stability, we’re going into Fiscal Year 2017 with yet another continuing resolution…this for the eighth fiscal year in a row.  That’s a deplorable state of affairs – and Chairman McCain, I appreciate your comments to our service chiefs about the damage a CR can do to our institution.  As you know, the longer a continuing resolution lasts, the more damaging it is.  It’s not just a matter of money, but where the dollars are.  For example, a CR that goes past December would undermine our plan to quadruple our European Reassurance Initiative at a time, as the Chairman already alluded, when we need to be standing with our NATO allies and standing up to deter Russian aggression. I know you will return here in November to pass defense appropriations and a National Defense Authorization Act; I look forward to working with you then.  However, I cannot support any approach to the defense budget that moves us toward sequestration, or away from bipartisanship.  And not at the expense of stability that comes with it.  Not if it shortchanges the needs of our warfighters.  Not if it means funding lower priorities instead of higher priorities.  Not if it undermines confidence in the ability to pass bipartisan budget deals, which could lead to the imposition of sequestration’s $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts to us.  And not if it adds extra force structure that we can’t afford to keep ready in the long-term, which would only lead to a hollow force. I’m confident, and hopeful, that we can come back together again.  Today, America is fortunate to have the world’s greatest military.  I know it, you know it, our friends and allies know it, and critically, our potential adversaries know it too.  Only with your help can we ensure that my successors can say the same, and that what is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known remains that way for years to come. Thank you. ","Opening Statement on ""U.S. National Security Challenges and Ongoing Military Operations"" before the Senate Armed Services Committee",https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/953317/opening-statement-on-us-national-security-challenges-and-ongoing-military-opera/
"Feb. 25, 2016","I. PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, Members of the Committee:  Thank you for inviting me here today, and for your steadfast support for the men and women of the Department of Defense (DoD), military and civilian alike, who serve and defend our country all over the world.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget submission for the Defense Department. At this time last year, we were all facing the bleak prospect of looming budget sequestration, and the damage its return would do to our people and our mission.  I’m grateful that our country’s leaders were able to come together last fall to avert that dismal future, and reach a budget deal that – after several years of fiscal turmoil and reductions – has allowed for greater investment in all our elements of national security and strength.  That was what I urged since becoming Secretary of Defense, including in last year’s budget testimony before this committee, and given the threat environment we face around the world, forging that deal was the responsible thing to do.  It allows our military personnel and their families to know their future more than just one year at a time, which they deserve.  It lets our defense industry partners be more efficient and cutting edge, as we need them to be.  And, perhaps most importantly, it sends a signal to the world – to friends and potential foes alike – of our nation’s strength and resolve. The President’s budget submission accordingly adheres to that budget deal – requesting a total of $582.7 billion for the Defense Department in FY 2017, for both the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds combined.  How we plan to invest those funds, along with our planned investments for the next five years – as detailed in the customary Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that’s included in the President’s budget submission – are critical to DoD’s ability to carry out our mission of national defense with the excellence the American people expect of their military, which is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. As you know, no one got everything they wanted in the budget deal – I said last year that we needed to rise above our differences, and I’m glad many members of Congress were able to do that – so in budgeting and programming for FY 2017, we had to make responsible choices.  The President’s budget submission reflects those choices, and we need your support for them.  This is particularly true for prudent and necessary reforms – some of which the Congress has long denied, in spite of the cost to both DoD and to America’s taxpayers.  Indeed, while DoD is grateful to this and the other defense committees for your support for the budget deal, it is also the defense committees that in recent years have been tying our hands on reform, as I will address later in this testimony. We should remember, however, that the budget deal only covered two years.  Unless Congress addresses the years beyond it and heads off sequestration, DoD will face $100 billion in cuts from 2018 to 2021, which would introduce unacceptable risks.  So Washington will need to come together once again – not unlike last year, and two years before that – to provide stability and protect our national security. That’s important, because in this budget submission, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we must fight and win today’s fights, we must also be prepared to deter and if necessary fight and win the fights that might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal set the size of our budget, thereby allowing us to focus on the shape – making choices and tradeoffs to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future.  II. A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT Let me now describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe, as we have been since the end of World War II.  As we fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era. Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused on large-scale counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DoD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full-spectrum warfighting.  While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it’s also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL, and the resurgence of Russia, being just the most prominent examples. This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we’ve seen in history following major wars.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different – and more diverse and complex in the scope of its challenges – than the one we’ve been engaged with for the last 25 years, and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. Accordingly, five evolving challenges are now driving the focus of DoD’s planning and budgeting. Two of these challenges reflect a recognition of – return to, in some ways – great power competition.  This is something we haven’t seen for some time, and that requires heightened focus given its potential impact on our nation and the world.  The first such challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  The second is in the Asia-Pacific, where we haven’t faced great power competition since the end of World War II, and where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, where we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  One is North Korea, which remains dangerous to both us and our allies – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran – because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and doesn’t limit DoD in any way, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Challenge number five, no less important than the other four, is our ongoing fight to counter terrorism, and especially defeat ISIL – most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also where it is metastasizing, in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere – at the same time as we’re protecting our homeland.  While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective and in our budgeting we must also take into account that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, countering terrorists will be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of DoD and other national security leaders. DoD must and will address all five of these challenges as part of its mission to defend this country.  Doing so requires some new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities. Key to our approach is being able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  This means we must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action, or make them deeply regret it if they do.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we are able to win, on our terms.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict. We have this ability with respect to North Korean and Iranian military forces, as well as in executing the military aspects of countering terrorists, as we’re doing now against ISIL.  That won’t change, even as we know that military power alone cannot prevail – nor can the United States alone deliver a lasting defeat – against the toxic ideology of terrorists like ISIL that have so little regard for the lives of fellow human beings. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and are continuing to advance military systems that threaten our advantages in specific areas, and in some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives in ways they hope would preempt a response by the United States.  Because of these facts, because the implications of any great-power conflict would be so dire for the United States and the world, and because of those nations’ actions to date – from Ukraine to the South China Sea – DoD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting to ensure we maintain our advantages in the future. While we do not desire conflict with any of these nations – and, to be clear, though they pose some similar defense challenges, they are very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they choose to pursue.  That is the responsible course of action for the Defense Department.  Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and even as we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them, which is itself a key part of deterrence. Our military must be balanced with the proper size and capability to defeat any attack against U.S. forces and our allies.  And because of the decisions in this budget, our military will be better prepared for both present and future challenges, and better positioned to deter, and if necessary fight and win, wars against even the most high-end of potential adversaries. As this budget addresses those five evolving challenges, it also seizes great opportunities – in supporting new and innovative operational concepts; in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, including undersea, cyber, space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities; in reforming the defense enterprise; and in building the force of the future.  I will address the investments we’re making to do so later in this testimony.  III. SUPPORTING THE STRENGTH AND WELLNESS OF TODAY’S FIGHTING FORCE Before I address how this budget ensures we meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, I want to first emphasize our enduring commitment to supporting the men, women, and families of the world’s finest fighting force.  Above all, this means exercising the utmost care in decisions involving the deployment and employment of our troops.  It also requires devoting a significant share of our budget every year toward supporting the people, military and civilian alike, who execute DoD’s missions around the world. To ensure we have a force that’s ready to carry out today’s missions, this budget invests in the four main things that every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine needs to do their job – the right training; the right equipment; the right force size, meaning the right number of people alongside them; and the right compensation. The Right Training In FY 2017 and beyond, the budget makes critical investments in training throughout the force to rebuild toward full-spectrum combat readiness and continue recovering from the damage caused by sequestration in recent years – though, it’s important to remember that restoring readiness requires not only sufficient funding, but also time.  The budget maximizes use of the Army’s decisive action Combat Training Centers, funding 19 total Army brigade-level training rotations.  It largely sustains the Navy and Marine Corps’ current training and readiness levels for FY 2017 – optimizing Navy training while maximizing the availability of naval forces for global operations, and fully funding the Marine Corps’ integrated combined arms exercises for all elements of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  And, because recent operational demands like the fight against ISIL have slowed the Air Force’s return to full-spectrum readiness, the budget increases funding – as part of a $1 billion increase over the FYDP to support Air Force readiness – to modernize and expand existing Air Force training ranges and exercises here at home, providing pilots and airmen with more realistic training opportunities when they’re not deployed. The Right Equipment The budget also makes important investments to provide our men and women in uniform with functioning, well-maintained equipment so that when we send them into the fights of today, they’re able to accomplish their mission and come home safely.  For example, to address the Navy and Marine Corps’ growing maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15-percent increase in F-18 depot maintenance capacity, and it buys an additional 16 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and FY 2018 – providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps’ 4th-generation fighter aircraft fleet so it’s ready and capable for today’s missions.  To help ensure the Air Force has enough ready and capable aircraft for both combat missions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), the budget funds improvements in the avionics and electronic warfare systems of legacy fighter and bomber aircraft, and it supports the Air Force’s ‘get well plan’ for remotely-piloted aircraft. The budget also makes critical investments in every domain to research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and equipment our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  I will detail those investments later in this testimony. The Right Force Size The flexibility provided by last fall’s budget deal allowed us to maintain DoD’s desired targets across the FYDP for end-strength and active-reserve mix for our ground forces – without it, sequestration likely would have forced further reductions.  Therefore, the budget stabilizes our total ground force end-strength by the end of FY 2018 with an Army of 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 56 total Army brigade combat teams and associated enablers – and a Marine Corps of 182,000 active-duty Marines and 38,500 Marine reservists.  For the Navy, the budget continues to grow the size, and importantly the capability, of the battle fleet – providing for 380,900 active-duty and reserve sailors in FY 2017, and an increase from 280 ships at the end of FY 2016 to 308 ships at the end of the FYDP.  The budget also supports an Air Force of 491,700 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard airmen – maintaining 55 tactical fighter squadrons over the next five years, and providing sufficient manpower to address high operating tempo and shortfalls in maintenance specialists for both tactical fighters and remotely-piloted aircraft. The Right Compensation In FY 2017, the budget provides $177.9 billion in pay and benefits – including health care, housing allowances, commissaries, retirement, and other benefits – for DoD’s 2.1 million military personnel and their families.  I will discuss DoD’s proposed reforms to some of these areas later in this testimony.  To help make sure DoD is competitive for the best talent, the budget includes a department-wide pay raise of 1.6 percent in FY 2017.  This is an increase above FY 2016’s pay raise of 1.3 percent. It’s important to note that of all the cuts we’ve taken to our previously-planned budgets since the Budget Control Act was passed, including cuts from sequestration – altogether so far totaling at least $800 billion over ten years – less than 9 percent of those reductions came from military compensation proposals.  This should make clear that we’ve worked extremely hard to protect our people, and that we do need to address some places where savings can be found, such as through modernizing and simplifying our military healthcare system, which I address later in this testimony. More Than Military Readiness Beyond ensuring the combat readiness of America’s military, our commitment to the force of today also encompasses what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people.  We’re putting a priority on preventing and eliminating sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, investing $246 million in FY 2017 to help support survivors, reduce retaliation for reporting, and eradicate these crimes from our ranks – and soon, DoD will deliver to Congress our strategy on addressing retaliation, in particular.  We’re also helping provide transition support and advocating for employment opportunities for veterans, investing a total of $109 million in FY 2017 so our people can make the most of their potential and keep making a difference when they complete their service in uniform.  And we’re fostering greater diversity of our force, because our strength depends on being open to the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards – young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, and open, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. That’s one reason why we’re opening all remaining combat positions to women, so that we have access to 50 percent of our population for every position in the all-volunteer force, and every American who can meet our exacting standards has the full and equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  That said, since the declaration that opens all career fields to women is by itself not sufficient for their full integration, I’ve asked the military services to mitigate any concerns about combat effectiveness by incorporating my seven guiding principles – transparent standards, population size, talent management, physical demands and physiological differences, operating abroad, conduct and culture, and assessment and adjustment – into their implementation plans.  First and foremost, this means the services will continue to apply objective standards for all career fields to ensure leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.  This may mean in some cases, equal opportunity may not always equate to equal participation.  Integration provides equal opportunity for men and women who can perform the tasks required; it does not guarantee women will fill these roles in any specific number or at any set rate, as adherence to a merit-based system must continue to be paramount.  Also, we must incorporate concrete ways to mitigate the potential for higher injury rates among women, and leverage lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan to address concerns regarding operating in areas where there is cultural resistance to working with women.  We must address attitudes toward team performance through education and training, including making clear that sexual assault or harassment, hazing, and unprofessional behaviors are never acceptable.  Our core beliefs in good order, discipline, leadership, and accountability are foundational to our success in integration.  And it is absolutely critical that we embark on integration with a commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and in-stride adjustment that enables sustainable success. Finally, it’s important to remember that our commitment to the force of today is not limited to those who serve in uniform.  In FY 2017, it also includes $79.3 billion to support our civilian workforce of 718,000 Americans – men and women across the country and around the world who do critical jobs like helping repair our ships and airplanes, providing logistics support, developing and acquiring weapon systems, supporting survivors of sexual assault, and helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured personnel.  The budget includes $7.7 billion to support our military families, because they serve too.  It includes $3.1 billion to help take care of our wounded warriors, to whom our commitment is and must remain as strong as ever.  And it includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  IV. ADJUSTING TO STRATEGIC CHANGE Another significant portion of our budget goes toward DoD’s current operations all around the world, in every domain, to help defend our country, our allies, and our interests.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to helping the President address key national security challenges, and my priorities for how we must adjust to strategic change – in countering terrorists, whether ISIL, al-Qaeda, or others; in taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression; in operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; in deterring Iranian aggression and malign influence; in standing alert on the Korean Peninsula; and in addressing threats from multiple directions in cyber, space, and electronic warfare. Countering Terrorism It is clear that our mission of countering terrorists and other violent extremists around the world will be with us for some time.  The Department of Defense has strong counterterrorism capabilities, and we continue to deploy them to protect America. Dealing ISIL a Lasting Defeat We must and will deal ISIL a lasting defeat, which is why the budget provides $7.5 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Inherent Resolve.  This investment will be critical to continuing to implement and accelerate the coalition military campaign plan that the United States has developed, that our key allies support, and that focuses on three military objectives:  One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by attacking its two power centers in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria; these cities constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic and ideological centers of gravity, which is why our plan has big arrows pointing toward both.  Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear.  And three, our most important mission, which is to protect the homeland. To eliminate the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, DoD is enabling local, motivated forces with critical support from a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities-ranging from airstrikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice and assistance.  It must be local forces who deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, because only they can secure and govern the territory by building long-term trust within the populations they liberate.  We can and will enable such local forces, but we cannot substitute for them.  Accordingly, the budget’s investment in the counter-ISIL campaign includes $630 million for training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces, and $250 million for enabling Syrian anti-ISIL forces. This is a worthy investment, as we’ve already started to see our investments over the last several months start to pay off.  For example, it was Iraqi soldiers who took back the Ramadi city center, reversing a loss the Iraqi army suffered last spring.  Our support to them included advanced training, tactics, air support, and the portable bridges that carried the Iraqi military across the Euphrates River and into the decisive fight.  Ramadi, like recent Iraqi gains in Bayji, Tikrit, and Sinjar all demonstrate the approach we are taking is having an effect as Iraqis prepare for what will be a tough fight for Mosul.  Likewise in Syria, local anti-ISIL forces we’ve enabled with equipment and ammunition have had successes in Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, and the Tishreen Dam.  It is imperative to keep building on this momentum. As we work with our partners to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas like North and West Africa and Afghanistan.  Having taken out ISIL’s leader in Libya in November, we are also now prepared to step up pressure on ISIL in Afghanistan to check their ambitions there as well. Finally, at the same time that we accelerate our campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners – there can be no free riders.  That’s why earlier this month in Brussels I convened the first-ever meeting of defense ministers from 27 other countries involved in the military coalition to defeat ISIL to follow up after I personally reached out to dozens of defense ministers to urge them to consider filling critical military and non-military needs in the campaign.  And I’m gratified to report that coalition members responded to our challenge – and not only NATO allies like Canada and the Netherlands, but also Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  In sum, nearly 90 percent of the countries participating in the coalition's military campaign have either stepped up their role or committed to do so in the coming days.  Their decisions to expand air operations, send more trainers, provide logistical support, help with reconstruction, or make other contributions will all help our coalition intensify the counter-ISIL campaign and bring about ISIL’s lasting defeat. None of this changes the fact that our counter-ISIL campaign is a hard and complex fight.  We have tactical and strategic goals, but they will take time – and, as is often said, the enemy gets a vote.  For our part, we will remain focused, committed, and resilient because this is a fight we can, must, and will win, as our efforts to accelerate our campaign are already producing real and promising results. Ensuring Long-Term Stability in Afghanistan After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan, we have to make sure our gains there stick, which is why the budget continues to support our two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).  In support of those two missions, the President announced last fall that the United States will maintain a continued presence of 9,800 troops through most of 2016 before drawing down to 5,500 troops by January 2017.  As I told our troops there when I visited them this past December, while Afghanistan remains a dynamic fight, we are determined to ensure that terrorists – regardless of whether they’re al-Qaeda or ISIL – never have or find safe haven there again. The budget provides $41.7 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel – including funding to support our posture in U.S. Central Command, the full funding of $3.4 billion to support the ANDSF, and $1.4 billion to support other coalition partners.  Importantly, this allows us to continue strengthening and developing the ANDSF’s aviation, logistics, intelligence, and special operations capabilities, with the intent of reducing their dependency on us over time.  Also, in addition to upholding our commitments to Afghanistan, the Afghan people, and other partners, the budget reflects that the United States will retain several key locations in 2016 and beyond, including facilities in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.  As we do so, the United States will support the continuation of the NATO mission in Afghanistan in 2016 and beyond, and continue to consult with our NATO allies and partners to ensure that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan are mutually supportive. Our continued presence in Afghanistan is not only a sensible investment to counter threats that exist and stay ahead of those that could emerge in this volatile region; it also supports the willing partner we have in the government of Afghanistan.  It is in the United States’ interest to help them succeed, for the benefit of their security, our security, the region and the world. Closing the Detention Facility at Guantanamo The Defense Department is resolutely committed to responsibly closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  I share the President’s belief – and the belief of many in Congress – that doing so would benefit our national security, which is why DoD will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when appropriate, such as when we have substantially mitigated any security risks to the United States. Over the last three months, we completed transfers for 16 detainees, bringing the population to 91.  Like every transfer that came before them, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government. That said, because many of the remaining detainees currently cannot be safely transferred to another country, we need an alternative to this detention facility.  Therefore, I support the President’s plan to establish and bring those detainees to an appropriate, secure, alternative location in the United States.  I appreciate that Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal, and, in accordance with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD delivered that plan to Congress earlier this week.  We look forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate design, legislative foundation, and geographic location for future detention and to lift the restrictions preventing the responsible closure of the facility at Guantanamo. Supporting and Maintaining our Counterterrorism Capabilities In addition to the specific funds outlined above, the budget also reflects other investments we’re making in DoD’s posture to ensure we can counter terrorism effectively wherever it challenges us.  For example, the budget sustains our robust funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, allocating $10.8 billion in FY 2017.  To bolster our partners in fighting terrorism, it requests $1 billion for our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  And it supports the development of DoD’s transregional counterterrorism strategy, which I’d like to outline now. The terrorist threat is continually evolving, changing focus and shifting location, requiring us to be flexible, nimble, and far-reaching in our response.  Accordingly, the Defense Department is leveraging the existing security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe, so that we can counter transnational and transregional terrorist threats like ISIL and others in a sustainable, durable way going forward.  From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain last October, to those I visited in Jalalabad, Afghanistan last December, these locations and associated forces in various regions help keep us postured to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds.  In a practical sense, they enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent terrorist group affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the main entities themselves.  This transregional approach is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this in action was our November strike on Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill him.  To help implement this strategy, including in the fight against ISIL and its metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, the budget includes an additional $175 million in FY 2017 – $9 million to help bolster our posture in the Levant, and $166 million to help us better address threats in North and West Africa in conjunction with our European partners. Because the accelerating intensity of our precision air campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria has been depleting our stocks of some of the GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets we use against terrorists the most, the budget invests $1.8 billion in FY 2017 to buy over 45,000 more of them.  Furthermore, DoD is also exploring increasing the production rate of these munitions in our industrial base – calling on America’s great arsenal of democracy to help us and our partners finish the job of defeating ISIL. Also, because our remotely-piloted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft play an important role in countering terrorism, the budget includes $1.2 billion for FY 2017 and $4.5 billion over the FYDP to increase the number of around-the-clock permissive ISR combat air patrols from 70 today to 90 by the end of FY 2018.  Using a mix of MQ-9 Reapers, Extended Range Reapers, and MQ-1C Advanced Gray Eagles – and comprising 60 patrols from the Air Force, 16 from the Army, and 14 that are government-owned and flown by contractors for the Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command – these investments will be critical as the need for ISR continues to increase around the world. Finally, because it helps us maintain a larger Air Force fighter fleet that can drop more smart bombs in our counter-ISIL air campaign, the budget also further defers the A-10 Thunderbolt’s final retirement until 2022.  I saw some of the A-10s that are flying bombing missions against ISIL when I was at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey last December, and we need the additional payload capacity they can bring to the fight.  Accordingly, we are also changing the rate at which we will phase out the A-10 as we approach 2022, as I will explain later in this testimony. A Strong and Balanced Strategic Approach to Deter Russia Despite the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community, and also Russia itself so well for so long.  In Europe, Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  In Syria, Russia has been pouring gasoline on a civil war that fuels the very extremism Russia claims to oppose.  At sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow’s nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to brandishing nuclear weapons. To be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy, even as it may view us that way.  But make no mistake – we will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all.  That’s why the United States is taking a strong and balanced strategic approach in response to Russia’s aggression:  strengthening both our allies and ourselves, including through investments in this budget, while also giving Russia the opportunity, if it chooses, to rejoin the international community and work with us where our interests align. Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, DoD’s budgets have made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies; for example, contributing to NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  This budget builds on that significantly, and breaks new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterring – and, if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future.  The 20th century NATO playbook was successful in working toward a Europe whole, free and at peace, but the same playbook would not be well-matched to the needs of the 21st century.  Together with our NATO allies, we must write a new playbook which includes preparing to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, better integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to adapt and respond to new challenges and new threats. To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative to make a total investment of $3.4 billion for FY 2017 – more than quadrupling the $789 million that we requested last year – allowing us to increase the amount of prepositioned equipment sets in Europe as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies.  This increase supports the persistent rotational presence of an armored brigade combat team for 12 months out of the year, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European friends and allies.  It supports more warfighting gear, including forward-stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017.  It supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such that this equipment – along with assigned Army airborne and Stryker brigade combat teams and Marine Corps heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – will allow us to rapidly form a highly-capable combined-arms ground force of division-plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C tactical fighter squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft. In addition, the budget reflects how we’re doing more, and in more ways, with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, this includes building toward a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap up to Norway’s North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe’s first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to our British allies.  And, given Russia’s use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – the budget supports more rotational presence of U.S. special operations forces exercising in Europe. The budget also significantly funds important new technologies that, when coupled with revised operational concepts, will ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  While I will address these areas in greater detail later in this testimony, investments that are most relevant to deterring Russia include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-range anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber, and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for electronic warfare, space, and cyberspace.  The budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent. Consistent with our strong and balanced approach, the door will remain open for Russia to reassume the role of respected partner going forward.  While that would be greatly welcomed by the United States, and the Department of Defense, it’s up to the Kremlin to decide – first by demonstrating a willingness to return to the international community. Operationalizing the Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific The budget also supports operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.  In a region home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy, for 70 years the United States has helped underwrite a stable security environment that allowed the people, economies, and countries in the Asia-Pacific to rise and prosper.  We fully intend to continue these efforts so that bright future can be possible for everyone in this important region. Accordingly, the budget helps improve DoD’s geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable posture in the region, through which the United States seeks to preserve peace and stability, and maintain our strategic advantage in an area that’s critically important to America’s political, economic, and security interests.  Investments in the budget reflect how we’re moving more of our forces to the region – such as 60 percent of our Navy and overseas Air Force assets – and also some of our most advanced capabilities in and around the region, from F-22 stealth fighter jets and other advanced tactical strike aircraft, to P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, to our newest surface warfare ships.  They also reflect how we’re developing and implementing new posture initiatives – in places like Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore, as well as modernizing our existing footprint in Korea and Japan.  And they reflect our efforts to support and strengthen a regional security architecture that benefits everyone – from strengthening and modernizing our alliances, to bolstering our ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to building the security capabilities of our many friends and allies, who increasingly want to do more with us in the region.  In support of this effort, the budget fully supports our five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative begun in FY 2016. For this region, as it does with Europe, the budget also significantly funds important new technologies to ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These investments – which I will outline later in this testimony – are important for ensuring our forces can go anywhere, at any time, and succeed in whatever mission we ask of them. It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, because it’s good for the region and good for our collective interests.  That includes China.  As we welcome the growth and prosperity of all Asia-Pacific nations, it is clear that the U.S.-China relationship will be complex as we continue to balance our competition and cooperation.  There are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China – for example, we’ve agreed to four confidence-building agreements, including one meant to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  But there remain areas of concern. For one, the United States joins virtually everyone else in the region in being deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  U.S. military presence in the region is decades-old, has been instrumental in upholding the rules-based international system, and has laid the foundation for peace and security in the region.  Our interest is in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight, full and unimpeded lawful commerce, and that disputes are resolved peacefully.  To accomplish this, we will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  We also expect China to uphold President Xi’s pledge not to pursue militarization in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. Also, we are closely watching the long-term, comprehensive military modernization program that China, as well as other countries, continues to pursue.  While there is no question that the United States retains a decisive military edge in the Asia-Pacific today, China is investing in capabilities to counter third-party – including the United States – intervention during a crisis or conflict.  These capabilities include ballistic and cruise missiles of increasingly greater range and accuracy, counter-space and offensive cyber capabilities, and electronic warfare systems.  To maintain a lasting competitive advantage, DoD is taking prudent steps to preserve and enhance deterrence for the long term.  The budget reflects this, including with investments to continue adapting our forces, posture, operations, and capabilities to deter aggression, defend our allies, and sustain our military edge in the Asia-Pacific. Deterring North Korea The budget also supports investments necessary to deter North Korean provocation and aggression, ensure our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready and capable to ‘fight tonight’ if necessary, and defend against threats emanating from North Korea against the United States and our allies.  This includes threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, against which DoD is fully capable of defending the U.S. homeland.  Our position has been, and remains, that North Korea must abide by its international obligation to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and stop its provocative behavior. North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6th and its ballistic missile launch on February 7th were highly provocative acts that undermine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.  The United States condemns these violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again calls on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.  We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. DoD remains fully capable of fulfilling U.S. treaty commitments to our allies in the event of a North Korean attack, and we’re working with our Republic of Korea allies to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat.  I spoke with my South Korean counterpart shortly after the nuclear test, and reiterated our commitments as strong and steadfast allies.  Also, a few hours after the ballistic missile launch, the United States and the Republic of Korea jointly announced the start of formal consultations to discuss the feasibility of deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the Korean Peninsula at the earliest date. Checking Iran’s Malign Influence while Strengthening Regional Friends and Allies The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges, but there, as everywhere, DoD’s budget – and accordingly our actions and strong military posture – is guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s interests.  Defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria, which I discussed earlier, is of course one of those interests, but amid this region’s complexity and uncertainty, we also have other interests of great importance, which are to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; and to check Iran’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  That’s why DoD maintains tens of thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along with our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action places significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, it does not limit in any way what DoD can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance.  So if Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can immediately respond and rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. This budget invests in maintaining those abilities going forward, which is important, because Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is contributing to disorder in Yemen, while still directing hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel.  To continue to meet our commitments and enhance our cooperation with our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, the budget makes critical investments – including $146 million to support Israel in FY 2017.  This reflects our unshakeable commitment to Israel and its security, with funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow, and other cooperative defense programs – not only ensuring that Israel can defend itself, but also preserving and enhancing Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is a cornerstone of our defense relationship. Meanwhile, with critical investments in other areas, the budget enables DoD to continue to advance our preparations, posture, partnerships, and planning to preserve the President’s options for any contingency.  It strengthens the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran’s ability to coerce its neighbors.  And it helps us stay ahead of the risks posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, naval forces, cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the region. Addressing Threats in Cyber, Space, and Electronic Warfare Even as we make adjustments in our budget to address the five evolving challenges posed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda, we are also making adjustments to address emerging and increasing threats that transcend individual nations and organizations.  That’s because, as we confront these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also led to vulnerabilities that potential adversaries are eager to exploit. As I made clear when I released DoD’s new cyber strategy last April, we have three missions in cyberspace – first and foremost, to defend our networks, systems, and information; second, to defend the nation and our interests from cyberattacks of significant consequence; and third, to provide options that can augment our other military systems.  Given the increasing severity and sophistication of the threats and challenges we’re seeing in cyberspace – ranging from ISIL’s pervasive online presence to the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management – the budget puts a priority on funding our cyber strategy, investing a total of $6.7 billion in FY 2017 and $34.6 billion over the FYDP.  This is a $900 million increase over last year’s budget.  While these funds will help us continue to develop, train, and equip our growing Cyber Mission Force, and also make new technological investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and capabilities – both of which I address later in this testimony – the budget also reflects our efforts to make a fundamental shift toward a culture of accountability in cyberspace, from instituting a DoD-wide cybersecurity scorecard to monitor our progress to increasing individual knowledge about practical ways to defend against cyber intrusions.  Our people understandably hold themselves to very high standards when it comes to caring for, attending to, using, and being accountable for the weapons they carry into battle, and we must do the same when it comes to interacting with our networks and cyber capabilities – not only among our cyber warriors and IT professionals, but throughout the DoD workforce. While at times in the past space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that’s not the case anymore, and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  This means that as we continue to ensure our access to space so we can provide capabilities like reconnaissance, GPS, and secure communications that enable and enhance our operations in other domains, we must also focus on assuring and defending these capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs of others.  Though competitors may understand our reliance on space, we will not let them use it against us, or take it away.  As I will discuss later in this testimony, this budget makes important investments to do just that – sustaining and building on the major shifts DoD began funding in last year’s budget submission.  With the presence of so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet:  free and open to all. Finally, high-end competitors have also invested in electronic warfare systems as a cost-effective way to challenge the United States and try to blunt our technological advantage.  By jamming our radars, communications, and GPS, these systems would seek to disrupt the integrated capabilities that allow our forces to identify, target, reach, and destroy an enemy with precision.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why this budget deliberately invests in buying more electronic protection and resiliency for our current systems as well as developing more advanced capabilities.  I will address these investments in more detail later in this testimony.  V. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE The other significant share of our budget goes toward making sure DoD will be ready for the future.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to create a Defense Department that’s open to change and new ideas to ensure a better future for both DoD and the nation, and my priorities in doing so.  These are best understood through the four key pillars of this commitment – namely, updating and refining warfighting strategies, operational concepts, and tactics; driving smart and essential technological innovation; building the force of the future; and reforming the DoD enterprise. While I will describe what we’re doing in each of those areas momentarily, the dynamic strategic environment I described earlier in this testimony explains why such change is so important – not for the sake of change, but for the security of this country.  We cannot let those challenges overtake us; we have to stay ahead of them and stay the best.  That’s why as Secretary of Defense I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box. Updating and Refining Warfighting Strategies, Operational Concepts, and Tactics Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win both the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, and to make sure that the plans apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats to our security, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  We’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners think about what happens if they have to execute their plan at the same time as another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into the trap of presuming the contingency they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  And we’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we must be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them. As I mentioned earlier, DoD is continuing to embark on a force-wide, all-service transition from an era focused on counterinsurgency operations to an era focused on the full spectrum of military operations.  While we do so for many important reasons, it’s also important to note that we don’t want to forget or turn our back on counterinsurgency, but rather enable most of our forces to be capable of doing a lot more than just that.  A smaller segment of our force will still specialize in these skills, and DoD will retain the ability to expand our operational capacity for counterinsurgency missions should it become necessary. The transition to full-spectrum operations is and will be coupled with demonstrations to clearly signal it and make that signal credible, which is key to conventional deterrence.  The same is true for our investments in capabilities – in new technologies, new operational concepts, and also innovative ways for how we use what we already have – these must and will be demonstrated as well.  This is accounted for in the budget, as are other investments we’re making to recommit ourselves to deterrence across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict. Recognizing the immense value that wargaming has historically had in strengthening our force in times of strategic, operational, and technological transition – such as during the interwar years between World War I and World War II, when air, land, and naval wargamers developed innovative approaches in areas like tank warfare and carrier aviation – this budget makes significant new investments to reinvigorate and expand wargaming efforts across the Defense Department.  With a total of $55 million in FY 2017 as part of $526 million over the FYDP, this will allow us to try out nascent operational concepts and test new capabilities that may create operational dilemmas and impose unexpected costs on potential adversaries.  The results of future wargames will be integrated into DoD’s new wargaming repository, which was recently established to help our planners and leaders better understand and shape how we use wargames while also allowing us to share the insights we gain across the defense enterprise. Driving Smart and Essential Technological Innovation The investments this budget makes in technology and innovation, and the bridges it helps build and rebuild, are critical to staying ahead of future threats in a changing world.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially DoD.  Today, not only is much more technology commercial, but the competition is global, with other countries trying to catch up with the advances we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber, and space.  So now, as we have in the past, DoD must invest to ensure America pioneers and dominates these and other technological frontiers. DoD is therefore pursuing new technology development along with new operational concepts, and new organizational constructs – all of which are reflected in or supported by this budget submission – to maintain our military’s technological superiority and ensure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.  How we do this is important, because while the Cold War arms race was characterized mostly by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, this era of technological competition is uniquely characterized by an additional variable of speed, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy; what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to upgrade them and repurpose them to be used in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats. In particular, this means leveraging the capability of current and emerging technologies, including commercial technologies wherever appropriate.  It means demonstrating and seeding investments in new capabilities and concepts to counter advanced anti-access, area-denial challenges across all domains and in every region where they persist – a particular focus of DoD’s effort to develop a third offset strategy.  And also, it means investing in and operationalizing our security by leveraging advances in cyber, space, electronic warfare, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other areas.  Our technologies and capabilities must be able to operate so that no matter what any of our enemies might throw at them, they are able to defeat attempts to be hacked. Accordingly, this budget invests a total of $183.9 billion in FY 2017, and $951 billion over the FYDP, to help research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and capabilities our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  For the second year in a row, the budget increases funding for our research and development accounts, which total $71.8 billion in FY 2017.  That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services, in our dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country, and in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing. At the same time that DoD is making investments in technologies themselves, we’re also investing in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s vibrant, innovative technology community and forging more connections with the commercial technology base – and it’s reflected in our budget.  In FY 2017, this includes $45 million for our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx), which we opened in Silicon Valley last August to build relationships and better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem.  It also includes $40 million for our pilot program with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel, leveraging its venture capital model to help find innovative solutions for some of our most challenging problems.  And it includes $137 million to support our public-private partnership-funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics that I announced in Silicon Valley last August.  In all these areas, similar to how DoD’s historic investments in things like GPS and the Internet later went on to yield great benefits for not just our security but also our society, we hope the investments we’re making in some of these fields along with our partners in the technology industry will lead to incredible advances that today we can only imagine. Importantly, technological innovation must be done in concert with operational innovation.  It’s not enough to have or create new technologies or weapon systems; how they are used is key.  The budget reflects work DoD has been undertaking in this area though multiple lines of effort.  First, there’s our Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program – an effort named after the mid-1970s project that brought together a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts who paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth – and also our Advanced Capability and Deterrence Panel.  Both focus on identifying and charting longer-term, leap-ahead investments for strategies and capabilities that will give us an advantage several decades from now, and together they make up nearly 60 percent of our science and technology investments in this budget submission. Now, to focus on maintaining our near-term advantage, DoD has an office that we don’t often talk about, but that I want to highlight today.  It’s called the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO).  I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense to reimagine existing DoD, intelligence community, and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  I picked a talented physicist to lead it.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but also has the rare virtue of rapid development and the even rarer charter to keep current capabilities viable for as long as possible.  So it’s good for both troops and taxpayers alike. SCO is focused on thinking differently, which is incredibly important to innovation when it comes to technological capabilities.  Thinking differently put us in space and on the moon.  It put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips.  It’s how we came to have airplanes that take off from the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, and satellite networks that take pictures of the world and show us where we are in it.  And this kind of bold, innovative thinking isn’t lost to history.  It’s happening every day, in SCO and many other places throughout the Department of Defense. Most people don’t often hear about it because most of its work is classified; however, SCO has been a tremendously useful part of DoD.  It’s received large support from all the services, as well as our combatant commands, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and also Congress – with its budget growing from $140 million in its first year, FY 2014, to reaching $845 million for FY 2017 in this year’s budget submission.  To show the return we’re getting on those investments, I’d like to highlight some projects SCO has been working on that we’re funding in the budget. First is a project focused on advanced navigation, where SCO is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads – enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand. Another SCO project uses swarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.  For the air, they’ve developed micro-drones that are really fast, and really resilient – they can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk.  Each one leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the micro-drones use a lot of commercial components and 3D printing.  And the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote for the Mars lander. SCO also has a project on gun-based missile defense, where we’re taking the same hypervelocity smart projectile developed for the electromagnetic railgun, and using it for point defense by firing it with artillery we already have in our inventory – including the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin a little over a month ago, and we found that it also significantly increases the range. There’s also a SCO project that we’re calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms, and turns it into a flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads.  In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes – essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities. The last SCO project I want to highlight is how we’re creating a brand new capability with the SM-6 missile, an interceptor that’s designed to launch from our Navy’s surface ships and be highly maneuverable and aerodynamic to stop incoming ballistic and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.  It’s one of our most modern and capable munitions – and thanks to work done by SCO, we’ve been able to modify the SM-6 so that in addition to missile defense, it can also target enemy ships at sea.  This new anti-ship mode makes the SM-6 doubly useful, taking the defensive speed and maneuverability already sitting in our Aegis destroyers’ launch cells and leveraging it for offensive surface warfare lethality.  That makes it a potent new capability for our fleet, and also a good deal for the taxpayer by using the same thing twice.  We already know this works; it was fully tested this past January to great success.  And, as I will address later in this testimony, this new operational concept is strongly reflected in our 2017 budget. Those are just a few projects that SCO has worked on so far – and they’re working on a lot more, including some surprising ones. Now, with all of that in mind – from why we need to invest in technological innovation, to how we’re doing it – let me address the specific investments this budget makes in technologies and capabilities to deter, and if necessary fight and win, a full-spectrum conventional war against even the most high-end of adversaries.  In concert, they will help maintain our military’s edge both under and on the sea, on land, in the air, in space, in cyber and electronic warfare, and in the modernization and maintenance of our nuclear enterprise. Maritime Investments In the maritime domain, the budget refocuses our Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts while continuing to grow the battle fleet to meet, but not exceed, the department’s warfighting posture requirement of 308 ships.  Our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years. First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – leveraging and growing our lead in an area where the U.S. military should be doing more, not less, going forward.  It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, including $170.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.5 billion over the FYDP for an improved heavyweight torpedo as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo to stay ahead of existing and emerging undersea challenges.  It includes $5.2 billion in FY 2017 and $29.4 billion over the FYDP to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; four of those submarines – up from three in last year’s budget – will be equipped with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that can more than triple each submarine’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles to 40.  The budget also invests $500 million in FY 2017, and $3.4 billion over the FYDP, to upgrade 49 of our submarines’ combat systems and enhance underwater acoustics on nine of our existing Virginia-class submarines.  It increases funding for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) by over $100 million in FY 2017, part of a total $173 million in FY 2017 and $1.2 billion over the FYDP that invests in, among other areas, rapid prototyping of UUVs in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – which is important, since UUVs can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  And it includes $2.2 billion in FY 2017 and $6.4 billion over the FYDP to continue procuring the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft.   Together, all these investments – totaling $8.2 billion in FY 2017, and $41.9 billion over the next five years – will ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world. Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary prevail in a full-spectrum conflict against even the most advanced adversaries.  It invests $597 million in FY 2017, and $2.9 billion over the FYDP, to maximize production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, procuring 125 in FY 2017 and 625 over the next five years – and this investment is doubly important given the SM-6’s new anti-ship capability.  It also invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads – including $1 billion in FY 2017, and $5.8 billion over the FYDP, for all variants of the SM-3 high-altitude ballistic missile interceptor; $340 million in FY 2017, and $925 million over the FYDP, for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile; $221 million in FY 2017, and $1.4 billion over the FYDP, for the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, including its extended range version; and $435 million in FY 2017, as part of $2.1 billion over the FYDP, for the most advanced variant of the Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which once upgraded can also be used for maritime strike. Third, the budget reflects decisions we’ve made to ensure that we look at our overall warfighting posture, rather than only the presence that contributes to it, in determining whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict.  Having grown the size and the capability of our surface and subsurface fleet over the last seven years, this budget will continue to do both.  It will ensure we meet the department’s 308-ship posture requirement – indeed, growing the battle fleet to 308 ships by the end of the FYDP – and it will make our naval forces as a whole more capable, more survivable, and more lethal than they would have been otherwise. The budget invests $3.4 billion in FY 2017 and $18.3 billion over the FYDP to continue to buy two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 over the FYDP – as well as $400 million in FY 2017 and $2.8 billion over the FYDP for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing $2.7 billion in FY 2017 and $13.5 billion over the FYDP for new construction of Ford-class carriers, as well as $2 billion in FY 2017 and $8.9 billion over the FYDP for midlife reactor refueling and overhauls on our current carrier fleet.  And, as I will discuss in the reform section of this testimony, it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers – providing them with more capability and a longer lifespan while freeing up significant funds that can be put toward a variety of uses. I’d like to now address the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), where we made an important tradeoff so we could put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and many other critical areas.  As such, the budget takes a new approach to the LCS and its associated frigate – buying a total of 40, not the 52 or more that were planned starting back in 2002.  Let me explain why.  First, to be clear, we’re investing in LCS and frigates because we need the capability they provide, and for missions like minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare, they’re expected to be very capable.  But now, in 2016, we have to further balance our shipbuilding investments among guided missile destroyers and Virginia-class attack submarines.  We face competitors who are challenging us on the open ocean with new submarines, ships, aircraft, and missiles – advanced capabilities we haven’t had to contend with in a long time, meaning that we must now invest more in higher-end capabilities across our own fleet.  The department’s warfighting analysis called for 40 small surface combatants, so that’s how many we’re buying.  Over the next 10 years, this will let us invest almost $8 billion more into highly lethal ships and capabilities – all the while increasing both the number of ships and the capability of our battle fleet.  While this will somewhat reduce the number of LCS available for presence operations, that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface, and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries.  Under this rebalanced plan, we will still achieve our 308-ship goal within the next five years, and we will be better positioned as a force to effectively deter, and if necessary defeat, even the most advanced potential adversaries. Land Investments To ensure our ground forces have the capabilities to counter emerging threats and the demonstrated ability to deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict, the budget will help provide our Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces with greater lethality in several forms.  This includes a next-generation shoulder-launched weapon, a life extension program as well as a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can be used for improved counter-battery and long-range strike, and increased firepower for Stryker armored fighting vehicles.  Together these investments comprise $780 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP. Additionally, the budget invests $735 million in FY 2017, and $6.8 billion over the FYDP, in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle intended to replace the military’s Humvees – procuring more than 2,000 vehicles in FY 2017, and a total of more than 17,700 vehicles over the next five years.  It also invests $159 million in FY 2017, and $1.7 billion over the FYDP, in the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which will replace the Marine Corps’ aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle – helping procure over 200 vehicles over the next five years.  And, as I discuss later in the reform section of this testimony, it supports the Army’s ongoing Aviation Restructure Initiative – investing $1.1 billion for 52 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.7 billion for 275 Apaches over the FYDP, as well as $1 billion for 36 UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.6 billion for 268 Black Hawks over the FYDP. The budget also invests $9.1 billion for missile defense in FY 2017, and $47.1 billion over the FYDP.  This reflects important decisions we’ve made to strengthen and improve our missile defense capabilities – particularly to counter the anti-access, area-denial challenge of increasingly precise and increasingly long-range ballistic and cruise missiles being fielded by several nations in multiple regions of the world.  Instead of spending more money on a smaller number of more traditional and expensive interceptors, we’re funding a wide range of defensive capabilities that can defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby impose higher costs on the attacker.  The budget invests in improvements that complicate enemy targeting, harden our bases, and leverage gun-based point defense capabilities – from upgrading the Land-Based Phalanx Weapons System, to developing hypervelocity smart projectiles that as I mentioned earlier can be fired not only from the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, but also the hundreds of Army M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  Additionally, the budget’s missile defense investments maintain DoD’s commitment to improving our homeland and theater defense systems – as we’re increasing the number of deployed Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) from 30 to 44, redesigning the exo-atmospheric kill vehicle to improve the reliability of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, and funding improvements and follow-on concept development for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Specifically, we're investing $1.2 billion in FY 2017 and $5.8 billion over the FYDP for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program; for THAAD, we're spending $640 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP, which includes procuring 24 interceptors in FY 2017 and 149 over the FYDP; and, to research, develop, and deploy a new Long-Range Discrimination Radar, we’re investing $317 million in FY 2017 and $1 billion over the FYDP. Air Investments To ensure the U.S. military’s continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in several areas – and not just platforms, but also payloads.  For example, it invests $2.4 billion in FY 2017 and $8 billion over the FYDP in a wide range of versatile munitions – including buying more Small Diameter Bombs, JDAMs, Hellfires, and AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.  We are also developing hypersonics that can fly over five times the speed of sound. The budget continues to buy the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.  It includes $10.1 billion in FY 2017 and $56.3 billion over the FYDP to procure a total of 404 F-35s across the force through 2021 – 43 F-35As for the Air Force in FY 2017 as part of 243 to be purchased over the FYDP, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 97 to be purchased over the FYDP, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 64 to be purchased over the FYDP.  This represents a slight deferral in Air Force F-35 procurement, which we’re doing in order to free up funds to maintain a larger-size Air Force of 55 tactical fighter squadrons, and to improve avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, and B-52 fleets – increasing their lethality, survivability, and therefore usefulness in a full-spectrum conflict.  At the same time, it also represents an increase in the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-35 procurement, which is important to ensure sufficient high-end capability and numbers in our aircraft carriers’ tactical fighter fleet. Additionally, the budget invests $1.4 billion in FY 2017 and $12.1 billion over the FYDP for continued development of the Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as $3.1 billion in FY 2017 and $15.7 billion over the FYDP to continue upgrading our aerial tanker fleet – buying 15 KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers in FY 2017 as part of 75 aircraft to be purchased over the FYDP. The budget also reflects important decisions regarding future unmanned aerial systems, such as the Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), formerly known as the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Air Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program – by focusing in the near-term on providing carrier-based aerial refueling, we’re setting the stage for a future unmanned carrier air wing.  With this approach, the Navy will be able to quickly and affordably field the kinds of unmanned systems that its carrier air wings need today, while laying an important foundation for future, more capable unmanned carrier-based platforms.  We know we need to ensure aircraft can operate off the carrier in high-threat environments, and we’re working hard to make them unmanned – it’s just that the UCLASS program as previously structured was not the fastest path to get us there.  This approach will allow us to get started integrating unmanned aircraft onto our aircraft carriers affordably and as soon as possible. Furthermore, to maximize the capabilities and extend the reach of all our airborne systems, the budget reflects how we’re expanding manned-unmanned teaming – from buying Navy MQ-4C Triton unmanned maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft, which can be paired with our P-8A Poseidon aircraft for a variety of missions; to buying Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that can pair with MQ-1C Gray Eagle scouts; to buying Air Force F-35s that can network with both payloads and platforms. Cyber and Electronic Warfare Investments This budget significantly increases our cyber capabilities, with new investments totaling over $900 million in FY 2017 compared to last year’s budget. Because defending our networks is and must be DoD’s number-one mission in cyberspace, the budget makes significant investments to improve our defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding.  These include $336 million over the FYDP to support more capable network perimeter defenses, as well as $378 million over the FYDP to train and strengthen DoD’s Cyber Protection Teams to respond to security breaches, grow our cyber training and testing ranges, and support tool development that will let our Cyber Mission Force quickly respond to cyberattacks against our networks regardless of where they are stationed around the world. Reflecting our renewed commitment to deterring even the most advanced adversaries, the budget also invests in cyber deterrence capabilities, including building potential military response options.  This effort is focused on our most active cyber aggressors, and is based around core principles of resiliency, denial, and response. As part of DoD’s second cyber mission – defending the nation – the budget invests in an advanced capability to disrupt cyberattacks of significant consequences.  And to support DoD’s third cyber mission – providing offensive cyber options that if directed can augment our other military systems – the budget invests $347 million over the FYDP to help provide cyber tools and support infrastructure for the Cyber Mission Force and U.S. Cyber Command. DoD has a unique level of resources and cyber expertise compared to the rest of the federal government, and following the recent data breaches of the Office of Personnel Management’s information technology systems, DoD has undertaken responsibility for the development, maintenance, and cybersecurity of the replacement background investigation systems and their data infrastructure.  To provide proper support and a dedicated funding stream for this effort, the President’s budget includes $95 million for DoD in FY 2017.  Also, on a separate but related note, the budget invests $454 million over the FYDP to ensure DoD will continue to have access to the trusted microelectronic components needed in our weapon systems.  By developing alternative sources for advanced microchips and trusted designs, this funding will help ensure the long-term security of our systems and capabilities. Meanwhile, to protect our platforms and ensure U.S. freedom of maneuver in contested environments, the budget also continues to support research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of advanced electronic warfare capabilities – totaling $3.7 billion in FY 2017 and $20.5 billion over the FYDP.  To enhance the electronic survivability and lethality of fighter and bomber aircraft like the F/A-18, F-15, and B-2, we’re investing in both offensive and defensive airborne capabilities, including the Air Force’s Defensive Management System modernization and Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, and also the Navy’s Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures and Next Generation Jammer.  We’re upgrading the radar on our E-3 Sentry AWACS with enhanced electronic protection to make adversary jammers less effective.  Investments in the Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program will help our ships protect themselves better.  And to help protect our ground forces, the budget invests in the Army’s Common Infrared Countermeasures and Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, as well as the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger pod. While cyber and electronic warfare capabilities provide, for the most part, different techniques to achieve similar mission objectives, an integrated approach can yield additional benefits.  This is reflected in our budget, including investments intended to ensure we can hold even the most challenging targets at risk. Space Investments As I mentioned earlier, this budget continues and builds upon important investments in last year’s budget to help secure U.S. access to space and address space as an operational domain. After adding over $5 billion in new investments in DoD’s 2016 budget submission to make us better postured for contested military operations in space – including over $2 billion in space control efforts to address potential threats to U.S. space systems – this budget largely sustains those investments over the FYDP.  While there is much more work ahead, we are on a good path in our efforts to complicate an adversary’s ability to defeat our systems while also enhancing our ability to identify, attribute, and negate all threatening actions in space. Meanwhile, the budget also supports strengthening our current space-based capabilities, and maturing our space command and control.  It invests in more satellites for our Space-Based Infrared System to maintain the robust strategic missile warning capability we have today.  And it allocates $108 million over the FYDP to implement the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), which will better align joint operations in space across the U.S. government. DoD must have assured access to space through multiple reliable sources that can launch our critical national security satellites, which is why the budget invests $1.8 billion for space launch in FY 2017 and $9.4 billion over the FYDP.  Because we want to end the use of the foreign RD-180 engine as soon as possible, and because we have a strong desire to preserve competition for space launch in order to ensure multiple launch service providers can sustain uninterrupted access to space, and to control costs, the budget includes funds for competitive public-private partnerships to help develop new launch services, which we believe is the most responsible way forward.  Merely developing a new engine would not give us the assured access to space that we require.  We plan to take advantage of the emerging commercial space launch marketplace using an innovative, more commercial approach – investing through competition in new launch services in return for priced options for future launches. Nuclear Enterprise Investments The budget also makes reforms and investments needed to continue providing a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.  Compared to last year’s budget submission, it adds $10 billion over the next five years, for a total of $19 billion in FY 2017 and $108 billion over the FYDP for maintaining, and modernizing the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control, and communications systems.  This reflects DoD’s continuing commitment to the nuclear triad and its critical mission. In addition to making an array of investments across the nuclear enterprise – from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance, to technological efforts that improve the sustainability of our bomber fleet – the budget also fully funds the first stages of our key nuclear modernization effort, in particular the replacement of our Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.  The Ohio Replacement Program is allocated $1.9 billion in FY 2017 and $13.2 billion over the FYDP, which in addition to research and development will allow the first year of construction on an incrementally-funded first ship to begin in FY 2021. We expect the total cost of nuclear modernization to be in the range of $350-$450 billion.  Although this still presents an enormous affordability challenge for DoD, we believe it must be funded.  Previous modernizations of America’s strategic deterrent and nuclear security enterprise were accomplished by topline increases to avoid having to make drastic reductions to conventional forces, and it would be prudent to do so again.  I hope DoD can work with Congress to minimize the risk to our national defense. Building the Force of the Future While we have the finest fighting force in the world today, that excellence is not a birthright, and we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again, starting with our most enduring advantage – our people. That’s what building the force of the future is all about:  making sure that long into the future, my successors will be able to count on the same excellence in people that I do today.  And we have several overarching priorities to help us do that, like attracting a new generation of talented Americans, promoting diversity, and rewarding merit; carving tunnels through the walls between DoD, the private sector, our reserve force, and other agencies across the government; and updating and modernizing our personnel management systems with technology and data analysis to help improve the choices and decisions we make related to our people. I made this commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school in Abington, Pennsylvania to outline my vision for the force of the future.  I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and labor market changes, we in the Pentagon must try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans.  In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, and Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century.  And this past December, I announced that we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force. Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  It’s not a business.  We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows our friends and family members and fellow citizens to go to school, go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give the next generation a better future. The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. Last spring I asked DoD’s Personnel and Readiness chief, Brad Carson, to lead a team in developing a package of bold proposals, which they did – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and also coming up with some new ideas.  Subsequently, a senior leadership team led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva has been working with the service vice chiefs to closely analyze each proposal and make recommendations before I decide.  While this process is still ongoing for some proposals, I’ve decided to announce my decisions on other proposals as I’ve made them, which I will now detail. The First Link to the Force of the Future I outlined the first link we’re building to the force of the future at George Washington University last November, announcing over a dozen new initiatives in several categories that are intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent. First, we’re creating what we call ‘on-ramps’ for people who aren’t involved with DoD but want to try contributing to our mission.  One way we’re doing this is by having better managed internship programs that more effectively transition promising interns into employees.  Another is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community for a time to help solve some of our most complex problems.  We’re also going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two.  And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles, as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Second, we’re creating short-term ‘off-ramps’ for those currently in DoD, so they can gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives from outside and then bring them back in to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking.  One way we’re doing this is by expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family.  DoD plans to seek authorities to make this program permanent, and looks forward to working with Congress to do so – similar to how we were able to partner last year to update and modernize retirement benefits and ensure that the 80 percent of our force that doesn’t serve 20 years will get the benefits they earned whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life. And third, we’re going to use 21st century data and technology to improve and modernize our talent management systems.  We’re launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help give servicemembers and units more choice in matching up for future assignments.  We’re creating an Office of People Analytics to leverage big data to inform our personnel policies.  We’re finally implementing exit surveys, so we can have quantitative data on why people decide to leave.  And to help us keep bringing in the best people, we’re looking at ways to evaluate recruit performance, improve outcomes, and better analyze trends that if left unchecked could indicate or lead to our military’s insularity from the rest of society. The Second Link to the Force of the Future Last month, I announced our so-called second link to the force of the future, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life.  They were developed keeping in mind DoD’s recruiting, retention, and career and talent management needs, as well as our closely-linked readiness and warfighting demands, which must always guide us. We know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force – 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages, with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other.  So while we recruit a servicemember, we retain a family.  This means that what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we’re a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit, is absolutely essential to our future strength.  While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known; among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top.  We also know that at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services.  And we know that a high level of work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service. To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work-life balance.  These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly four-in-five of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce – twice the rate of baby boomers.  These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly. That’s why, for starters, we’re providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force – setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, and working with Congress to seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  These changes put DoD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  For both mothers and fathers alike, this establishes the right balance between offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force.  While I don’t take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we’re providing across the joint force.  This will be an increasingly important factor as current and future generations of parents have different views and expectations in parenting, and we must continue to be able to attract and retain the best talent among them. Additionally, we’re expanding the child care we provide on our bases, because whether for single parents, for families where both parents work outside the home, or for every mother or father in our military, child care hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands.  So based on feedback from pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase child care access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with child care they can rely on – from before reveille to after taps – we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  And we show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals. We’re also making relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breastfeeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, we’re requiring the installation or modification of mothers’ rooms throughout all facilities when there are more than 50 women regularly assigned. Furthermore, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time, as is here as elsewhere, preserving our force's effectiveness.  Data indicates that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness. DoD will be seeking legislative authority to this effect – when the needs of the force permit a service member to stay at their current location, we will seek to empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation. Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  To better account for this in the benefits we provide our troops, DoD will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active duty service members – a benefit that will help provide men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers. Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries.  The initiatives approved to date total $867 million across the FYDP; we’ve included this in our budget because it’s a worthy investment that will yield great returns. More Still to Come While these first two links are important, we will have more to announce on the force of the future in the coming months.  For example, we’re taking a serious look at some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system, and I greatly appreciate Congressional leaders from both parties who have indicated their support for such reforms in principle.  We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions.  In both of these efforts, working with Congress will be essential to ensure that our force of the future is as strong as the force of today. Reforming the DoD Enterprise As I’ve said consistently from the moment I became Secretary of Defense, I cannot ask for more taxpayer dollars for defense without being candid about the fact that not every defense dollar is spent as wisely or responsibly as it could be, and also being determined to change that and make our department more accountable.  That’s why reforming the DoD enterprise is so important – from improving how we’re organized so we can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the future security environment, to continuing to improve our acquisition and enterprise-wide business and audit practices, to reducing excess infrastructure and overhead, to modernizing the military healthcare system. Before I address the reforms in this budget submission, it’s important to consider the recent history of defense reform – how DoD has been embarked on a reform path for much of the last seven years, and how we appreciate Congress’s work with us over the last year on acquisition and modernized retirement reforms. Despite what some may think, this administration hasn’t been dragging its feet when it comes to defense reform – the reality has been quite the opposite.  Beginning in 2009, we reduced the number of senior executives and general and flag officers, while working with Congress to trim management headquarters staffs by 20 percent, and move DoD toward auditability.  We’ve done three iterations of the Better Buying Power initiative I established to continuously improve our acquisitions, with Better Buying Power 3.0 incorporated into this budget, and we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time.  And we’ve continually submitted much-needed reforms to strengthen the efficiency and capability of our force – many of which have been continually denied, either in whole or in part, at a cost for both taxpayers and our troops.  This last part poses a real problem, because every dollar Congress denies us in reform is a dollar we can’t invest in security we need to deter and defend against today’s and tomorrow’s threats. Now is the time for action.  DoD will work closely with Congress on any anticipated reform legislation, and we welcome an open and collaborative process.  In the past, legislative reform has proven to be a double-edged sword – sometimes it leads to constructive change, which is good, but other times it just adds to bureaucracy and overhead, even if that was never the intent.  I hope that with the focus on reform we’ve recently been seeing in this and the other defense committees in Congress, we can work together to do reform right.  And we should, because there’s a lot that needs to be accomplished in many areas. Continuously Improving Acquisition DoD has been, and still is, absolutely committed to improving acquisition outcomes.  After five years of implementing our Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives for continuous process improvements in the defense acquisition system, we’re seeing compelling indications of significant improvement in acquisition outcomes – for example, annual growth metrics for contracted costs on our major programs have dropped dramatically from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2011 to a 30-year low of 3.5 percent in 2015, and a much higher percentage of major programs are projecting cost reductions relative to initial baselines than in the past.  While these developments are positive signs, we can and must do more to sustain and where possible accelerate our momentum to keep improving and deliver better military capability while protecting American taxpayers. We need to continue reducing overhead and bureaucracy associated with the acquisition system, making it more agile and having a faster flow of commercial technology into our weapon systems.  DoD is comfortable with the reforms in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act – which included several legislative reforms that DoD proposed last year – and we strongly support the increased role of the service chiefs in acquisition programs, particularly on cost and requirements trade-offs.  Going forward, it’s important that we take the responsible approach to absorb these reforms and see their effects before making additional major changes. DoD also appreciates Congress’s interest in flexibility and agility, because the pace of threat changes and technology development are not compatible with our long cycles of budget submission, authorization, and appropriations.  And DoD will be looking for opportunities to work with Congress to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our acquisition process.  In particular, we would welcome greater flexibility in appropriations or reprogramming to initiate development of urgently needed capabilities.  The flexibility to start a program as soon as a threat is identified would save critical time – as much as two years under current practices – and position both DoD and industry to more quickly initiate development, without a long-term commitment, outside the traditional budget cycle.  This step would represent a ‘free’ two years of lead time to acquiring a new capability. Spending Taxpayer Dollars More Efficiently The budget submission reflects several important efforts to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently, generating savings that would be much better invested in other areas like the fight against ISIL or deterring Russian aggression. Part of this means making more reductions to overhead, and also adopting some commonsense business practices that are long overdue – which in total we expect to help save nearly $8 billion over the next five years.  By better managing the 20 percent management headquarters reductions I mentioned earlier, including delayering and flattening management organizational structures, and also by increasing the reduction to 25 percent, we expect to save close to $5.9 billion over the FYDP.  And we’re modernizing how we manage our commissaries and military exchanges, to optimize their business practices and respond to the changing needs of their customers.  Unlike commissary and military exchange reforms proposed in previous budgets, this new approach protects the benefits they provide our people while still generating expected savings of nearly $2 billion over the FYDP. We’re also making real progress on reforming DoD’s myriad systems and business processes to meet our commitment to be audit ready by the beginning of FY 2018.  The three military departments began audits of their budgets for the first time last year, and DoD financial audits currently cover over 75 percent of our total General Fund budgetary resources and just over 90 percent of the current year dollars. In addition, we need to stop spending so much money to hold onto bases we don’t need, and implement a domestic round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2019 as we’re requesting.  While it’s helpful that the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act allowed a study of DoD’s excess infrastructure, the bottom line is that we have more bases in more places than we need, with preliminary analysis indicating that we have over 20 percent excess infrastructure.  To ignore this fact while criticizing DoD for wasteful spending is not only a sin of omission, but a disservice to America’s taxpayers.  Last year’s Congressional denial forced the BRAC round to slip from 2017 to 2019, further prolonging our ability to harvest savings we greatly need.  By then it will have been 14 years since DoD was allowed to right-size its domestic infrastructure, which any business leader or citizen would think is ridiculous – and they’d be right.  Now is the time to fix it. Reexamining Goldwater-Nichols and Defense Institutional Reform I appreciate that Congress shares my desire to make institutional reform a priority.  To help formulate DoD’s recommendations to Congress on reviewing Goldwater-Nichols reforms, I asked our Deputy Chief Management Officer last fall to lead a comprehensive review of organizational issues in DoD – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and the military departments – and search for potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of improvement. This review is currently ongoing, and preliminary internal findings are expected in March to help shape our forthcoming recommendations to Congress.  Without prejudging any outcomes, I can say our review is looking at things like increasing coordination and eliminating unnecessary overlap between OSD and the Joint Staff, and between the service secretariats and staffs; better aligning combatant command staffs to their mission; streamlining acquisition requirements and decision-making processes; having more flexibility in the laws and policies that govern joint duty qualifications; and better aligning the Joint Staff and the combatant commands to produce operational advice and respond to transregional threats. That said, there are some early results I can preview already – for example, we will likely not recommend going so far as to create a General Staff or include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the chain of command.  But we will likely develop an improved capability for the Joint Staff in strategy development, including reviewing operational plans and identifying military alternatives to address contingencies, subject to political guidance from civilian leadership.  And, using my authority as Secretary of Defense, we will likely provide the Chairman greater responsibility for global integration, including increased authority to synchronize, organize, and prioritize military activities and resources across combatant command boundaries. I look forward to the full results of our review, and I hope you will too.  While DoD’s current organization produces sound military advice and operational decisions, it often does so in a needlessly costly and time-consuming manner – leaving plenty of room for organizational improvements that can make us more agile and efficient.  While much is within our authority to do, we look forward to working with Congressional committees to implement it. Modernizing and Simplifying the Military Healthcare System DoD greatly appreciates that Congressional leaders have said 2016 will be the year to reform our military healthcare system, TRICARE, after having passed retirement modernization reform in 2015.  As you know, DoD has proposed various ways to reform TRICARE for several years, so we look forward to working very closely with Congress in the year ahead.  The reforms reflected in the budget give beneficiaries more simplicity and choice in how they manage their healthcare, while also incentivizing the much more affordable use of military treatment facilities.  This will not only save money, but also maximize the workload and readiness of our military’s medical force, giving our doctors, nurses, medics, and corpsmen the experience they need to be effective at their mission.  Together this should generate about $548 million in FY 2017 and almost $7 billion over the FYDP that can be better spent in other ways without sacrificing the care of our people.  It’s time to get this done. Making Sure Retirement Reform Works DoD greatly appreciates being able to work closely with Congress last year in reforming the military’s retirement system.  In this year’s budget submission, we are including a few modifications to military retirement reform to help make sure those reforms work in the best possible way for the future strength and success of our military. First, continuation pay should not be an entitlement at 12 years of service, but rather a vitally important force shaping tool.  DoD should have the flexibility to determine if and when to offer this benefit so we can better retain the talent we need the most at any given time. Second, the blended retirement plan that Congress passed last year needs some modifications to avoid having adverse effects on retention – in particular, slightly raising the maximum matching contribution from 4 percent to 5 percent.  To improve retention, we also propose increasing the number of years a servicemember has to serve before matching contributions begin – so instead of beginning them at the start of their third year of service, it would be at the start of their fifth year of service, after their first reenlistment.  DoD looks forward to working with Congress to make these proposals a reality. The Right Force Structure for Current and Future Operations The budget also reflects critical decisions on force structure reforms, all of which are vital to making sure our troops have the capabilities they need for both present and future missions.  While Congress has too often rejected such reforms out of hand, our decisions this year show that when world events and operational demands require the Defense Department to change its plans, it does so.  In turn, Congress must do the same, and recognize that with a set budget and the need to invest in advanced capabilities to strengthen high-end deterrence, it’s time to seriously consider these reforms and stop tying our hands from implementing them. I mentioned earlier that we’re pushing off the A-10’s final retirement until 2022 so we can keep more aircraft that can drop smart bombs on ISIL; in addition to changing when A-10s will be retired, we’re also changing how it will happen.  As 2022 approaches, A-10s will be replaced by F-35s only on a squadron-by-squadron basis as they come online, ensuring that all units have sufficient backfill and that we retain enough aircraft needed to fight today’s conflicts. While some members of Congress may think the Navy’s phased approach for modernizing its guided missile cruisers is just a ploy to quickly retire them, that is incorrect – in fact, retiring them now or anytime soon would be a serious mistake.  Our cruisers are the best ships we have for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and given the anti-ship missiles being developed by other nations, we not only can’t afford to go without them; we also need them to be as modern and capable as possible, and for them to stay in service as long as they can.  The Navy’s plan is still smarter and more affordable than the approach laid out by Congress, saving us $3 billion over the FYDP that we’re putting to good use elsewhere in the budget.  And to make clear that this is not a ploy to quickly retire our cruisers, we will be submitting proposed legislative language that Congress can pass to hold the department to its word. Additionally, the Army is continuing to implement its Aviation Restructure Initiative in accordance with the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act as the Chief of Staff of the Army reviews the recent findings of the National Commission on the Future of the Army.  While we will revisit the Army’s aviation transfer plan when we receive the Chief of Staff of the Army’s report, the Commission’s proposal to keep four Apache battalions in the Army National Guard could cost over $2.4 billion if the Army fully equips all 20 active battalions and keeps all aircraft currently dedicated to its equipment set in South Korea.  By improving the readiness of the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and better leveraging the diverse capabilities Black Hawk helicopters bring to the table for National Guard missions both here at home and around the world when called upon as an operational reserve, the Army’s planned Aviation Restructure Initiative is in the best interests of both the Army as well as the taxpayers who support it. The Opportunity of Reform Regardless of how any of our proposed reforms might be initially received, DoD needs Congress to work together with us on a path forward for all of them, because there’s a real opportunity in front of us. With last fall’s budget deal, you showed that cooperation and prudent compromise for the good of our future security and strength was actually possible.  And our reform submissions on things like the A-10, commissaries, and TRICARE reflect the fact we’ve heard Congress’s concerns about past submissions, and made adjustments accordingly. If we don’t lead the way ahead together, both troops and taxpayers alike will be forced to deal with the consequences.  So let’s work together on their behalf.  VI. REQUESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE: THE IMPERATIVE OF WORKING TOGETHER Before concluding, I want to reemphasize the big picture, because this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, and we need your support for it. For a long time, DoD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon – at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts – long-term at the expense of the here-and-now.  Thankfully we were able to realize that over the last decade, correct it, and with help from Congress turn our attention to the fights we were in. The difference today is that, while such a singular focus made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won’t work for the world we live in.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges – not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both, and we have to have a budget that supports both.  That means funding a force with the right size, readiness, and capabilities to prevail in today’s conflicts while simultaneously building a force that can prevail in the future – recognizing that future force won’t exist unless we take actions today.  That’s what this budget submission was designed to do, and we need your help to do it. I thank this committee again for overwhelmingly supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget; our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, and we hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest risk we face in DoD is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically in the Congress is averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time. By working together, I am confident we can succeed, because in many ways we already have.  If we think back to those defense investments and decisions that changed the course of our nation’s and our military’s history for the better – and not just in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like the all-volunteer force – they were all able to benefit our security and our society because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations. That same support for what’s in this budget is essential today to address the security challenges we face and seize the opportunities within our grasp.  We need your support in the decisions that our senior military leaders and I are advocating for.  We need you to work with us, and not tie our hands, when it comes to pursuing smart and critical reforms.  And we need you to provide adequate, stable, predictable resources, as only you can, by coming together as you have before – including, in the coming years, to avert the return of sequestration once again.  As long as you do, I know our national security and national strength will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come.

"Oct. 15, 2014","Gordon, thank you very much. And I want to thank you also for your continued contributions to the security of this country, to our country, and for your continued distinguished leadership of this important organization. And to all the members of AUSA, thank you for what you continue to do to support our men and women and support our national security enterprise. Your strong leadership, Gordon, over many, many years, has been valued by my predecessors.  That wise counsel and leadership has been valued by me, not only in this job but as a United States Senator, and I appreciate that personally. So thank you. I also want to this afternoon recognize this year’s AUSA medal and award recipients. You all know that you represent the finest group of people that we build and produce in the United States of America. You all exemplify the values and principles of the exceptional individuals whose names these awards and medals are given: people like my late friend John Dixon, whose award this year is being given to retired Lieutenant General David Melcher. This award is being given to General Melcher for his continued contributions to national defense from the industrial community. And to you, General Melcher, congratulations, Mrs. Melcher, nice to see you. Every day, I have the privilege of working alongside some of the finest soldiers in the United States Army, some of the soldiers that every day protect our country, some of the finest soldiers our Army has ever produced – from Staff Sergeant April Jones, who works in my front office, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marty Dempsey.  And in particular, I want to thank Marty Dempsey. I greatly admire and value his wise counsel, his leadership, our partnership. I consider General Dempsey a partner in this effort, and I consider him a friend. I want to also acknowledge and thank the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, and General Odierno, Chief of Staff of the United States Army. I recognize these two men and thank them for their – not only their leadership, but their friendship and their counsel and their directness and honesty as we evaluate the reality of our times, our threats, our challenges, and how do we build a United States Army that’s prepared for the future. Well, thank you. I also want to recognize another soldier I have appreciated working with: my Senior Military Assistant, who many of you know, Lieutenant General Abe Abrams. Abe is a real soldier, as you all know, but he’s also not only a warrior, but a thinker. And I couldn’t do the job that I do without Abe and without his assistance. The United States Army helped define me. And I’ve always been very proud of my service as a soldier. It allowed me to witness courage and nobility that I would never have had the opportunity to see if I had not been a soldier in the United States Army. It affected me, and I know it helped me, and maybe even made me a better person. I know my brother Tom, who served with me in Vietnam, feels the same about his service in the United States Army. So, I deeply appreciate, General Sullivan, the privilege to address not only the strongest advocates for America’s Army, but also our 1 million-plus Active-Duty, Guard, and Reserve soldiers. To understand the place of honor they hold across our military, one need only look to the words of Navy SEAL and recently retired Admiral Bill McRaven, who earlier this year said, “There is no more noble calling in the world than to be a soldier in the United States Army.” Together, we are at a time of great transition for the Army, and the nation it serves. In December, as we responsibly end our combat role in Afghanistan and transition to a train-advise-and-assist mission, the Afghan National Security Forces will be fully responsible for their country’s security – an accomplishment made possible by the tremendous sacrifices of American troops, our ISAF partners, and the Afghan people. As the Army emerges from over 13 years of large-scale combat operations – the longest in its history – it faces new challenges. The world is becoming more volatile, less predictable, and in many ways, more threatening… at the same time, our defense budgets are declining. The theme that you’ve chosen for this year – “Trusted Professionals: Today and Tomorrow” – is well-suited to describe the kind of soldiers America will need as we navigate this period of change and uncertainty. Before I address where the Army is and where it’s going, we should remind ourselves – and the American people – of where the Army is coming from. Over the past 13 years, more than 1 million soldiers deployed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One out of six of these soldiers was deployed to both countries. More than half a million soldiers – 30 percent of them Guardsmen and Reservists – endured multiple deployments… and as ground forces, they shouldered a very heavy burden. They fought in the mud, in the sand, in the streets – doing most of the fighting and dying, and adapting under fire to a kind of conflict far different from what the Army trained and prepared for during and after the Cold War. Seventy percent of U.S. personnel wounded in action over the last 13 years were from the U.S. Army, and countless soldiers have come home with visible – and invisible – wounds of war. Our enduring obligation to take care of them, and their families, is a sacred responsibility that we must always uphold. Through the crucible of combat and a grinding counterinsurgency campaign, the American soldier fought on, and as a result, today’s Army is as battle-tested as it’s ever has been. Of all the soldiers who served in Iraq since 2003, nearly half are still on active-duty or in the Guard and Reserves. Of those who served in Afghanistan, almost two-thirds are still in the Army. The strength, the resilience, and dedication of these soldiers are what the Army is about, what make the Army a foundation of America’s national security and our military’s global presence and engagement. And the Army’s contributions to our security are as critical today as ever. We see it in West Africa, where soldiers from Fort Campbell and Fort Bragg will soon deploy as a key part of America’s contribution to the global effort to stop the spread of Ebola before it becomes an even more of a grave threat. We see it in Poland and the Baltics, where soldiers from Fort Hood’s First Cavalry Division are reinforcing and reassuring our NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression. We see it in Iraq, where soldiers from the Big Red One, 1st Infantry Division, are deploying to train, advise, and assist Kurdish and Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIL. And we’ll soon see it in Saudi Arabia, where soldiers will help train and equip members of the moderate Syrian opposition. The President has been very clear that he will not commit our Armed Forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq, or become involved in a war in Syria. This is not because we think that wars cannot be waged without committing troops to combat. Our strategy in Iraq and Syria does require forces on the ground, but they must be local forces. And we will help them; we will support them; we will train them. This is not only the best way to degrade and ultimately defeat terrorists, but it is the only sustainable path to defeating terrorism and extremism. This is a critical point that Chairman Dempsey and the chiefs of defense from 21 other nations discussed yesterday at Andrews Air Force Base, at an important conference that helped reinforce our coalition against ISIL. In the near term, the Army is unlikely to repeat another Iraq- or Afghanistan-type campaign – that is, regime change and occupation followed by nation-building under fire. However, this does not mean that demand for the Army is diminishing, or that the Army’s place in our national security strategy is eroding. It is not. While there are no longer 150,000 soldiers in ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as there were five years ago, there are still almost as many soldiers either deployed or forward-stationed in nearly 150 locations around the world. That includes some 80,000 soldiers in the Pacific Command area of responsibility, more than any other, with nearly 20,000 soldiers in South Korea standing ready to “fight tonight.” There are also 40,000 soldiers under Central Command; 28,000 soldiers in Europe; and thousands more in both Africa and South America, some of whom I visited in Colombia last week. Demands on the Army will only grow more diverse and complicated going forward. Threats from terrorists and insurgents will remain with us for a long time. But we also must deal with a revisionist Russia – with its modern and capable army – on NATO’s doorstep. And as disruptive technologies and destructive weapons proliferate in the hands of state and non-state actors, the specter of so-called “hybrid warfare” looms large – where our adversaries marry the tactics of insurgents with the tools of advanced armed forces and their sophisticated technologies. The Army will remain essential to helping deter and confront every national security threat facing our country. There will always be a need for a modern, ready, well-equipped, well-trained standing army. But maintaining a ready and capable Army as we come out of 13 years of continuous large-scale combat will not be easy. For the Army to fulfill its role as a guarantor of our national security, our soldiers must continue to be exceptionally well-led, well-trained and well-equipped. That’s especially true because the global security environment is more unpredictable than ever, with crises erupting at any time… crises that require America to lead the world in response. We must not forget the lessons of history. We’ve seen how quickly a battle-hardened Army can wither into a force that is ill-equipped and ill-prepared to carry out its mission. And we’ve seen the consequences. In July, 1950, five years after America’s military victory in World War II, the soldiers of Task Force Smith were sent into the first battle of the Korean War, with orders to halt the North Korean advance. They were under-trained, under-equipped, outnumbered, and unprepared… and within hours of engaging the enemy, Task Force Smith was routed, ultimately suffering a casualty rate of nearly 30 percent. Soldiers paid for poor training, poor equipment, and poor leadership with their lives. We’ve also seen how past drawdowns sought to protect the training and equipment that is the essence of military readiness. Under General Sullivan, the Army Chief of Staff of the early 1990s, after Desert Storm and the end of the Cold War, the Army made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce the size of the force in order to safeguard readiness, with ‘No More Task Force Smiths’ as its mantra. As General Sullivan said at the time, quote, “The reason we cut … divisions was to keep what we retained trained and ready.” Today, ‘No More Task Force Smiths’ must once again be our motto. We need to maintain an exceptionally ready Army. But because of the steep, deep and abrupt defense budget cuts sequestration has imposed on us, last year the Army had to cancel so many critical training rotations that we had only two active-duty brigade combat teams who were fully ready and available to execute a major combat operation. Thanks to the budget compromise that the President and Congress reached last December, and the Army’s relentless focus on training, Army readiness has improved [from] where it was a year ago, with 12 out of 37 brigade combat teams that are trained to the highest levels of readiness. While this is a direct result of the Army’s ability to adapt to unreasonable budget constraints, it falls short of what I believe is sufficient to defend our nation and our allies with minimum risk. We must continue to put readiness first in the current budget environment – which is why we have modestly reduced the size of the Army and protected training and maintenance in our budget. Trading readiness for capacity is the path to a hollow force. Our soldiers deserve better than that. They deserve a stable and predictable budget that gives them and their families the training and support they need. But despite temporary relief, sequestration remains the law of the land. If Congress does not act, it will return in 2016 – stunting and reversing the Army’s readiness just as we’ve have begun to recover, and requiring even more dramatic reductions in force structure. The military as a whole will face a similar readiness crisis if Congress does not accept the program cuts and compensation reforms we have proposed in our budgets. Across DoD, we could face a $70 billion gap in our budget over the next five years if Congress prevents us from moving forward with these changes, and we would have little choice but to make up the differences through cuts to readiness. DoD’s leaders understand there will be less resources available. But the Army – and our military – needs Congress to be a partner in responsible, long-term planning and budgeting. And we will continue to urge Congress to put an end to sequestration – an irresponsible deferral of responsibility. I greatly appreciate General Sullivan’s and AUSA’s support for ending sequestration, and also for your support on many of our hard but necessary trade-offs made to protect readiness in DoD’s budget proposal. We must all continue to press Congress to join us in making these tough decisions – because our challenges will become far more difficult and far more dangerous the longer we defer the tough choices. Army leadership has expressed their concerns about this cloud of uncertainty. I’ve been very clear – Chairman Dempsey has been very clear – we’ve been clear with the Congress, with our troops, with their families, and with the American people – that I share a number of these concerns of the Army’s leadership. But as we work through our current budget challenges, the Army must still face the new reality of shrinking resources, sustained demands, and a more competitive and unpredictable strategic environment… an environment that our current defense strategy remains capable of addressing. The Army – and our entire military – will need to continue thinking critically about its future role in missions to ensure that it is not only ready, but relevant, for both the short and the long-term missions. It will need to continue to learn, adapt, evolve, and innovate. Readiness demands agility. I want to commend Secretary McHugh and General Odierno for taking the critical first steps in this direction, setting the course for the Army’s “Force 2025 and Beyond” [strategy] and shaping the new Army Operating Concept unveiled over the past week here at AUSA. I will continue to work closely with both of them, and all of our Army leaders, to build an Army the nation needs, the Army the nation deserves, and the Army that our troops need for their future. To succeed, I believe the Army must renew its commitment to readiness across three critical resources – its people, its capabilities, and its partnerships. First, the Army must keep a laser focus on the readiness of its most precious resource: its people. Because soldiers, to quote General Creighton Abrams, “are not in the Army. They are the Army.” Our soldiers need to be well-trained at all levels – from the individual to the brigade – and they must be prepared to face challenges from across the spectrum of conflict. The continuities of warfare remind us that even as we prepare against high-end threat, like cyber and precision missiles, the human dimension of war is inescapable. So we cannot forget what we’ve learned about counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and building partner capacity. We must retain those skills. At the same time, our soldiers must also be ready for full-spectrum operations. That takes time. It takes resources. To be ready for the range of challenges we’ll, most likely face in the future, soldiers need to experience nonlinear, full-spectrum training that mimics today’s complex operational environments. This kind of ‘decisive action’ training  is best conducted at the Army’s Combat Training Centers – the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, which I will visit next mouth. At these brigade-level training centers, soldiers are immersed in realistic threat scenarios where they face a dynamic mix of guerrilla, terrorist, criminal, and near-peer conventional opposing forces. In addition to preparing soldiers for full-spectrum operations, decisive-action training helps develop the kind of agile, adaptive, and innovative leaders that the Army needs to be ready for future threats. Many Army leaders already recognize that in a volatile world with a wide range of missions, we can no longer get by with training soldiers what to think. We must train them how to think, so they thrive in conditions of uncertainty and chaos, and are unpredictable to our adversaries. Going forward, whether we can keep our soldiers ready in the future will depend on Congress’s partnership in providing the resources to fund the training our soldiers need. Second, the Army must be ready with the right capabilities, both today and in the future – ensuring the equipment our soldiers currently have is well-maintained and that we continue to innovate going forward. More than any other service, the Army is well suited to this task. Because the Army knows its key weapons platforms for everything still comes down to the soldier, it also knows that a capability is about more than just new technology or equipment – with less money, it’s also about how we creatively use our technology and equipment to achieve our objectives. The Army has begun adapting capabilities to be ready for the most likely missions of the future – ensuring that prepositioned equipment stocks can support a wider range of operations, and even flying Apache helicopters off Navy ships to gauge how Army aviation could contribute to littoral surface warfare. The Army is also combining manned and unmanned capabilities – enabling combat helicopter pilots to monitor feeds and operate weapons from linked aerial drones, and testing driverless resupply convoys that can free up manpower for more important tasks. To stay ready for future challenges, the Army must keep innovating for the long term. With our ongoing rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, the Army could broaden its role by leveraging its current suite of long-range precision-guided missiles, rockets, artillery, and air defense systems. These capabilities would provide multiple benefits… such as hardening the defenses of U.S. installations; enabling greater mobility of Navy Aegis destroyers and other joint force assets; and helping ensure the free flow of commerce. This concept is worthy of consideration going forward. Such a mission is not as foreign to the Army as it might seem. After the War of 1812, the Army was tasked with America’s coastal defense for more than 100 years. Finally, one thing we’ve learned over the past 13 years is that the Army is effective at more than combined arms maneuver and wide-area security. It’s also exceptionally effective in training and exercising with friends and allies, helping them grow stronger while improving interoperability for the future. Building partner capacity is one of the Army’s most valuable capabilities, which is why the Army must continue taking steps to expand and diversify its partnerships – while ensuring that this critical mission continues to be embraced throughout the Army’s institutions. Though we must also be clear-eyed about our missions. Building partner capacity cannot happen in a vacuum. As we’ve seen in Iraq this year, political context is critical, as is ethos, esprit de corps and, especially, leadership. Today, the Army is better positioned to work with partners because of its regionally aligned forces. Nearly every unit – from division headquarters to theater enablers to combat brigades – is now aligned with a geographic region, which makes it easier for the Army to provide tailored, responsive forces to engage with our allies and our partners. And because soldiers receive specialized cultural, regional, and language training before deploying, they can better understand local underlying social, political, economic, historical factors that all are involved in security – ultimately making them more effective in accomplishing the mission. Shaping the security environment has now become a core competency for the Army – so rather than return to garrison, our soldiers must remain prepared to engage around the world. Those stationed here at home must be trained and ready to respond to a full range of contingencies… whether a mission includes building partner capacity, reassuring and reinforcing allies, or providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Across all these efforts – people, capabilities and partnerships – keeping the Army ready for today’s and tomorrow’s challenges will not be easy. The future security environment remains uncertain, and trying to predict it will continue to be as challenging as ever. Six months [before] Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, President Woodrow Wilson spoke to Congress, and he predicted “a growing cordiality … among … nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and goodwill. He spoke those words 101 years ago. We all know that history proved the president wrong. The so-called “War to End All Wars” was anything but a war to end all wars. A century later, we cannot know for sure what conflicts, challenges, or threats the next 100 years may bring, or the next 10 years may bring. We cannot say for certain whether history will be repeated or made anew. But we must prepare our institutions for the unexpected and the uncertain. That is the greatest responsibility of leadership. We know there are risks. We know we will make mistakes. But the American people depend upon an Army to be prepared. They trust that Army to be prepared. They expect and know the Army will be prepared. And I know – everyone here knows, those who represent today’s Army in this room know – that we will not fail them. Gordon Sullivan, to you and AUSA and everyone in this room, thank you for your support of this country and your continued leadership, and allowing me an opportunity to give you some of my thoughts and to recognize you for what you do. Thank you. ",Association of the United States Army (AUSA),https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/605618/association-of-the-united-states-army-ausa/
"July 4, 2015","As we celebrate Independence Day, I want to thank the men and women who serve our nation at home and abroad for all that you do to help keep America safe. When George Washington issued one of his first general orders on July 4, 1775, he transformed a loose group of colonial militias into a single force united in a common cause.  They built a legacy that lives on today, through generations of patriots like you, who have defended the ideals enshrined in our founding documents: the belief that we are all created equal and endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It’s the risks you take, and the sacrifices you make, that ensure those ideals endure for all of us. This Independence Day, you, including the nearly 200,000 troops currently serving overseas and unable to spend this holiday with their loved ones, continue to protect our country and ensure a more peaceful and prosperous world for our children.  In Europe and the Middle East, across the Asia-Pacific and in Africa, in cyber-space and at home, you prove that wherever our troops go, our highest ideals – the ones Washington and his troops fought for – go with them. As Americans celebrate at home and around the world, my thoughts are with you and with your families. May God bless you, and may God bless the great nation we defend.  Happy Independence Day.

"May 11, 2016"," Thanks, Mark. And, to the panelists, I heard the first two-thirds of that, or so, and just wanted to commend you all the ways you're thinking about the future, the ways that we're trying to think about the future as well including the FireEye question. Maybe I'll come back to that one a little bit later. Very much concerned about vulnerability in the long haul.  I second Penny's thought, of just a moment ago, and Jim, you started with it, but that relationship, that's the theme of today's meeting, in essence. The earlier, and more out in front of things we all get, the better we have. It may not be 100 proof, probability of 1, but we have a much higher probability of solving problems if we start early and do it together.  I'm all in. We're trying to do that in my own world, but it's a bigger world, and Penny, I fit in.  Mark, thanks. Mark's an old friend and colleague. I'm pleased that the nation's benefits from him, that the President benefits from him taking this job.  This is my fourth visit to Silicon Valley as Secretary of Defense. I only note that because when I became Secretary of Defense I learned that no Secretary of Defense had been here in 20 years. So, I've been here four times this year. I think that's appropriate, and my purpose is exactly the purpose for which NSTAC was created -- more about that in a moment, which is to build and rebuild the bridges between our national security endeavor. In my case, in the Pentagon.  My friends and colleagues here, the country's real lucky to have these two, by the way, doing what they're doing. I say that not only as a friend, but just the sheer competence there.  For me, it's the Pentagon, and bridges between that that our national security mission, and the wonderful, open immensely creative innovative technology community, which is one of our other -- our countries other great strengths. It's been bringing those two great strengths together, which has protected us and helped us make a better world.  This is an interesting body for me to address, and I'll tell you the reason. I worked for Casper Weinberger way back, early in my career on nuclear command and control. Some issues at that time. That happened, my time, doing that happened to coincide with the issue of the break-up of the Bell system, for those of you who can remember that. I certainly remember it.  One system, Universal Service. It was Caps view that this was a risk to the national command and control system which was carried on the backs, in those days, of the public switch network. There were just a very few common carriers, they were all heavily regulated, and things like putting classified switches in a Faraday Cage, and grounding ductwork that carried cables and so-forth was paid off the rate base, and that was an important subsidy to national security.  With the breakup of the Bell system, that issue became urgent, and when the dust settled -- and there was dust then too in the air, but the dust was settled through dialogue, through working together. Solutions were worked out, and NSTAC was the mechanism for doing that.  If I remember it -- I remember it very vividly, and I'm glad. Now, it's moved on.  It's moved on technologically, and you do a lot more than the public switch circuit switched voice telephony system of those days. But, it was President Reagan, actually, at the time that brought these two communities together to solve a problem that was urgent at the time. I just thought I'd note that because that was three decades ago, but it signifies the importance of this kind of mechanism, and as the world changed -- as I indicated, NSTAC has changed too to its great credit.  It moved from DOD to the Department of Homeland Security. It moved from voice telephony to the Internet, and everything else that goes on it, and with it. And, I think it has more of a focus now on emerging technology, and the future, and being anticipatory. It was a little more reactive at that time. All of those good, all of those good, appropriate migrations.  I wanted to talk a little bit about our approaches in the Department of Defense to innovation generally. And, the private-public cooperation as an instance of that, but we're trying to do a lot more than that even as the companies you invest in, and the world represented by the companies here try to do a lot of things all at the same time.  When I began my career in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and it originated in one way or another in close connection to the government, frequently the national security community. We're still a big sponsor in DOD, but the technology base is much more commercial, much more global now than it was then. We need to take that into account in how we can port ourselves as the national security community.  We also have a very different security world than we had then. We were really focused on one thing primarily, today we have -- the way I say it is, five major immediate and evolving challenges that our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are involved with every day. They're working with a global coalition each and every day with more, and more ingenuity, and more, and more power every day to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will do. We will surely do, but we want to do that as soon as possible.  They're training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression. They're sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific ensuring that the most consequential reason for America's future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations. They're standing guard on the Korean peninsula day and night, every day, every night. And, countering Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East. All the while they're helping protect the homeland.  In the Department of Defense, we don't have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges, or between acting in the present, or investing in the future. We have to do it all. To stay ahead of those challenges, to stay the best, I have been pushing those in the Pentagon to think, as I say, outside of our five-sided box. Invest aggressively in innovation, innovative people, innovative technologies, and innovative practices, and I want to tell you some of the things that we're doing so that you'll know but you can help us, and give us yet more ideas.  We start with the people because they, more than anything else, are the reason why our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Our people. and, that's why it's so important to do what I call building the force of the future to ensure that amidst changes in generations, in technology, and in labor markets, we're always postured to recruit, develop and retain the best young men and women that America has to offer for what it, after all, an all-volunteer force.  Part of that, we're creating various -- I call them on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow between the DOD and the tech sector in both directions. That way more of America's brightest minds can contribute to our mission, and our outstanding military and civilian leaders, and technologists across the DOD, and the innovative defense industry that supports us already, we'll be able to interact in new ways with our countries hubs of innovation.  Take, for example, our new defense, Digital Service, which brings in technologists from larger companies like Amazon, startups like Shopify, for a tour of duty, as we call it. These are really talented people, and we've got a bunch of them now, who come into DOD just to just a year or two. Sometimes just a project, but make a lasting contribution to us, and our mission, one they'll never forget. They can tell their kids about it when they have kids. And, also experience being part of something bigger than themselves. That's just one example.  We have a career intermission program which lets people take a sabbatical from military service while they're getting a degree, or learning a new skill. We're bringing in entrepreneurs and residents to work with senior leaders like me on challenging problems for, again, a short time.  We're going to hire a Chief Recruiting Officer to bring in top for stints in civilian leadership roles, not unlike HP co-founder, David Packard, who served as Deputy Secretary of Defense and was one of the first people I was associated with in this business of defense.  One area that's particularly important here is our cyber mission force. These are of necessity very talented people. Some active duty, but also reservists and guardsmen who hunt down intruders in our networks, perform the forensic that help keep our system secure and combat our adversaries in the cyber domain. We need to be able to bring in the best talent we can and that's why we're using these folks who in many cases serve us on the weekends, and during the week are network defenders in some of our leading companies. How else are we going to have access to that kind of talent, except through the reserve and guards? It's an amazing opportunity for us.  We also have an accept service civilian personnel system that is going to allow us to augment these forces. That way if security, cyber security experts in the private sector, or even elsewhere in DOD want to come to work at Cyber Command, the hiring process will be more competitive with the private sector, and we'll have a lot less red tape. That's going to be necessary to have some good people.  In addition to people, which is critical, but we're also investing in technology itself. All the ones the three of you named, were involved in every single one of them, pushing the envelope as much as we can.  The budget I've Been defending before Congress for the last few weeks, we're proposing spending nearly $72 billion dollars next year on research and development. For context, that's more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google combined spent last year. So, it's a lot of money.  Among other things, that money funds groundbreaking work happening in the service, and DARPA, and our dozens of DOD labs, and engineering centers across the country. A wide range of technologies -- undersea systems, electronic warfare, big data analytics, energy and propulsion, robotics, A.I., advanced sensing and computing, the whole gamut.  These funds also support our nationwide network of public-private manufacturing innovation institutes, which are an interesting thing. We're working with companies, university research labs, to fund technologies like 3D -- actually create ecosystems surrounding technology core. 3D printing, advanced materials, integrated photonics and digital manufacturing and design are some we've done already. We announced the newest one last month in Boston, I did, focused on revolutionary textiles that combine fibers with electronics to create fabrics that can sense, communicate, store energy, monitor health, change color, much more.  Another we announced last fall, I did right here in the Valley actually, that aims -- last year, was focused, and is focused on flexible hybrid electronics which would make it possible to seriously print lightweight flexible structural integrity sensors right onto ships bridges, cars, and aircraft.  Meanwhile, we're also investing to make DOD a leader in cyber security. The Department of Defense has three missions in cyberspace, and defending our networks, and weapons systems is job one. It's my highest priority to Mike Rogers. That's job one for you.  Our second mission is to help our partners across the government defend the nation against cyber-attacks. We're a part of that. And, we try to help the best we can.  The third mission, which we do ourselves, is to provide offensive cyber options that can be used in conflict as we're doing now in ISIL -- against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. We will isolate, and blackout, disrupt, fool, their networks there even as we attack them from the air, and the ground, and everywhere else we go until we've destroyed them.  Our latest defense budget, we're investing more in all of these missions. Our total for cyber in the next five years, $35 billion for innovation in cyber. A great deal of that to also support the modernization of DOD's hundreds of networks. Terry's here, that's his responsibility.  We're continuing to push forward new breakthroughs in cyber technology, like adaptive network defenses that swiftly adapt to threats, self-patch in real-time, self-diagnose, do forensics, and so forth.  Now, innovation in people and technology are necessary, but they're not sufficient. We have to have innovative processes too, and let me close on that. The world we live in demands it. While the Cold War arms race was characterized by strength, with having more, bigger and better weapons, today's era of technological competition in our field is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate everyone else. It's no longer just a matter what we buy, it is a matter, therefore, of how we buy things. How quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we're able to use them in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats.  This is a particular focus of the Strategic Capabilities Office, an organization I created back when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2012, whose job was to reimagine systems that were already in our inventory because we have tens, probably a couple hundred trillion dollars of installed base in our aircraft fleets, ship fleets, vehicles of all kinds.  His job, a guy whom I got to do that, a young guy, is to reimagine existing systems in our inventory, giving them new roles and game changing capabilities. One example that -- give you a lot of them, examples. One is the arsenal plane which takes one our oldest aircraft platforms and turns it into a flying launchpad for precision conventional weapons of all kinds. Any ship, air-to-surface, air-to-air, and so forth.  Another innovative practice we're pursuing, this one is thanks to the Defense Digital Service who helped us do this, by the way, is inviting vetted hackers to test out cyber security under a pilot program we are calling, ""Hack the Pentagon"".  You probably heard about in the press. This is similar to the bug bounties that lots of leading tech companies have. It's the first one ever in the federal government. It's ongoing, as we speak, but it's already exceeded all our expectations. Over 1,400 hackers registered discovery, and so far, more than 80 vulnerabilities that qualify for the bounty so far. All of this helping us to be more secure at a fraction of the cost that exhaustively diagnosing ourselves would take.  We believe this approach effectively crowdsourcing cybersecurity has great potential for us, as it does for a number of you around the table.  To stay innovative going forward, DOD has to continue to be open to new ideas, and new partnerships. That's why we embarked on initiatives like our start-up here in the Valley. I did it shortly after I became Secretary of Defense, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx, over at Moffett Field. I was there this morning to announce that we're (integrating?), we're taking this effort to the next level. I call it DIUx 2.0, nothing original about that, but it does signify that we learn, adjust, restart things. So, we're doing a, kind of, new release of that to reflect in part what we've learned over the last year.  We're going to have a second such office. This one in Boston. A little bit different center of gravity, technically, there. A little bit more bio-tech and engineering, although everybody has everything.  The new DIUx, or widen DIUx is going to have more processing power, we're going to have more money behind it. More money of all kinds. Faster money.  We have a new leadership structure, a new partnership-based leadership. Again, trying to flatten ourselves, which we think would be more effective, underneath Raj Shah. I think Raj Shah is here. Raj, are you here? National Guardsman, F-16 pilot -- there he is. Combat veteran, co-founder and CEO of a successful technology start-up, everything you want in somebody who can see both sides of the equation.  I hope you'll get a chance to meet with him and his team in the future. And, we're going to keep integrating together, keep learning from each other.  That's one reason why I created a Defense Innovation Board, also, which I'm very pleased that Alphabet's Eric Schmidt agreed to Chair. He's doing a great job of putting together the rest of the board. We're going to have our first working session next week, so stay tuned for who else will be joining that board. I'm looking forward very much to what they'll be doing.  I've asked them to help us stay imbued with this culture of innovation. It's one of the enduring characteristics of our institutions, one of the things that makes us the best. It's not surprising that the most innovative society in human history also has the finest national security structure of any society.  It's an exciting time. It reminds me of the collaboration between companies, universities, and government that built the Internet, and GPS. I remember that. Before that communication satellites and jet engines, and I'm happy to say I'm not that old, but I read about it.  Those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And, that's also true for those interested in technology, but the intersection of the two, that is really very interesting, and many opportunities for partnership in everything we face.  These issues, as you know, because you've taken the time to sit here today, these really matter. They have to do with our protection and our security in creating a world where our fellow citizens can get up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, give their children a better future. You can't do that without security.  Helping defend your country, helping defend all this, and make a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur or young person can do, and we're grateful to all of you for doing that with us. Thanks.  -END-  ",National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/800928/national-security-telecommunications-advisory-committee/
"March 7, 2018","Mr. Minister, Ambassador – it’s good to have you here. You and your delegation are most welcome. After last seeing you at February’s NATO Defense Ministerial, it is good to see Estonia and America’s flags flying side by side over the Pentagon steps just now. I congratulate you on the 100th anniversary of Estonia’s independence this year. You are a young country – and we don’t say that very often around here… Since your independence, our two nations have steadily fostered strong relations, bolstered by our shared democratic values and desire for transatlantic unity. The United States remains steadfastly committed to Baltic defense, as NATO reinforces respect for territorial integrity and guards against common security threats, like those posed by Russia, as it seeks to redraw international borders by force and pursues veto authority over European nations’ diplomatic, economic, and security decisions. As Secretary-General Stoltenberg said this last Monday, “NATO does not want a new cold war… we are responding because we see a more assertive Russia.” Since 2012, Estonia has exceeded the Wales Pledge, with more than two percent of GDP spent on defense spending, demonstrating your commitment to share the defense burden for Europe and ensuring NATO remains fit for our times. We also appreciate Estonia’s offer to deploy up to 40 additional personnel to the mission in Afghanistan – thank you for that very real support. Your pragmatic response to the cyber attack in 2007, following the relocation of a Red Army soldier statue in Tallinn, gave rise to NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence. Today provides a welcome opportunity to recognize your nation’s leadership in this domain and to discuss the next steps for cyber cooperation. We appreciate your leadership in this new area of competition. Estonia’s efforts illustrate the size of a nation is less important than its commitment to its own and regional security. Your nation truly punches above its weight. I look forward to discussing steps to strengthen our military-to-military relationship, ensuring that we pass our freedoms intact to the next generation of our citizens. Mr. Minister, you are most welcome here. # # # ",Remarks at Bilateral Meeting with Estonian Minister of Defence Luik,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1460918/remarks-at-bilateral-meeting-with-estonian-minister-of-defence-luik/
"Aug. 9, 2014","Director Joshi, thank you.  I also want to thank Prime Minister Modi, National Security Adviser Doval, Minister Swaraj, and especially my host over the last two days here in India, Minister Jaitley, for productive meetings yesterday.  We had the opportunity to speak on the phone a couple of months ago, and during that telephone conversation framed up some of the agenda of what we would discuss on this trip to India.  And I particularly appreciate his leadership at this particularly important time, as has been noted by Director Joshi.  And I'll reflect further on Director Joshi's comments here in my remarks. I want to also thank the Observer Research Foundation for hosting this event, and congratulate ORF on its upcoming 25th anniversary.  I think as you articulated clearly, the importance of ORF to India, to relationship-building, to constructing platforms, where we have more opportunities to approach each other, understand each other: Those always lead not just to productive dialogue, but eventually to actions and tangible results.  So to ORF, thank you. The work of the scholars here at ORF -- from defense to development to climate change -- speaks to the vibrancy, the vibrancy of Indian civil society.  ORF's contributions also embody the deep, democratic commitments shared by India and the United States:  to open societies; free-wheeling political debate; and freedom, dignity, and opportunity for all our citizens. Our thoughts today are with Jaswant Singh -- as we all know, one of India's most distinguished solider-statesmen -- who helped transform U.S.-India relations and I know is a friend to many of you here in the audience. As some of you know, I had the privilege of visiting India as a United States Senator on more than one occasion, and I am proud to have been a consistent advocate for a strong U.S.-India relationship over the years I served in the United States Senate.  The last of my Senate visits was here in India, was with a couple of friends and former Senate colleagues, that have done fairly well in their careers, Biden and Kerry.  Just shows you, if you work hard, pay attention, things work out. Today, I'd like to reflect on America's relationship with India.  My remarks will be focused on this special relationship.  And as the director noted, as we look forward to President Obama and Prime Minister Modi's summit in Washington next month, there will be a particular focus, as there should be, on this relationship. I know President Obama is very much looking forward to this meeting.  I was with him the day before I left for India, and he noted again how much he was looking forward to this opportunity that will happen next month to visit with your new leader and talk about the specific areas where we can advance and deepen and strengthen this partnership. America's future -- our future -- is clearly tied to its sustained global engagement, and a stronger strategic partnership with India is an integral part of that future.  The President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and I all believe that a stronger U.S.-India partnership is critical for continued peace and prosperity, not just in the Asia-Pacific, but around the globe. So with all that's going on in the world, I very much appreciate the opportunity to be back here in India, discussing this relationship. In few places in the world other than in India and America could the child of a small-town tea salesman rise to become Prime Minister...or a child raised in Indonesia, born to a Kenyan father and a Kansan mother, rise to become President. It's no coincidence that millions of Indian-Americans have thrived in the United States, that one of the world's mainlines of innovation courses through Silicon Valley and Bangalore, and that M.I.T. and I.I.T. are the envy of the world.  It's also no coincidence that Mahatma Gandhi drew inspiration from [Henry] David Thoreau, that Martin Luther King, Jr., was moved by Gandhi, or that the father of India's constitution, B.R. Ambedkar, liked to quote Jefferson and Lincoln. India's recent national elections -- the world's largest organized human activity -- saw more than 550 million citizens, about 8 percent of the world's population, turn out to vote.  They were spirited, but overwhelmingly peaceful.  The loyal opposition graciously conceded.  India's elections this year were a reminder for both our nations that democracy is not just how we vote; it is who we are. That heritage is something Indians will rightly celebrate on their Independence Day, six days from now.  Like the United States, India's rise has also been grounded not only in power, but principle.  As an accountable democracy, India is lending its support to an open and inclusive rules-based global order, an order that promotes peace and prosperity for Indians, and for all people around the world. The fundamentals of the U.S.-India partnership are strong.  The question -- and what I focused on yesterday in my talks with Indian leaders -- is whether India and the United States can achieve the enormous potential for this partnership...whether we can transform our potential into results.  Following my conversations yesterday, I'm more confident than ever that we can. We will not agree on every issue, on every proposal.  Nor do the closest of friends.  Each of our nations will move forward on our own terms, at our own pace.  But today, as India ""looks east"" and the United States ""rebalances,"" our interests across the full span of the Indo-Pacific region are aligning more closely than ever. As many of you know, that wasn't always the case.  For decades, it seemed as though there was great potential for the U.S.-India partnership, and that there always would be... When my old friend and Senate colleague Daniel Patrick Moynihan was serving as U.S. Ambassador to India 40 years ago, he was asked what the Secretary of State should say on a scheduled visit to India.  Moynihan's message back to Washington was succinct and revealing.  He cabled back to Washington, ""The Secretary should come to Delhi"" and offer ""praise for India...praise for its leaders...praise for its great future...and nothing more."" We've come a long way since that cable.  At the turn of the century, under the government of Prime Minister Vajpayee, India ""crossed the rubicon,"" as ORF's Raja Mohan put it, and welcomed -- and the Prime Minister welcomed deeper ties with the United States.  Together, our nations ushered in a new era of partnership.  Building on our shared traditions of professionalism and civilian control, our defense establishments have worked and operated more closely than ever before. We have become accustomed to speaking candidly and directly with each other -- because that is what friends do.  At a time of divided government in Washington, when the White House and Congress often don't see eye-to-eye, there continues to be overwhelming bipartisan support for stronger U.S.-India ties.  Here in India, there is also consistent, cross-party support for a stronger partnership. This evolution unfolded not because our security interests have fundamentally changed, but because they have converged. Here in India, long-term investments in education and innovation began paying enormous dividends in a liberalized economy -- dividends that will be sustained over the long-term by India's young demography. Over the last two decades, India has doubled its share of global GDP and joined the United States as a major stakeholder in a stable global order.  Both our nations also became more deeply invested in the Asia-Pacific, especially the Asian-Pacific future, because over the next two decades nearly half the world's economic growth will be generated in this broader region.  There will be almost 1 billion new members of a middle class in India, China, and across Southeast Asia. To pursue prosperity at home, both our nations must uphold a just, inclusive, and secure order.  This requires continued cooperation that guards against regional instability.  It requires countering terrorism and violent extremism.  We also have a shared stake in the security of global energy and natural resource supplies, and the free flow of commerce. We seek to protect freedom of navigation in the air and sea, and ensure the peaceful resolution of disputes.  We have a shared interest in maritime security across the region, including at the global crossroads of the South China Sea.  For all these reasons, India continues to ""look east,"" and the United States is pursuing its strategic rebalance.  These complementary efforts headline our nations' converging interests. Prime Minister Modi said in May, ""The oldest democracy in the world and the largest democracy in the world are natural allies, and we must work together towards global peace and prosperity."" I agree.  President Obama agrees.  Our partnership could help shape the course of this young century. That's why the United States is working with India to expand our ties in sectors all across our commercial scope, from energy to trade to education and innovation, which is what Secretary of State Kerry and Secretary of Commerce Pritzker focused on in the U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue held here last week. The United States is also committed to exercising its leadership to support India's rise as a global power.  We have worked to expand the role of the G-20 and called for India, in the years ahead, to become a permanent member of a reformed U.N. Security Council. We also led international efforts to open India's global access to civil nuclear technology under the government of Prime Minister Singh.  I am proud to have been a strong supporter of this landmark initiative as a United States Senator, and that was, in fact, the focus of my 2008 visit to India with then-Senators Biden and Kerry. The United States strongly supports India's growing global influence and military capabilities, including its potential as a security provider from the Indian Ocean to the greater Pacific. Helping fulfill that potential is a deepening U.S.-India defense partnership, a partnership that must be cooperative, cutting-edge, consequential, and based on common interests...strengthening our military-to-military relations, re-energizing our defense industrial cooperation, and expanding our regional cooperation. Regular and frequent engagement between our militaries helps forge a common and cooperative strategic culture.  It helps instill trust and resilience in our broader partnership.  And it ensures our forces are operationally prepared to deter conflict. Over the last several years, our militaries have done more joint exercises than ever before.  This year's MALABAR -- our oldest joint exercise -- concluded last week, and included Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces.  Last month, India participated in the Rim of the Pacific exercise for the first time.  This week, India joined the United States -- and nearly 17 other nations -- in FORTUNE GUARD, a maritime exercise focused on interdicting weapons of mass destruction. After a hiatus of nearly 40 years, our armies began exercising together a decade ago.  Today, exercise YUDH ABHYAS has expanded dramatically.  The last exercise convened the Indian army's hardened 9th Mountain Brigade, 5th Gurkha Rifles, and the U.S. Army's 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne, at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  This year's exercise -- next month -- will include a special operations component and transport U.S. soldiers based in Alaska to India's rolling central highlands. Going forward, we should continue building up the scale and complexity of all our joint military exercises. We are also pursuing other, innovative avenues of military-to-military cooperation.  Our navies could pioneer new cooperation in the area of operational energy, finding ways to increase the efficiency, and thereby the capability and safety, of maritime operations.  This collaboration would have financial and technological benefits, and it could be expanded across all our military services. Together, we can also learn from India's leadership in international peacekeeping, particularly in Africa.  There is room to grow the partnership between our peacekeeping centers of excellence. Yesterday, there was a common theme in my discussions with the Indian leadership.  We agreed that, in pursuing next steps in our partnership, we have to be result-oriented and build momentum with concrete achievements.  As our interests align, so should our armed forces and defense systems.  Bureaucratic red tape -- within either of our governments -- must not bound the limits of our partnership and or our initiatives.  That is especially true for our defense industrial cooperation, which lays the foundation for deeper operational collaboration. Because of our progress to date, Indian P-8 maritime reconnaissance aircraft are patrolling the shores of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Indian C-130s have flown humanitarian rescue missions from the foothills of the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal.  And Minister Jaitley greeted the arrival of India's sixth and newest C-17 at Palam Air Base last week. Since 2008, over $9 billion in defense contracts have been signed between the United States and India, compared with less than $500 million for all the years prior. But we can do more to forge a defense industrial partnership -- one that would transform our nations' defense cooperation from simply buying and selling to co-production, co-development, and freer exchange of technology.  And we have no better opportunity than the U.S.-India Defense Trade and Technology Initiative, or DTTI. Announced by Secretary Panetta here in Delhi two years ago, and shepherded by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, DTTI was based on a simple premise:  The top leadership here in India and in the United States decided to raise our strategic partnership to a new level, and we needed a new way of doing business.  We agreed that, to help ensure that India's military becomes as capable as it could be, we needed deeper and broader defense trade and technology cooperation. DTTI is about much more than defense deals.  It is designed to support the development of a strong and self-sufficient Indian defense industrial base -- one that develops mutually beneficial, long-term partnerships with top American defense companies, and helps create jobs in both our nations.  The United States has made no similar effort with any other nation; it is unique to our relationship with India. This initiative was not designed to replace either of our nations' basic procedures for buying, selling, developing, or producing defense systems.  Nor was it designed to change the basic principles that govern our two nations' complex defense industrial ecosystems.  Instead, it was crafted to ensure that our defense development and production activities reflect our shared strategic imperative: the imperative of closer partnership. The DTTI now has on the table over a dozen specific cooperative proposals, proposals that would transfer significant qualitative capability, technology, and production know-how. To build a broad foundation for co-development, and because both our nations hone the leading edge of scientific and technological innovation, we are also working together to advance our joint Cooperative Science and Technology Priorities.  This includes areas ranging from big data to cognitive sciences to chemical and biological defense, and material sciences. Going forward, the United States welcomes new proposals from India, especially in areas we can most productively partner in co-production and co-development. But the challenge today is not a shortage -- not a shortage of proposals.  Instead, for both our nations, the challenge is to seize the opportunities...those opportunities that are before us today. On some, we are nearing agreement.  The Indian government's recently proposed reforms on foreign direct investment (FDI) caps will help move us forward.  Further progress and clarity on FDI caps and offsets would help push our defense relationship toward its full potential. Last September, President Obama and Prime Minister Singh agreed to identify and pursue specific opportunities for cooperation in advanced defense technologies and systems within a year.  Because we need to build success upon success, we should take up this challenge. A clear candidate to build momentum on the DTTI is the proposal -- familiar to many of you -- to not only co-produce, but also co-develop the next generation of the Javelin anti-tank missile.  This is an unprecedented offer that we have made only to India and no one else.  To ensure our defense industrial cooperation receives the attention it demands, in May I announced that I was directing the Pentagon's Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Frank Kendall -- who is here today along with Ambassador Stephens -- to lead and advance the DTTI. Later this afternoon, along with Assistant Secretary of State Puneet Talwar and Undersecretary Kendall, I will host a roundtable with leaders of India's defense industry.  Undersecretary Kendall also plans to return to Delhi later this year.  And I will play an active and committed and personal role in expanding the DTTI, because it is -- it is a centerpiece of our defense partnership. The DTTI and enhanced military-to-military cooperation will enable our nations to expand our regional security cooperation.  And as India expands its own security role in South Asia and throughout the Pacific, the United States will continue to support and encourage India's peaceful ambition. By inviting South Asia's leaders to his inauguration, Prime Minister Modi signaled a commitment to better relations with Pakistan and India's other neighbors.  By providing assistance to Afghanistan's security forces, and significant humanitarian and development support, India has invested in long-term regional stability.  As Minister Jaitley and I discussed yesterday, the United States remains committed to supporting Afghanistan's security forces over the next two years of transition, including beyond 2016.  Recognizing India's stake in Afghanistan's progress and stability, the United States will expand its regional security consultations with India.  This will ensure that, over the coming years of transition, assistance to Afghanistan's security forces is supported and coordinated by the international community.  We will also continue to build on years of counterterrorism cooperation. India is also assuming significant security responsibilities beyond South Asia -- through its participation in humanitarian assistance and relief efforts, peacekeeping, counter-piracy, and other maritime security operations. In the Indian Ocean, our navies have cooperated for more than a decade, in efforts ranging from tsunami relief to the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.  India is strengthening Asia's regional order by playing a more active role in its multilateral institutions.  It has also deepened its bilateral relationships across the region -- with, among others, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, where I am headed later today. Just as America need not choose between its Asian alliances and a constructive relationship with China, India need not choose between closer partnership with America and improved ties with China.  In our relations with Beijing, both Delhi and Washington seek to manage competition, but avoid the traps of rivalry.  We will continue to seek a stable and peaceful order in which China is a fellow trustee, working cooperatively with both our nations. As U.S. and Indian security interests continue to converge, so should our partnerships with other nations.  The United States and India should consider expanding our trilateral security cooperation with Japan, building on our combined naval participation in MALABAR.  We should elevate our trilateral defense cooperation by consulting at the ministerial level. To ensure that the United States and India's broader defense cooperation is sustained and strengthened -- all of this well into the next decade -- we look forward to the next meeting of the U.S.-India Defense Policy Group. Yesterday, I invited Minister Jaitley to attend a meeting that I would host with Secretary of State Kerry, Secretary of Commerce Pritzker, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marty Dempsey when the Minister is in Washington this fall.  This consultation could begin discussions on a renewed and expanded defense framework with the current one expiring next year, and it would include the U.S. agencies -- Defense, State, and Commerce -- that hold the keys to deeper defense cooperation.  Because U.S.-India defense cooperation is a top priority for President Obama and me, it deserves the attention of the U.S. government's most senior leaders. To advance all of our shared priorities, I have also invited Prime Minister Modi to visit the Pentagon when he visits Washington next month. In his inaugural address in May, the Prime Minister said that ""an era of responsibility has begun.""  India seeks to meet the needs of 1 million new job seekers every month, provide electricity and sanitation for hundreds of millions every day, and retool its business sector for renewed growth for years to come. The Indian government has made clear that these are its top priorities. The responsibility that the Prime Minister has called for also applies to our strategic partnership, because our partnership will help enable India -- and the United States -- to accelerate domestic growth in both of our countries. A strong strategic partnership between the United States and India is a responsibility, not a slogan.  It is a responsibility that our governments owe not only to our own citizens, but to all nations and all peoples who seek a more peaceful and prosperous future. Our values are shared.  Our interests are aligned.  Our focus and energy are surging. I leave India today confident that, together, our two nations will achieve the historic potential of this special partnership. And I look forward to further discussions, and especially our discussion this afternoon. And, again, to all of you, thank you for what you do for this partnership, and thank you for an opportunity to share some thoughts this afternoon.  Thank you very much.

"Aug. 30, 2017"," Welcome Minister, your Excellency Ambassador Ahn, and military officers, members of the delegation. Welcome to the Pentagon. You are most welcome here. Thank you for traveling to Washington so soon after your assignment to this post. It is good to meet you in person after we had already spoken earlier this month. This says a great deal about the priority you and your President place on our relationship to come so soon. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance has played an enduring role in regaining and maintaining South Korea’s security since 1950. As President Moon remarked earlier this week, our alliance serves as the foundation of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our countries share a commitment to democratic values, and we work together to maintain a stable environment in which all pacific nations can prosper. For 64 years, our countries’ mutual defense treaty has provided a rock-solid basis for collaboration on defense measures – measures designed to keep that peace, to protect the South Korean people and uphold vital American interests. As we have seen the threat to security in the Northwest Pacific become more severe, our nations’ defense relationship thus becomes more important than ever and a bedrock for international efforts to temper North Korea’s aggressive actions. The recent United Nations Security Council sanctions and ASEAN communique demonstrate the international community’s resolve against North Korean actions. Last evening’s Security Council actions show that the world will not stand for North Korea’s reckless and intolerable behavior. Here in Washington we are keenly aware that South Korea is on the frontline and we cannot be complacent. We note with confidence that you have pledged to increase defense spending under President Moon. In the interest of keeping our alliance fit for these times, we must continue to deepen our military relationship, building on the high level of trust that exists between our two nations. As you say in Korean, katchi kapshida, or “we go forward together.” Minister Song, I look forward to the usual transparent dialogue on how we will work together, in what you called an honest and candid conversation. Again Minister, Excellency, and members of the delegation, welcome to the Pentagon.   #  #  #  ",Secretary Mattis Remarks at Bilateral Meeting with Republic of Korea Defense Minister Song Young-Moo,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1294852/secretary-mattis-remarks-at-bilateral-meeting-with-republic-of-korea-defense-mi/
"Dec. 3, 2016","Good evening, everyone.  This speech is not going to be about physics or medieval history, but thank you, Ann [Korologos], I appreciate it.  And thanks to everyone at the Reagan Foundation. For this award, I’m pleased to join its distinguished group of recipients, and my wife Stephanie and I are pleased to be with you all – all of you this evening. The Reagan Forum is always an opportunity to see some of the many colleagues past and present, public servants, and leaders, who’ve continued to ensure the greatness of America’s military. You’ve honored one of those leaders tonight.  Vice President Dick Cheney, congratulations.  Now, I see Dick’s portrait out in the Secretary of Defense Hallway every day at the Pentagon, but it’s good to be here with him, and with our new U.S. Representative-elect, Liz. Even in that hallway of paintings, amid some of the giants and the history makers who’ve led the Defense Department, Dick Cheney stands out for the breadth and depth of his service to our country.  Through strategic era after strategic era – whether at the White House or in Congress, on the E-Ring or as Vice President – Dick has helped ensure the continued, continued excellence of our military today, which I’m privileged to lead. We haven’t done – neither of us have had to do that alone.  This award and this evening represent the continuity and the excellence, which I spoke about earlier today.  For decades, we’ve worked with many of you here in this room for “Peace through Strength.” While we Americans may disagree at times on specifics, together, with many of the people in this room and many others, we’ve all worked under the belief that America is most secure and the world is most peaceful when the United States and its military have the strength to lead, to defend our country, and to make a better world. And I am confident, confident, and hopeful, that we can continue to come together to ensure that ours remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And that’s because every day – and on every trip like the one I’m about to take to the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe – I see soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are helping to defend this country during, like I said earlier, a time of strategic transition. Today, as we are here this evening, there are almost 3 million of them serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, and in every domain – all in service to our great nation. Because of their continued excellence, we can be confident we’ll meet the challenges of today’s strategic transition and also the uncertain future. All of them are defending not only the United States and its people; they’re also defending the values and principles that define us, and which are why we have so many friends and allies around the world and our antagonists have few. And because of their continued excellence, Americans can celebrate these upcoming holidays with family and friends.  They can live their lives, they can dream their dreams, and they can enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought, and leave a better world for their children. DoD’s people make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, we need to make sure they know – and Americans know – that we don’t take them for granted.  Stephanie and I begin every day thinking of them.  So I thank you – I thank you for this award, and I thank you for all the support you give our men and women in uniform. But above all, I want you to cast your thoughts in this upcoming holiday season to those 3 million wonderful, talented, dedicated people.  Keep them in your thoughts, keep them in your words so that others who don’t know, but should know, can understand what they do – the significance of it and the fact we can’t take any of it for granted. Bless them.  Bless all of you in this holiday season. And of course, above all, bless the United States of America. Thank you so much. ",Remarks on Receiving the Ronald Reagan Peace Through Strength Award,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/1020802/remarks-on-receiving-the-ronald-reagan-peace-through-strength-award/
"Dec. 3, 2016","Thank you all, and good afternoon,.  And John, thank you – thank  you for that kind introduction.  It’s good to be back at the Reagan Forum. And I’m pleased to join so many long-time friends of mine and the Defense Department’s among the dedicated and patriotic Americans here – including two of my predecessors, former Secretary of Defense and former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta – as well as so many dedicated public servants, like Chairman Mac Thornberry and the Congressional delegation here today; current colleagues, including my Deputy, Bob Work, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford, and I believe Joe had to leave a little while ago but I know was here earlier today; and many others who contribute to our defense enterprise, such as Lockheed-Martin’s CEO Marillyn Hewson, I don’t know if Marillyn is here, and Raytheon’s CEO Tom Kennedy – all part of the team, America. Thanks all for your continued support for our servicemembers and their families – there’s Marillyn – and for all your own contributions to our national security. Each of you knows well that America’s defense is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must ensure its continuity and excellence across the years and across the domains of armed conflict – not just sea and air and land, but also in space, and cyberspace – from strategic era to strategic era, from presidential administration to presidential administration, across our government, and across parties. Ensuring that continuity is important at a time of change in administration in Washington.  I’m proud of the way the men and women of DoD conducted themselves during this last presidential campaign, standing apart from politics and staying focused on our mission.  And I’m committed to overseeing the orderly transfer to the next Commander-in-Chief.  That’s something DoD takes a lot of pride in and has done for a long time, and we’re carrying out this year’s changeover with the excellence that’s expected of us.  And let me also congratulate General Jim Mattis for being chosen to take my place.  I’ve worked with Jim for many years.  He’s a friend, and I hold him in the highest regard. Of course, the excellence that people expect of our department is due, in part, to the continuity and leadership defense secretaries of both parties have provided to the department over the last seven decades.  Each one of them has strengthened DoD to meet the challenges of their strategic eras, and the future challenges as they saw them, too – with bold actions such as unifying the armed forces at the dawn of the nuclear age; moving to an all-volunteer force after the Vietnam War; leveraging leap-ahead technologies like stealth, precision-guided munitions, and battle networks to forge an unmatched military edge against the Soviet bloc; winning the Cold War and defining U.S. leadership in the era that followed; and waging 21st century counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns. I, myself, have lived through, witnessed, and served in all but the earliest of those eras and the strategic transitions between them also:  contributing to programs involving missile defense, space, and the nuclear Triad during the Cold War; overseeing the project to prevent the vast stockpile of Soviet nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from falling into the wrong hands after the Cold War ended; and in more recent years helping develop and rapidly field critical capabilities like Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles for the fights in Afghanistan and Iraq among other places. In this strategic transition, that we’re in right now, we must widen the spectrum of our current and future capabilities to account for this great change – the great change economic, political, military, social, and technological under way – and the greater and the fiercer competition we face.  And I say this because today, DoD confronts no fewer than five immediate, but also distinct, and evolving challenges. We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe – something we haven’t had to worry about for the last 25 years, but now we do.  We’re also managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re countering terrorism and accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL.  And, of course, we’re also preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring our military is ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. Defending our country in this strategic transition requires that our military be able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will, as we must, be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our training, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we will win it.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict.  That’s the kind of force I’ve been determined to build for my successors. And that’s why, amidst this strategic transition, it has been necessary – and it will be necessary – for DoD to change, to adapt, and to innovate – not only to meet today’s challenges, but also to ensure our defense’s continued excellence well into an uncertain future. So I want to speak today about how the changes underway to respond to all these challenges – focusing particularly on the military campaign to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, our Strong and Balanced Strategy on Russia, and the rebalance to the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific.  And I’ll also describe the actions we’re taking – and pioneering innovations underway – to ensure DoD has the technology, the operational plans, the organization, and the people to continue to defend our country and make a better world for decades to come. Let me start in the Middle East, a region of great turbulence and confusion, but where we are not confused – we’re clear about our pursuit of America’s national interests.  Among them is dealing ISIL the lasting defeat that it deserves, and that it will certainly receive. We’ve reached a critical milestone in our counter-ISIL military campaign plan.  As we meet today in Simi Valley, American forces are engaged in an intense effort to isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, bringing the great weight of our entire range of capabilities to bear in the enabling of capable and motivated local forces.  The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria – the primary objective of our military campaign – and put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat. Reaching this milestone is the result of deliberate actions taken since last year.  First, and going back to last summer, I consolidated the war command for Iraq and Syria under a single, unified command – streamlining our command-and-control for the fight against ISIL.  Then, last October, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations that I and Joe Dunford made to accelerate the campaign against ISIL – introducing every single tool of our military to the fight, from air power and special operations forces, to our train, advise, assist capabilities on the ground, to our intelligence and cyber tools.  And I should tell you that since then, President Obama has approved every single recommendation that the Chairman and I have taken to him for additional forces and capabilities as we saw – as we constantly have – additional opportunities to accelerate the campaign. The overall Coalition Military Campaign Plan we devised last year has three objectives: The first is to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, because the sooner we crush both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology, the safer we’ll all be.  Now, that’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient. So the second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world: in Afghanistan, Libya, and elsewhere. And the third objective is to work with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners to help protect our homelands and our people from attack – that’s ultimately our most important mission. The strategic approach of our campaign is to leverage all the tools at DoD’s disposal to enable capable and motivated local forces to apply simultaneous pressure to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  We recommended this strategic approach because the only way to ensure that once defeated, ISIL stays defeated, is to enable local forces to seize and hold territory rather than to substitute for them.  We’ve been squeezing ISIL from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate plays to continue to build momentum.  For example, when our special operators conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders, it creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, which generates more targets and more raids and more air strikes and more opportunities we can seize to gain even more momentum. And as a result, since last year – play by play, accelerant after accelerant, town after town– the campaign has delivered significant results. In Iraq, we’ve been helping the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to systematically dislodge ISIL from city after city – Ramadi, Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Qayyarah, Mahkmur.  And our coalition is now doing the same in Mosul – having isolated the city, the Iraqis with our help are now taking back neighborhoods in eastern Mosul and moving west.  This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered. In Syria, we and our local partners put an end to ISIL’s expansion and then began to systematically roll it back toward Raqqa, an important objective since it is the so-called capital of the so-called caliphate, and a hub for plotters of external attacks.  After helping capable, motivated local Syrian forces defend Kobani, we and the coalition enabled them and other local forces to retake Shaddadi, then Tishrin, Manbij, Dabiq – denying ISIL not only control over those areas, but also cutting off some of their primary lines of communication into Turkey and Iraq. We’re now helping our local partners isolate Raqqa, from which they’re now only 15 miles away.  And as the isolation phase continues according to our coalition military campaign plan, we’re generating the additional local forces necessary to seize and hold Raqqa. In addition to taking back territory, our campaign is yielding results in denying ISIL the finances, supplies, freedom of movement, and command and control it needs to survive.  We’ve systematically targeted ISIL-controlled oil wells, trucks for smuggling the oil, and revenue repositories.  We’ve deliberately focused on severing the territory ISIL controls in Syria from the territory it controls in Iraq.  Leaders of the terrorist group can no longer travel between Raqqa and Mosul without the risk of either being hunted down by our Expeditionary Targeting Force or struck from the air.  In fact, since we began accelerating our campaign last year, we’ve killed some of ISIL’s most senior leaders. While these results in Iraq and Syria are encouraging, we must stay focused on the continued execution of our plan.  The inevitable collapse of ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa will certainly put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  But there will still be much more to do after that to make sure that, once defeated, ISIL stays defeated. We’ll need to continue to counter foreign fighters trying to escape and ISIL’s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself.  To do so, not only the United States but our coalition must endure and remain militarily engaged. In Iraq in particular, it will be necessary for the coalition to provide sustained assistance and carry on our work to train, equip, and support local police, border guards, and other forces to hold the areas cleared from ISIL. And beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Those aren’t military matters, but they’re part of how, after winning the battle, one wins the peace.  That’s why my principal concern at this juncture is that the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts will lag behind the military campaign. There will also need to be continued political support for an inclusive and multi-sectarian Iraq.  In a region rife with sectarianism, the threat of ISIL has brought people together, for now, against this common enemy.  That’s certainly true in Iraq – where, thanks to the unity and leadership of Prime Minister Abadi and Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani, cooperation between the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga in the battle to retake Mosul has reached a level that would have been unthinkable a year ago.  And we’re taking steps to help promote and maintain this unity – for we know that’s the only way to keep ISIL defeated. As I said earlier, success in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  And that’s why we’re also focused on the other two critical objectives of our campaign – combatting ISIL’s metastases around the world, and helping protect our homeland. When it comes to combatting the metastases, we’ve taken correspondingly strong actions in support of capable and motivated local forces in Libya and Afghanistan and elsewhere. In Libya, the U.S. military has provided air support to the Government of National Accord and its forces to isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over Sirte.  And as a result, ISIL is being ejected from Sirte. And in Afghanistan, on Chairman Dunford’s and my recommendation, the President this year gave expanded authorities to U.S. forces to proactively assist and enable our Afghan partners in operations that would have strategic effects.  We also decided to modify our plan in order to retain some 8,400 U.S. troops there into 2017, rather than 5,500 as the earlier plan had called for.  And we will continue to maintain our financial commitment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.  These robust commitments – in authorities and forces and finances – will ensure we not only continue supporting the Afghan security forces, but also sustain our regional counterterrorism platform operated out of Afghanistan.  For example, alongside our Afghan partners, we recently conducted two large-scale operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, killing its top leader in the country and significantly degrading its capabilities there. On our campaign’s third objective, protecting the homeland, DoD is working with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners both at home – in fact, supporting them is job number-one and priority number one for our Northern Command – but also abroad. There, we’re conducting operations to gather intelligence with a particular focus on destroying ISIL’s external operations cadre.  As a result, we’ve not only killed the chief of ISIL’s external operations, we’ve also taken out more than 30 of its external plotters.  We’ve gone after Al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.  We’ve worked with the FBI to systematically eliminate members of an ISIL cell outside the United States that was inspiring attacks against in our country, and including against our armed forces.  And we’ve directed our Joint Special Operations Command to make its top priority destroying ISIL’s external operations capability. The campaign against ISIL and its results are another example of our military’s continued excellence and America’s continued leadership in the Middle East and the world.  No other nation could have brought to bear the resources we have, assembled the coalition we’ve built, and led the execution of a comprehensive campaign as the United States has done.  We did so in pursuit of our nation’s interests – which in this case are aligned with many allies and partners who are also resolved to destroy ISIL; and we did so despite major, simultaneous, and growing military commitments in Europe and Asia.  And let me now turn to them. First, I want to discuss Europe, where the Transatlantic Community is standing up to Russia’s provocations and aggression. That’s a big change for many of us who worked productively with Russia in the post-Cold War era.  I know I did so in the 1990s when our two nations were working with sometimes, common, rather than cross, purposes.  At the time, American and Russian militaries collaborated to arrest the spread of loose nuclear weapons as part of the Nunn-Lugar program, and when Russia agreed to join the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo – I remember both. Today, unfortunately, Russia’s aggression and provocation appear to be driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced resentment.  Russia wants to be considered, understandably so, as the important power it is.  And indeed, its history is rich – one of which its people can and should be proud.  But in recent years, some in the Kremlin have reinterpreted that history to fuel grandiose visions and provocative, destabilizing actions abroad. We see that in Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Georgia, its counter-productive role in the ongoing tragedy in Syria, its attacks in cyberspace, its violation of arms-control treaties and other international agreements, and, perhaps above all, its nuclear saber-rattling.  These actions are not what the world expects of a responsible state in the twenty-first century; rather, each threatens to undermine global security and erode the principled international order that has been so good not only to the United States, but also to Russia and the world. Let me be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don’t seek an enemy in Russia.  But make no mistake – we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us.  And we will counter attempts to undermine our collective security. To do so, the United States is following a Strong and Balanced Strategy.  In it, we’re addressing Russia’s actions and deterring its aggression while pursuing and preserving bilateral cooperation where U.S. and Russian objectives can be aligned.  This strategy for deterrence does not simply recycle the twentieth-century playbook used to deter Soviet aggression during the Cold War, because that playbook would not match the Russian challenge of today. We haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on the Transatlantic Community’s eastern flank for over 20 years.  And unfortunately, now we do.  That’s why the United States is strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe, to adjust our military posture and presence in Europe to be more agile and quicker in responding to the threats that Russia might pose.  Our latest defense budget request includes significantly more funding for our European Reassurance Initiative – more than quadruple what we allocated the year before.  That’s intended to allow us to – in addition to the two brigades we already have stationed in Europe – rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team into Europe on a persistent basis, and to pre-position a brigade-worth of equipment and warfighting gear to be used by American forces flown into Europe among other steps. We’re also increasing military exercises with allies and partners to demonstrate resolve and build their resilience, while enhancing inter-operability.  We’re updating and refining our contingency and operational plans, including ways to overcome emerging threats such as hybrid warfare and anti-access, area-denial systems.  We’re investing in the technologies most relevant to countering Russia – more on these shortly.  And we’re also recapitalizing our nuclear deterrent, because nuclear deterrence is not only the bedrock of our security, but also critical to sustain in light of Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. The United States is not alone in any of this, of course.  For more than 67 years, NATO has been the quintessential example of nations coming together to respond to collective security challenges.  And as it did during the Cold War, NATO will be critical to preserving collective defense in the face of new and renewed threats.  To ensure it does so, we’re working with our allies to adapt this storied alliance to confront the new challenges NATO faces, like Russia. NATO, too, has a new playbook – one that prepares to counter cyber threats and hybrid warfare, to better integrate our conventional and nuclear deterrence, and much, much more.  That’s why NATO created a Very-High-Readiness Joint Task Force that can deploy allied forces on 48 hours’ notice to any crisis on allied territory.  It’s why NATO is also deploying four battalions to its eastern flank – one each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the latter is where the United States will lead a battalion starting next year.  And it’s why NATO is providing support to partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia to help strengthen and reform their national defense institutions and improve their ability to work with NATO. Everything the United States is doing, both on its own and with NATO, will ensure that we continue to stand up to Russian aggression, and that we’re ready for longer-term competition. But it’s also necessary to keep the door open to working with Russia, where and when our interests align.  And as I said, there was a time, in the years after the Cold War, when Russia cooperated with the United States and other nations, contributing to the principled international order rather than undermining it.  I remember that personally – and so do many of you.  And perhaps someday, we’ll see that spirit rekindled. Next, I want to discuss what we’re doing as part of President Obama’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.  It will ensure DoD continues to help provide the security necessary for that consequential region – which is home to nearly half the global population and nearly half the global economy – to remain a place where everyone can rise and prosper for decades to come. That’s been American policy and practice since the end of World War II more than 70 years ago.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has remained economically, politically, and militarily engaged in the Asia-Pacific. Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability there has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO in Europe.  That’s made sense because of the Asia-Pacific’s unique history, geography, and politics.  Instead, the United States has long taken a principled and inclusive approach, and collaborated with a network of regional allies and partners to enable security and uphold important principles like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. Because we did so, out of the rubble of World War II, economic miracle after miracle occurred.  Think about it – first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, and now, today, China, India, and others rose and prospered.  That progress has produced incredible changes in the region:  populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have spread, economies have grown more interconnected, and military spending and cooperation are both increasing. Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s interests and objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured: we still want peace, stability, and progress there for all, including ourselves.  But as the region has changed, our approach to how we meet those interests and uphold those enduring principles has had to change along with it. Today, as the Defense Department has been operationalizing one phase after another of the military part of the rebalance, we’re not only ensuring we remain the strongest military and primary provider of regional security; we’re also connecting – and further networking – our allies and partners in a burgeoning Principled and Inclusive Security Network that will allow all of us to see more, share more, and do more to maintain security in the region. In the rebalance’s first phase, which began five years ago, DoD sought to make our regional posture more robust – both on our own part and with allies and partners – geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.  To do so, DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region, committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets in the Asia-Pacific, and began to modernize our regional posture around Guam as a strategic hub. In the second phase, which we launched last year, we committed to sending some of our best people and our most advanced capabilities – our newest submarines, our newest aircraft, and our newest surface warfare vessels to the Asia-Pacific. We also developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts, and put them to use in more complex and expansive training exercises – both on our own and with our allies and partners – none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC. We’ve significantly strengthened our bilateral alliances and partnerships.  Nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice, we’ve now strengthened these relationships so they better reflect 21st century security needs.  There are so many examples to point to in the region – whether it’s our long-time alliances with the Republic of Korea and Australia, or our newer partnerships like those we’re growing with Singapore and Vietnam – but for time’s sake, I’ll focus on the two I’m leaving tomorrow to visit:  namely, Japan and India. The U.S.-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone of Asia-Pacific security.  And with their new Defense Guidelines, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger, or more capable of contributing to security in the Asia-Pacific and also beyond. Likewise, the U.S.-India defense relationship is the closest it’s ever been.  Through our strategic handshake – with America reaching west in the rebalance, and India reaching east in what Prime Minister Modi calls his Act East policy – our two nations are exercising together by air, land, and sea like never before.  And we also have a technological handshake – as the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, or DTTI, grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India campaign – that’s helping our countries move towards a more diverse co-development and co-production system for developing and procuring weaponss. Now, in the third phase of the rebalance, it will be necessary to cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second phases, and more importantly, build upon it. The United States will continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region, and the security partner of choice, by increasing and targeting investments in capabilities suited to the region to ensure we stay the best there.  More on that momentarily. We’ll also continue to make “leap-ahead” technological investments – including some surprising ones – that will help keep us in the lead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere. And we’ll further catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing Principled and Inclusive Security Network.  Although it’s not a formal alliance – as I said – like NATO, this burgeoning network is grounded in those principles I mentioned earlier.  It’s inclusive since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute.  And it’s developing in several ways. Trilateral mechanisms are bringing together trios of allies and partners that previously worked together – and the historical reasons for this are deep – only bilaterally.  For example, the blossoming U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral partnership helps us coordinate responses to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations.  Just last month, our three countries held their second-ever trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise. Next, and beyond relationships involving the United States, many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own by establishing bilateral and trilateral mechanisms.  For example, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are coordinating trilateral maritime patrols to counter piracy, organized crime, and terrorist activity in Southeast Asia.  That’s a good thing on its own, but it’s also an important step for this developing network. And even more broadly, Asia-Pacific nations are developing a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – as with, a central example, the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus serving as an important forum. That’s all to the good for the region and the United States, but it’s important to remember, the rebalance and this Asia-Pacific security network are not aimed at any particular country.  The network’s not closed and excludes no one.  Although we have disagreements with China, including over its destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea, and its behavior is in fact driving many to work more closely with us, we’re committed to working with China where possible, to introducing measures to reduce risk, and to encouraging them to avoid self-isolation. All this is happening today.  But even as we confront today’s challenges of this strategic time of transition, it will also be necessary for DoD to lead and compete well into the future. Today’s is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, or more innovative.  But that’s not a birthright, and it’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again. To do so, we have to invest and innovate for the uncertain future we face.  And that’s why I’ve been constantly pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided-box to ensure our technology, our plans, our organization, and above all, our people – we stay the best for decades to come. Our most recent budget proposal – which I continue to strongly urge appropriators in Congress to pass, as soon as possible – is designed to make sure DoD maintains our dominance in every domain.  We’re growing not only the number of ships in the fleet, but also their lethality – with new weapons like the dual-capable SM-6 missile – and we’re extending our commanding lead – commanding lead in undersea warfare.  We’re investing in our air superiority and global reach, including through advanced munitions and payloads of all kinds, and also innovative capabilities and new platforms – some more typical, like the F-35 Lightning joint strike fighter, the B-21 long-range strike bomber, and the KC-[4]6 tanker – and some less so, like swarming micro-drones, the arsenal plane, and others.  And those are just the things we can talk about here.  Meanwhile, we’re also prioritizing full-spectrum training and readiness for our ground forces.   As I mentioned earlier, we’re reversing decades of underinvestment in our nuclear deterrent, and recapitalizing it.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space to make sure we stay on the cutting edge. In addition to those investments, we’re pushing the envelope with research and development to stay ahead of our competitors and at technology’s frontier, by putting nearly $72 billion dollars into R&D this next year.  To give you a little context, that’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D last year combined. Beyond that, we’ve been building and rebuilding bridges between the Pentagon and America’s technology community.  One way we’re doing so is through our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – which I created to help connect with startups and other commercial tech firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, Texas, and everywhere in between.  And thanks to Raj Shah – and Raj, I don’t know if you’re here today.  Where are you?  There he is.  Raj Shah right there – DIUx’s managing director who’s participating in this forum, those outposts are already producing results: DIUx has interacted with companies in 31 states to help us adopt technologies more quickly that can help our warfighters accomplish their missions.  We will always need our traditional defense partners to help us build our planes, tanks, and ships, but DIUx will better connect the Pentagon to a whole new world of American innovation.  And help our own countries find new technologies and new people to bring into them.  All that’s an investment worth making. We’re also innovating operationally.  Our core contingency plans are constantly being changed to apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as anti-satellite weapons or hybrid warfare.  We’re also building in modularity, planning in new ways for overlapping contingencies, and injecting agility and flexibility into our war plans. Meanwhile we’re making reforms across the DoD enterprise –streamlining our headquarters operations, lowering our health care costs, and more.  We’re also continuing to support and seek improvements in the spirit of Goldwater-Nichols to, among other changes, clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, the Joint Chiefs, and the Joint Staff, and to help our Combatant Commands be more efficient and agile and support me and the President, especially in the face of transregional and transfunctional challenges. We’re also building on the success of our Better Buying Power initiative, which has helped reduce the growth of contracted costs for major acquisition programs – very significant.  To improve on this progress, it will be necessary to make additional changes to defense acquisition process, like streamlining the system itself, we proposed them. And we’re ensuring DoD’s a place where thinking boldly and differently, which is long a strength of America, is fostered.  One way we’re doing so is with the Defense Innovation Board I established earlier this year, chaired by Google-Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt.  Its members are already making a mark.  One of their recommendations and on their recommendation, we’re creating a Chief Innovation Officer to act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD. And lastly, we’re building what I call the Force of the Future – to ensure that amid generational, technological, and labor market changes, we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer. In total, the Force of the Future initiatives span the career of a uniformed servicemember or DoD civilian – from recruiting men and women to join, to caring for, retaining, and developing them, and then to helping successfully transition those who want to move on.  And these initiatives include reinvigorating and expanding the geographic reach of our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, which marks its 100th year this year; making common-sense improvements to military talent management and officer promotion; giving components the authority to directly hire civilians on college campuses; and recognizing survey data indicating the importance of family life to retention – after all, bear in mind that our force is largely a married force – by expanding maternity and paternity leave and extending on-base childcare hours, among other steps. To demonstrate the logic of what we’re doing, let me tell you a bit more about one way we’re helping to build the Force of the Future. As some of you may know, today is the one-year anniversary of my decision to open all combat positions to women.  I made that decision so we can benefit from the talents of every American who can meet our high standards and contribute to our mission.  In the 21st century, and in an all-volunteer force, that requires us to be able to draw from the broadest possible pool of people who can meet our stringent and uncompromising standards. That pool must include women, because they make up more than 50 percent of our population.  That’s mission critical. I directed that there be no quotas, and that is why the number of women in the previously-closed specialties may be modest.  But they will be the best talent for the job.  And even for women who don’t choose these specialties, the fact that they are open means any woman in uniform will be measured by her contribution to the force no matter what career field she chooses. In conclusion, all of the actions and decisions I’ve spelled out today were taken to do exactly what my predecessors did for me: ensure that my successor and my successors’ successors will inherit as fine a fighting force as the one I’m privileged to lead today.  Maintaining that continuity is our tradition in the Department of Defense, and one I’ve always been determined to uphold. As I mentioned, I depart tomorrow on a two-week trip to visit our American personnel serving in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe.  My wife Stephanie and I are looking forward to thanking them and their families, and wishing them all a happy holiday season from their Commander-in-Chief, and their leadership, and their country, and I’m sure from all of you. I’d ask all of you during this holiday season to help our fellow Americans to understand and appreciate what those troops are doing for them.  Each and every one is ensuring we continue to meet the challenges we face, defend our country, and make a better world – not just in this strategic transition, but well into the future. And we’re able to do so – and to bring unrivaled strength to those missions – because of the work, contributions, and ideas of people, supporters, and leaders like those in this room.  We can do so because of the decisions and leadership of presidents, defense secretaries, and senators and congressmen of both parties over decades.  And most importantly, we can do so because of the service and sacrifice of our people – every soldier, sailor, airmen, and Marine – and their families. I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing, but I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day – and for all they’ve done for all of us.  And I’m sure all of you feel the same.

"Aug. 3, 2016","Good morning, good morning fans of Frank and fans of Joe. Glad to have you all here, and I’m certainly one of you. Chairman Dunford, Ellyn, thank you for being here. General Milley, General Goldfein, General Neller, Admiral Michel, Adjutants General, international partners, friends and family, all of you, and Ambassador, thanks for joining us. It’s good to be with you all as we pass this critical responsibility between two of our military's most accomplished leaders, General Frank Grass and General Joe Lengyel. Before I speak about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary officers, I want to speak directly to all of the citizen warriors here today, and our entire National Guard family. I’m so proud of all of you, and we’re so grateful for your vital contributions to the security of our nation. You keep our skies free from danger. You respond to disaster with compassion and professionalism at a moment’s notice. You stand watch at home and around the world. You responded when we needed you during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan all those years. You help keep our most solemn commitment as a military, which is to provide our citizens the security they need to dream their dreams, raise their children, and live full lives, even if that means sometimes putting your own lives on hold, or on the line. That has been the spirit, the mission and enduring commitment of our national guard through the centuries, and never more so than over the past 15 years.  Since September 11th, the men and women of our Army and Air National Guard – and their families – have answered the nation’s call to deploy – get this – over 787,000 times. And as a result, today’s Guard is battle tested – an agile, flexible, deployable force with combat experience and a broad range of skills gained both on the battlefield and in civilian life. The National Guard is a critical component of our total force, bringing to bear the experience and skills of our citizen warriors wherever and whenever needed to confront the challenges of a complex world. And we’ve got them. Today our nation faces  – and the Guard is helping us to meet – no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving  challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and confronting terrorism, including accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and wherever it metastasizes. And as history has shown that we can never perfectly predict the strategic future – in fact it perfectly shows the opposite of that –we must also be flexible and agile in preparing for unknowns that we can’t anticipate today. We don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges.  We have to do it all.  And all around the world, the Guard does it all – from Eastern Europe, where the North Carolina National Guard equipped with HIMARS participated in exercises with 24 nations in Poland, to the Pacific, where the Hawaii National Guard 204th Airlift Squadron stands ready to respond throughout Pacific rim, to the Middle East – where 8,000 National Guard members are currently deployed in the air and on the ground, including the Wisconsin National Guard as it supports the 101st Airborne’s mission to enable local forces to take on ISIL and defeat ISIL. And right here at home, cyberwarriors like the Washington National Guard’s 262nd Network Warfare Squadron, whom I met earlier this year – wonderful, wonderful folks – are using the skills and experience they’ve gained in America’s wonderfully innovative technology community to protect our networks and to do things like counter ISIL’s influence online. The days of the National Guard serving exclusively as a strategic reserve – called up only in emergencies – are over. The post-9/11 environment has proven the Guard is an indispensable component of the Total Force, in day-to-day activities and large-scale operations, in planning and execution, and in conventional conflicts and novel threats.  The National Guard will remain critical to accomplishing all of our Nation’s security priorities. And to ensure preparedness for existing threats, the Army will double the number of rotations to the national training centers for our Guard brigade combat teams. Further, the Guard will receive an increase in the number of helicopters over the next several years, enhancing its capability as a strategic reserve and providing more flexibility for missions in the here and now including over the homeland. The Guard will be instrumental not only in fighting and winning on today’s battlefields, but also in shaping tomorrow’s conflicts, as well. As the cyber and space domains become increasingly contested, the Guard will be on the vanguard of these mission sets. By 2019, the National Guard will have over 30 cyber units in 34 states to support the services and US Cyber Command. The more deeply integrated the Guard becomes in all facets of planning and execution, the better prepared the nation becomes.  The presence, skill and readiness of citizen warriors across the country give us the agility and flexibility to handle unexpected demands, both at home and abroad. It’s an essential component of our total force, and a lynchpin of our readiness. That’s one of the reasons the position of Commander of the National Guard was elevated to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2012. And as the first National Guard Bureau Chief to serve a full term in the tank, General Frank Grass has led this historic transition with character and skill. Building on the good work of his predecessor, General Craig McKinley, who is here today, General Grass worked tirelessly with General Welsh and General Milley to form the most integrated and Total Force in our history. He’s helped increase our rapid deployment capability to respond to any crisis, and strengthened the Guard’s partnerships at the local, state, federal - and international - levels. He’s been a strong and steady voice at the table for the men and women of the National Guard, because for his entire career he has personified the finest qualities of our citizen warriors. Frank Grass has been committed to the defense of this nation since he turned eighteen and enlisted with the Missouri National Guard as a private in 1969. It was another former Missouri National Guardsman, President Harry Truman, who said, “Progress occurs when courageous, skillful leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the better.” Well Frank, you’ve changed things for the better at every stop in your career, from your first commission in the Engineering Corps, to your steadfast protection of our homeland as Deputy Commander of NORTHCOM. And as Chief of the National Guard these past four years, you’ve been a courageous and skillful leader, exactly the nation needed, and you’ve seized every opportunity to make progress, and our total force is stronger as a result. Frank, you’ve said the three critical traits of the leaders you’ve admired most are that they are analytical, decisive and compassionate – remember that? In the time we’ve served together, I’ve seen the way you’ve met all three of these standards, and as you’ve built a legacy of strength and readiness that will continue to benefit us all long into the future. Your analytical approach to homeland security and disaster situations has helped inform and advise the President, me and Chairman Dunford during times of challenge, and helped guide our national security planning to protect our nation at home against the threats of tomorrow. Your decisive actions to prioritize skills, equipment and readiness through times of budget uncertainty have turned the National Guard from a post-9/11 operational reserve of necessity into an enduring, effective operational reserve by design. And your compassionate dedication to our National Guard families has resulted in stronger community support networks, greater employer cooperation, and deeper connections to all who serve. You’ve never forgotten that families are the foundation of our force. I appreciate everything Pat has done for our National Guard families as well, and I also want to thank your children Amanda, Laura, Patrick and Mark – if you’re watching – and your many grandchildren, for their service through the years as well. So, Frank, as you and Pat begin your well-earned retirement, you can rest assured that the National Guard family is in the good hands of another proven strategic thinker and citizen warrior, the man who has served by your side as Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Joe Lengyel. Joe knows what it means to serve, too. He’s logged over 3,000 hours behind the controls of an F-16. His 34 years of distinguished military service includes operational, staff and command assignments that included services in Desert Storm, Provide Comfort, Southern Watch, and Enduring Freedom among others. But perhaps most importantly, Joe knows what it means to be a military family. He knows the meaning of service, sacrifice, and separation. When Joe’s father, here present, Sir, Lieutenant Colonel Lauren Lengyel, was shot down over Vietnam in August of 1967 and held as a prisoner of war for six years, it fell to Joe’s mother Margaret to raise Joe, his sister Dottie, and his brothers Dan and Greg, who’s now, himself a Major General in the Air Force. The poet John Milton once wrote, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” Well, Joe’s entire family served through those long years of uncertainty and strain, and they continued to serve when Joe’s dad returned to service in Vietnam in 1975, one of only two former POW pilots to do so. Joe’s parents are here today, as you all know, as is his brother, and I want to take a moment to thank them for their service and sacrifice. We pray that no military family ever has to go through Joe’s experience growing up again, but we know that every deployment, every separation is a strain. And I’m confident that Joe will continue the good work Frank has done in strengthening community and employer support for our warriors, and particularly for our military families before, during and after deployments. Our greatest resource is our people, and there’s no finer example than Joe’s family. Today we’re joined by his wife Sally – Sally, welcome aboard…you’ve been aboard for a while, but you’re stepping up here – an Air Force veteran herself, his daughter Katie, and sons Joe and Mike, who, like his father, is an F-16 pilot. I know that the men and women of our National Guard, and the families that stand by them, will be well served by General Joe Lengyel who is not only an accomplished pilot and experienced commander, but is also a military son, husband, brother and a father. Now, it’s a big world out there, and we are a great nation, with extraordinary responsibilities, opportunities, and challenges around the world and around the block. We cannot predict how, or when, or where, the men and women of our National Guard will be called on to serve their fellow citizens. But we know that thanks to the strong and steady leadership of General Frank Grass, the National Guard of today is an indispensable force, trained and ready to respond wherever it’s needed.  And we know that General Lengyel will lead this force with certainty, clarity, and the full confidence and trust of myself and the President. To General Lengyel, to General Grass, and to all the men and women of the National Guard, thank you for everything you do, and for always remaining, “Always Ready, Always There.” ",Remarks at the National Guard Bureau Change of Responsibility ,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/901580/remarks-at-the-national-guard-bureau-change-of-responsibility/
"Nov. 24, 2014","To the men and women of the Department of Defense: I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know that this morning, President Obama accepted my letter of resignation. I have agreed to continue to serve as Secretary of Defense until my successor is confirmed by the United States Senate. You should know I did not make this decision lightly. But after much discussion, the President and I agreed that now was the right time for new leadership here at the Pentagon. I want you to know that I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished together. We have prepared ourselves, our Allies and the Afghan National Security Forces for a successful transition in Afghanistan. We have taken the fight to ISIL and, with our Iraqi and coalition partners, have blunted the momentum of this barbaric enemy. We have come to the aid of millions of people around the world who have suffered the ravages of natural disaster and of disease. We have worked tirelessly to sustain our all-volunteer force that has given so much during 13 years of war. And we have bolstered enduring alliances and strengthened emerging partnerships, all the while setting in motion important reforms that will prepare this institution for the challenges facing us in the decades to come. Most importantly, we have helped keep this country and our fellow citizens safe. We have sustained the blessings of liberty our ancestors secured and upheld the oath we took. That work will continue. It must continue. The world is still too dangerous, the threats too numerous, for us to lose focus. And even as I promised the President my full support going forward, so, too, do I promise that I will work hard to support you right up until my last day in office. I owe you that. There will be time later to say farewell. For now, please know how much I respect and admire your service and that of your families. As I gather with my own family this Thanksgiving holiday -- a luxury I realize not all of you will enjoy -- it will be the privilege of having worked with you these last two years for which I will be most grateful. Thank you for all you do for this country. God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving. ",Statement to the Force,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606637/statement-to-the-force/
"Jan. 11, 2017","Good morning, everyone. Well, in 1981, a recent Master’s graduate traveled to Washington to apply for the dream job she’d been working toward for years – a position with the U.S. Foreign Service.  But this aspiring diplomat’s so-called “Plan A” didn’t work out: the Department of State had no positions. Thankfully this bright young graduate remained committed to serving her country – and the Defense Department was hiring.  So she decided to go with her “Plan B,” a position with the Department of the Army.  That job launched a career in national security that led her to Capitol Hill, the defense industry, and back to the Pentagon. So General Goldfein, Members of Congress, Frank, DoD colleagues past and present: the State Department’s loss was our gain, because today, we’re here to celebrate Debbie James’s leadership as our 23rd Secretary of the Air Force – the pinnacle of a remarkable three-decade-long career safeguarding our nation’s defense. I want to especially welcome Debbie’s family – her husband Frank and her children Sam, Regina, and Michelle.  Thanks for the support you’ve provided her throughout her career – I know how much love and support you’ve given her; and I know you must be proud, as we are, of everything she’s accomplished. As Secretary, Debbie ensured that the Air Force continued to soar to new heights in defense of our great nation – sustaining the excellence we’ve come to expect over more than seven decades.  She led the organizing, training, and equipping of the more than 600,000 men and women in the United States Air Force – active-duty, Air National Guard, and reserve – always putting them, our people, first. And those airmen are out here right now, confronting no fewer than five immediate, evolving challenges around the world.  They’ve conducted over two-thirds of our coalition’s airstrikes against ISIL, enabling our partners to take back critical territory in Iraq and Syria, show that there cannot be an Islamic State based upon this ideology, dealing ISIL the lasting defeat that it deserves and will receive.  They’re basing advanced assets and maintaining continuous bomber presence in the Asia-Pacific – the single region of the world most consequential region to our nation’s future – to safeguard allies and partners and to deter continued North Korean aggression.  In the face of Iran’s malign influence in the Gulf, they’re working closely with our partners to strengthen integrated air and missile defense capabilities across the region, prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and maintain a strong and credible deterrent capability in the region.  And they’re playing a vital role in deterring Russian aggression in Europe – supporting our NATO allies, deploying F-22s, and spearheading a persistent and dominant air presence in the region. In addition to these five challenges, our airmen have also continued to flawlessly execute the Air Force’s core missions around the world.  They maintain U.S. air and space superiority – ensuring that our military can operate and project power everywhere in the world.  They conduct countless ISR missions all over the world while maintaining the ability to rapidly mobilize to anywhere they’re called.  And they operate the capabilities that provide both global strike and command and control – critical elements of our nuclear deterrence. Of course, even as we meet these current challenges, Secretary James knows – and has helped us all and everyone in the Air Force remember – that we must find what she’s called, quote, “the right balance between preserving the Air Force of today and building toward the Air Force of tomorrow.” Despite increasing optempo, Debbie always focused on readiness and growing the force to make sure our airmen can not only meet today’s challenges, but also address those that we may confront in the uncertain future.  To stay ahead and to maintain U.S. air superiority in the face of 21st century threats, she helped the Air Force advance key capabilities like the F-35 stealth fighter, the B-21 long-range strike bomber, and the KC-46 tanker, as well as innovative programs like the arsenal plane and swarming 3D-printed microdrones. Recognizing that nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our security, Debbie also demonstrated a strong commitment to sustaining that deterrence by reversing decades of underinvestment in the nuclear enterprise – not only to address troubling issues that had arisen over the years, but also to recapitalize both of the Air Force’s two legs of our nuclear triad: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers. Debbie’s leadership in this regard is truly a hallmark of her tenure, and it’s critically important.  In fact, she visited our Air Force’s nuclear bases on her first trip as Secretary, and she returned to Minot and Malmstrom on her final trip just last week.  There, she ran focus groups with nuclear force airmen – something she’s been doing since the beginning of her tenure – to learn how our policies are affecting them.  With these conversations, Secretary James has established an important feedback loop between airmen and senior leadership, and she’ll pass along the lessons learned from these conversations to her successor. In addition to all this, Secretary James has also helped sustain our deterrence, and much more, by investing in space – a domain that’s woven into every aspect of our military operations today, conventional and nuclear alike.  To prepare for the future, Debbie has also been a key leader in making certain DoD is ready to deter and defend against attacks in space by making serious investments in the capabilities that enhance our ability to identify, to attribute, and to negate threatening actions by others in space.  And as the principal DoD space advisor, and the person upon whom I and the President have relied, Debbie has helped incorporate space, integrate space into our core contingency plans, and made sure our space capabilities are as resilient and assured as our nuclear capabilities – all the more important given that we now view space as a potential warfighting domain. Now, of course, over the years, Secretary James has focused on the strength of the force – Debbie never lost sight of what that greatest strength is, our people.  She always put the men and women of the Air Force first, saying, “we’re going to take care of you and your families so that you in turn can take care of [all of] us.” And throughout her tenure, it’s clear that Debbie always takes care of America’s airmen first.  We see that in her advocacy for more resources to help our men and women carry out their missions.  We see it in the Get-Well Plan she established for the Air Force’s fleet of remotely-piloted aircraft, and in her dedication to supporting our nuclear force personnel – ensuring that they have the opportunities to advance and succeed in their careers.  And we also see it in her commitment to ridding the ranks of sexual assault, in particular by focusing on preventing these terrible offenses against honor and trust, which are the foundations of the profession of arms, from happening in the first place. But Secretary James’s commitment to airmen extends beyond taking care of the force we have today.  She’s also been a wonderful partner in laying the groundwork for the Air Force, and the joint force, of the future – helping ensure that our military remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  Debbie has worked tirelessly to foster a long-term commitment to diversity and inclusion in the Air Force – rightly noting that, quote, “diversity of background, experience, and skill are paramount when it comes to innovation and [the] capability to perform.” And she’s taken a hands-on approach through mentorship and running a Lean In Circle.  Through her leadership, she’s fostered a commitment to developing the talents of the next generation of airmen – making sure that our Air Force will have not only the capabilities it needs, but also the leaders it needs to execute its core missions with excellence long into the future. As we honor all of Secretary James’ contributions to this department and our country this morning, I know I speak on behalf of everyone here – and not only the entire Air Force, but also the entire Department of Defense – when I say to you, Debbie, that your “Plan B” worked out awfully well for the country and the department. And Deb, I’ve got to say on a personal note, our friendship, and my admiration for you, go back many years.  I’ve been especially fortunate, though, in the last few years as Secretary of Defense, to have you as my trusted and unfailingly effective partner in strengthening and applying the Air Force.  Thanks, pal. Because of your leadership, the United States Air Force is better prepared to fly, fight, and win than at any time in history.  Across the many missions we ask our Air Force to complete, across the many domains we ask them to dominate, the foundations of this proud service are stronger than ever.  Thank you, Debbie James, for your service to this country, for your commitment to our airmen, to their families, and to the joint force.  We’re safer today because of you.

"March 30, 2016","Good morning.  Ladies and gentlemen, elected officials, members of the SOCOM team, the broader DOD team, friends and family, privileged to be here today to honor two great Americans and their families. For both Joe Votel and newly promoted General Tony Thomas, their families have been a vital foundation, providing them the flexibility to answer their country's call repeatedly and to lead missions of incredible difficulty.  To Joe's two sons, Scott and Nicholas, and especially his wife Michelle, you've supported Joe at every stop in his distinguished career.  With a generosity of spirit and a warm heart, you've welcomed so many of Joe's troops and their families into the SOCOM team.  As Joe has repeatedly taken charge of no-fail missions, your support has sustained him. Few understand better how Joe's family has served beside him than the Thomas family, and Tony's wife, Barbara, and sons Mike and Tony.  They've been just as steadfast in their support.  In General Thomas' family, we also see the continuation of a proud legacy. Indeed, there can be fewer greater honors or indications of his personal success than the decision of Tony's sons, Mike and Tony, to serve in our military.  So it's a privilege to speak before these two families, but also before this greater SOCOM community, before a community of men and women whose constant readiness and unparalleled excellence provides our nation a critical advantage over every adversary. It's an essential soft truth that while special operators can be rapidly deployed, they can't be rapidly developed.  The abilities of our special operators and the support they provide our total force are the product of years of arduous training and constant preparation.  And when your capabilities are called upon, we never forget the risks and the sacrifices you take on. So even as we enjoy the Florida sunshine and mark this important occasion, we know that in places we rarely speak about, in operations the world may never know about, special operators are executing critical missions, carrying out their orders, protecting their teammates, safeguarding us all.  And as secretary of Defense, you have my solemn commitment to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Special Forces operations, to defend the tradition you carry forward as men and women committing to maintaining your anonymity as you defend our country so nobly. And in a year when threats can emerge from nearly anywhere on Earth and when greater destructive power risks are falling into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, the citizens of this great country will continue to depend on your constant pursuit of excellence. Today, in more than 80 nations across the world, men and women of SOCOM are answering our nation's call, strengthening partnerships, providing training and assistance to friendly local forces, keeping a watchful eye on emerging threats, prosecuting targets with precision and finality. Over the past 19 months, you have accomplished all of this under the distinguished command of one of our most accomplished warriors, Joe Votel, whom we honor today with not one, but two ceremonies.  I recommended General Votel to President Obama to lead CENTCOM for three central reasons, reasons that are plainly evident when you look at his extraordinary leadership at SOCOM. First, Joe has extensive experience with all elements of the Joint Force:  air, sea, ground, core special operations, but also cyber, space.  And this joint experience and, importantly, transregional experience, has provided him the perspective and authority to lead the enormous and varied force American brings to bear in the CENTCOM AOR. Within SOCOM itself is clear and creative problem-solving, from personnel and leadership issues to acquisitions, and of course, operations, is something I have come to consult as I approach broader challenges of DOD. And second, General Votel has extensive experience and deep understanding of CENTCOM's Area of Responsibility.  Joe's insights, historical knowledge and strategic perspective have helped us shape our approach to our interests in this complex region. And third, this last talent is also why he's the perfect fit to lead CENTCOM, his politico-military skill and strength as a warrior diplomat.  We have important partners and allies in the region, including Israel.  A critical part of our approach to defending ourselves and our interests is to work with partner security forces in our strategic approach to a lasting defeat of ISIL, to our continued support of Afghanistan, to continuing to counter Iran's malign influence.  For these complex strategic situations, Joe Votel has it all. Of course, the great majority of Joe's successes will stay classified, but this we do know, time and time again, Joe has asked difficult questions and demanded that we develop better solutions for our people.  So it's clear that General Votel leaves some big boots to fill.  And it's just as clear that there's nobody more capable or trusted to fill them than the man they call T2, Tony Thomas. Tony describes himself, and I'm from Philly too, as Philadelphia fast, and it's true.  He gets to the point quickly, gets to the point candidly and he's also the original Philadelphia flyer.  There are soldiers 10 to 20 years his junior who would think twice about trying to keep up with Tony in a five miler and some might struggle to keep the pace and others keep up with a conversation.  By the end of the run, they'd all have a couple life lessons or book recommendations. There's one book Tony often recommends by Steven Pressfield called the Gates of Fire.  Well, the story it tells is about Thermopylae's defense 2500 years ago.  The warrior ethos is captures has clear echoes in SOCOM's work today.  As one soldier declares before a critical fight, and I quote, ""This is my shield, I bear it before me in battle.  But it's not mine alone.  It protects my brother and my city.  I will never let my brother out of its shadow, nor my people out of its shelter."" Tony Thomas has lived this commitment like few warriors in his generation.  He's led many of our most elite war fighters through the gates of fire and has helped our partner forces to escape them.  On so many days and so many missions, Tony's leadership has provided shelter for the people of this country. Soldiers under Tony's command were some of the first to enter Afghanistan in the weeks after September 11, 2001.  They arrived at what's now Bagram Air Base where, at the time, rusted hulks of Soviet airplanes served as their cover.  While his troops were eager to join the fight immediately, Tony stressed the need for constant preparation.  Knowing their test would come, Tony replicated the rigors of combat through rigorous live fire exercises.  As the saying goes, steel sharpens steel.  Tony clearly understood that a warrior must constantly challenge himself to be ready, and his focus on real-life training quickly had real impacts on countless soldiers and their families. In March of 2002, U.S. special operators arrived at Takur Ghar, the strategic mountain top in Southeastern Afghanistan to find an entrenched rear guard of Al Qaida fighters.  After coming under a withering assault and enduring a prolonged firefight, our forces took several casualties, found themselves isolated. Tony's Rangers would receive an order to launch a no notice mission to recover heroic Navy SEAL and reinforce U.S. forces.  After the initial shock of having their helicopter hit during landing, the rescue force held off a far larger number fighters for 14 hours while recovering the fallen SEAL.  Tony's men not only endured a ferocious assault in one of the most forbidding locations in the Hindu Kush, they accomplished their mission. While parts of this story have been told many times, in many ways, the scope and the scale of the bravery and heroism at Takur Ghar may only be fully known by those who were there.  We will never forget the seven courageous Americans who gave their last full measure of devotion on that Afghan peak. But we also know that there are many more brave Americans who will tell you this plainly; they are alive today because of Tony's men.  Because of their courage, because of their readiness to carry out the most complex and dangerous of missions.  Tony's one of our toughest battle tested leaders in Special Operations. He is also one of the few to cross and serve a critical command role for conventional forces.  And whether it's serving as deputy commander of the first armored division in Iraq or in Afghanistan for a decade, or during his most recent leadership of joint Special Operations command, Tony's never concerned himself with what patch the people under his command where under their uniform. His remarkable record of accomplishments speaks to a commitment far larger than to a single elite organization but to meeting a single, solemn obligation, which is to protect and to strengthen this nation.  The character, the vision and leadership of both Tony Thomas and Joe Votel has been tested over 15 years of war and proven over more than three decades of preparation. It is telling that these two soldiers both graduated from West Point in the spring of 1980 and that they became officers just weeks after U.S. Special Operations began a painful period of self-examination in the wake of Desert One. The relentless drive of these two leaders to excel, to adapt and to learn from the past: both from failures and successes, has helped U.S. Special Operations forces become the envy of the world.  So today, we honor true -- two true pioneers in our military.  Two officers who have been indispensable in making U.S. Special Operations and our entire force into a far more effective protector of our nation and our people. As we transfer leadership of this command between these two professionals, these two consummate warriors and two soldier statesmen, we also celebrate a certain continuity.  We know that the standard General Votel has set for this community to constantly learn, adapt and prepare for a world of diffuse threats will be carried forward under the command of Tony Thomas.  We know the people of SOCOM and the people of our nation will continue to grow stronger because of General Thomas' proven leadership. So General Thomas, General Votel, thank you both.  Bless your families.  Bless you all this audience.  Bless our great country and congratulations again guys.

"May 9, 2016","Good afternoon.  It’s a great privilege to welcome Dr. Kissinger to the Pentagon and to have so many long-time friends and dedicated public servants and DoD leaders with us today. Henry Kissinger is, of course, unique in the annals of American diplomacy and there is no need to explain the recognition of his achievements and his thoughts; although I will get to them later.  But, what might seem odd is that a Secretary of Defense is giving the Department of Defense’s highest award to a Secretary of State.  But I believe that this is deeply appropriate given what I also believe is so deeply valuable about the great institution that it is my privilege to lead. For our defense is so vital that we have to take the long view and how we shepherd it from strategic era to strategic era, from administration to administration, across parties, and across our government, including the State Department and the National Security Council, which Henry ran in his time. And defense requires a strategic perspective – and that requires that we understand our connections to the leaders and challenges of the past. Cultivating the strategic perspective Henry Kissinger personifies means keeping the world in synoptic view, seeing all of its parts and problems at once, and using the great physical and moral strength of the world’s greatest nation wisely, to protect our people and make a better world.  It means knowing which mix of the full range of foreign policy tools—including but not limited to the finest fighting force the world has ever known—is best for a given situation. It means understanding where our challenges today fall in the broad arc of history, and how we can use history’s lessons to pursue today’s opportunities.  And it means keeping ever-grounded in our national security interests … they’re our North Star whether in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, or elsewhere. This perspective and this complexity is something we contend with every day at the Department of Defense, as we face today no fewer than five major, immediate, and evolving challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it’s metastasizing around the world. While we do not have the luxury of choosing among these challenges, we do have the ability to set a strategic course for the future: a future that’s uncertain but will surely demand America’s leadership, values, and military strength. And while our strategic objectives must be clearly framed, they must also be pursued across the whole of government and with the support of every government agency and every instrument of American power. And although the terms “whole-of-government” and “smart power,” are relatively new, the basic concept isn’t.  As Henry Kissinger knows full well and has written, these terms have been applied from Ancient China to the Holy Roman Empire to early modern Europe to the 19th century, to the 20th century and today. The idea of leveraging all resources of state is an enduring principle of strategy and statecraft. Battle-tested soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines have come to see that, in virtually any context, ensuring victory requires much more than guns.  In conflict zones, it requires good governance, reconciliation, education, and the rule of law and so on.  Marrying the threat of force with economic and diplomatic leverage is also essential in addressing a whole catalogue of strategic challenges. One, for example, in the current day upon which Henry, himself, has written is the need and the strategy to defeat ISIL.  And we will defeat ISIL – as I have said, ISIL’s defeat is certain, but it must also be lasting.  That will require DOD’s continued close work with the State Department to support the Government of Iraq.  It will require us to continue working with our State counterparts to galvanize financial support and accelerate the activities of our Coalition partners.  It will require Treasury to continue putting a squeeze on ISIL’s finances, and Homeland Security, the intelligence community, and law enforcement work together to prevent attacks on our homeland. While the physical defeat of ISIL will make more headlines, we are also mustering integrated efforts to secure cyberspace. It’s an area where the Department of Commerce is playing a critical role in setting standards.  And for our part, we at DoD have stood up Cyber Command, but this is an enterprise supported by the National Security Agency and the rest of the Intelligence Community and in close collaboration with Homeland Security.  At the same time, the State Department continues to push forward tentative efforts to achieve international agreements to apply a rule-based-order to behavior in cyberspace. As Dr. Henry Kissinger himself has emphasized, the potential dangers in cyberspace—and of technologies that have outstripped doctrines and strategies to counter them—present real dangers to global order and stability—this from him at 90 years old and despite living long before the Internet was imagined!  Dr. Kissinger has so often been prescient in spotting dangers on the strategic horizon, I am pleased that our efforts to respond to these challenges have become an integral part of our defense mission, and increasingly, of our work across the government. Now, Henry Kissinger continues to deliver insights of incomparable strategic value to our nation and defense mission, and most encouragingly, he shows no signs of slowing down.  While his contributions are far from complete, we are now beginning to appreciate what his service has provided our country, and how it has changed the way we think about strategy, and how he has helped provide greater security for our citizens and people around the world. Whether in securing SALT I, or in opening up diplomatic relations with China, and, really more than that—putting strategic framework beneath them decades ago or in seeking to bring an end to the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger has demonstrated to each of us how serious strategic thinking and perspective can deliver pragmatic solutions to seemingly intractable problems. I’m reminded of how President Nixon responded to Secretary Kissinger when he informed him that he was resigning from his tenured position at Harvard and committed to serving for the long haul.  In a polite and personal letter, the President responded, quote: “Frankly, I cannot imagine what the government would be like without you,” unquote. When we take into account the vast expanse of Henry Kissinger’s contributions to our country and the way we conceive of our security in today’s world; when we consider what he has done to prepare the United States for a period global competition, and global interaction, we, too, can’t imagine a world, a government, without Henry Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger, Henry, it is difficult to imagine our nation’s role in the world, and continued global leadership, without the strategic insights you have brought to your service across different administrations, Republican and Democrat, across different strategic eras, and across a period of more than six decades where you have shaped the debate on every defense and national security issue of consequence.  On behalf of this Department, and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you. It’s now my great honor to grant you the Department of Defense highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award.

"Oct. 13, 2014","Thank you, Minister Cateriano, for hosting this gathering and welcoming us to Arequipa.  Since this forum was established more than two decades ago, it has served as an important venue for discussing major challenges facing our region, and finding ways to strengthen our defense cooperation. I am here today to underscore the United States’ commitment to partnering with the Americas…to maintain peace and stability in our hemisphere, and to help build global security. As you all know, in the Western Hemisphere today, the most pressing security challenges – from organized crime to ungoverned spaces – do not respect national borders.  Nor do their consequences, such as the migration of unaccompanied minors. No nation can address these challenges alone.  We must work together to confront them. That is why it is welcome news that many nations in the region are becoming exporters of security – working with neighboring countries to provide training, build capacity, and address urgent security needs. Colombia, for example, has trained thousands of security forces from over a dozen countries in the region, building on the success of their National Training Center in Tolemaida, which I visited last week. Chile, where I was yesterday, has included Salvadoran, Ecuadorian, and Honduran units into its peacekeeping battalion that is supporting the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti. And two months ago, the United States was proud to join with Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Paraguay for the Partnership of the Americas exercise, which helps build our combined capability to execute peace support operations, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief missions. The United States remains committed to partnerships that strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of defense institutions, and enhance our ability to operate together. Our hemisphere’s multilateral defense institutions, and the Inter-American Defense System, are critical for this kind of collaboration.  I realize that not all countries are completely satisfied with this system, but the United States encourages your active engagement.  We need a more integrated, not a more fractured, architecture of cooperation…because the challenges we face span our entire hemisphere. The Security Implications of Climate Change Today, this region has become one of the most stable in the world.  In many nations of the hemisphere, economies are growing and democracy is flourishing. But we must be ready to confront emerging and future challenges to ensure this progress marches on. One of those emerging challenges, environmental security, is a major theme of this week’s conference, and it provides us with an opportunity to discuss the security implications of climate change. Climate change is a “threat multiplier”…because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we already confront today – from infectious disease to armed insurgencies – and to produce new challenges in the future. The loss of glaciers will strain water supplies in several areas of our hemisphere.  Destruction and devastation from hurricanes can sow the seeds for instability.  Droughts and crop failures can leave millions of people without any lifeline, and trigger waves of mass migration. We have already seen these events unfold in other regions of the world, and there are worrying signs that climate change will create serious risks to stability in our own hemisphere.  Two of the worst droughts in the Americas have occurred in the past ten years…droughts that used to occur once a century. In the Caribbean, sea level rise may claim 1,200 square miles of coastal land in the next 50 years, and some islands may have to be completely evacuated.  According to some estimates, rising temperatures could melt entire glaciers in the Andes, which could have cascading economic and security consequences. These climate trends will clearly have implications for our militaries.  A higher tempo and intensity of natural disasters could demand more support for our civil authorities, and more humanitarian assistance and relief.  Our coastal installations could be vulnerable to rising shorelines and flooding, and extreme weather could impair our training ranges, supply chains, and critical equipment.  Our militaries’ readiness could be tested, and our capabilities could be stressed. DoD’s Plan to Address Climate Change Risks The U.S. Department of Defense takes these risks very seriously, and that is why today we are launching a new Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap.  Building on one of the main themes of this year’s CDMA, this roadmap lays out our plan for confronting the challenges posed by climate change. This roadmap shows how we are identifying, with tangible and specific metrics, and using the best available science, the effects of climate change on the Department’s missions and responsibilities.  We have nearly completed a baseline survey to assess the vulnerability of our military’s more than 7,000 bases, installations, and other facilities. Drawing on these assessments, we will integrate climate change considerations into our planning, operations, and training.  Last year, for example, I released the Department of Defense’s Arctic Strategy, which addresses the potential security implications of rapidly melting Arctic ice. Working With Regional Partners on Climate Change To address the risks posed by climate change, we will work with partner nations, bilaterally and through organizations such as the Inter-American Defense Board and the CDMA.  We will share our findings, our tools for assessment, and our plans for resiliency.  We will also seek to learn from partner nations’ experiences as well. The U.S. military has already completed a joint assessment with its counterparts in Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Trinidad and Tobago on the defense implications of climate change.  I welcome the recent decision by the Inter-American Defense Board to accept this report for further study, and encourage using that forum to broaden our nations’ collaboration.  I also encourage our Armed Services’ Conferences in the hemisphere to explore the security implications of climate change.  And I invite more nations to participate in our Defense Environmental International Cooperation program. I recognize that our militaries play different roles and have different responsibilities in each of our nations.  I also recognize that climate change will have different impacts in different parts of the hemisphere.  But there are many opportunities to work together. In two months, the United Nations will convene countries from around the world here in Peru to discuss climate change.  Defense leaders must be part of this global discussion.  We must be clear-eyed about the security threats presented by climate change, and we must be pro-active in addressing them. I am confident that, in partnership, we can tackle the wide spectrum of challenges facing our hemisphere.  Working together, we can ensure that this region becomes even more peaceful, prosperous, and free in the years ahead. Thank you. ",Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/605617/conference-of-defense-ministers-of-the-americas/
"April 5, 2016","Thank you, thanks very much, John, for that warm introduction, but more importantly, for many, many years of friendship, of guidance, and wonderful service to our country over so many years – not to mention your leadership of this institution. It is a pleasure to be at CSIS this afternoon.  Since it was founded over 50 years ago, the Center for Strategic and International Studies has come to be considered one of the preeminent security-focused think tanks here in our nation’s capital.  You provide important ideas and scholarship on pressing issues ranging from matters of defense strategy and budget, to America’s strategic future in the Asia-Pacific, to the growing threats we face in the domain of cyberspace, to reviewing the Goldwater-Nichols Act that makes up much of DoD’s institutional organization.  And it’s because of that last piece of scholarship that I wanted to come here today. As many of you know, I recently issued my posture statement for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2017 – the first to describe how we’re approaching five strategic challenges: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism.  It is in this context that I want to speak to you today about some key long-term strategic management questions that DoD will be detailing and discussing with congressional defense committees in the very next coming weeks. As a learning organization, the U.S. military and the Defense Department has a long history of striving to reform our command structures and improve how our strategies and policies are formulated, integrated, and implemented.  Indeed, even while World War II was still being fought and before the Defense Department was even established, military leaders and policymaking officials were discussing how the military services could be unified, and exploring ways to develop stronger policy processes and advice.  The result was the National Security Act of 1947 and its amendments, which, among other historic changes, established the position of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council.  Later reforms, particularly Eisenhower-era changes, helped strengthen the offices of the Defense Secretary and gave new authorities to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But it was the Goldwater-Nichols Act, enacted 30 years ago this fall, that’s most responsible for today’s military and defense institutional organization.  With memories of Vietnam and the tragic Desert One raid still fresh, officials in defense and policymakers again considered reform.  And after nearly four years of work – not to mention some strong opinions by my former boss, then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger – the resulting transformation was what we now refer to as Goldwater-Nichols.  It solidified the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the Combatant Commanders.  It affirmed civilian control of the military by codifying in law that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is outside the chain of command, in order for him to be able to provide vital, objective, independent military advice to the Defense Secretary and the President.  At the same time, it also strengthened the Chairman’s role, created the position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and centralized the role and voice of the Combatant Commands.  And it reinforced the concept of jointness, especially with respect to the careers of senior officers, by requiring them to gain professional experience outside of their service in order to advance further in their careers.  All senior officers know these policies today, for they are integral to career advancement and achievement, and they reflect the reality of how our servicemembers train and fight every day as a joint force. Now, right around this time, albeit unrelated to Goldwater-Nichols, important changes were made to reform defense acquisition.  These were based on the recommendations of the Packard Commission, led by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Dave Packard.  As it happens, implementing the Packard Commission’s recommendations was another one of the first challenges I worked on early in my own career. As a whole, all these changes were overwhelmingly beneficial – a credit to the work of not only the members of Congress who passed the legislation, but also their staffs, John Hamre being one among them, I should say.  What they put into law has given us generations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who’ve grown accustomed to operating together as a joint force – overcoming many inter-service frictions of decades before.  And it’s enabled our nation to draw greater benefit from the advice of many valued Chairmen – from General Colin Powell during Operation Desert Storm, to General Joe Dunford today. This year, as Goldwater-Nichols turns 30, we can see that the world has changed since then – instead of the Cold War and one clear threat, we face a security environment that’s dramatically different from the last quarter-century.  It’s time that we consider practical updates to this critical organizational framework, while still preserving its spirit and intent.  For example, we can see in some areas how the pendulum between service equities and jointness may have swung too far, as in not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability; or where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, as in taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman and the Joint Chiefs to support force management, planning, and execution across the combatant commands, particularly in the face of threats that cut across regional and functional combatant command areas of responsibility, as many increasingly do. With this in mind, last fall I asked DoD’s Deputy Chief Management Officer, Peter Levine, and Lieutenant General Tom Waldhauser of the Joint Staff, to lead a comprehensive, department-wide review of these kinds of organizational issues – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, and the military departments – to identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of possible improvement.  And I’d like to discuss that review’s preliminary recommendations with you today. Over the coming weeks, we will execute some of these decisions under our own existing authority.  For others, where legislation is needed, we will work with the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on implementation as they consider this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.  Of course, both Committees have their own important reviews of this issue underway as well – making this area ripe for working together, something I’m pleased to report we’ve been doing effectively, and will continue to do on this topic.  I applaud Chairman McCain, Senator Reed, Chairman Thornberry – each of whom I was able to speak to earlier this morning – and also Congressman Smith.  And I look forward to continuing to work closely with all of them and their committees.  Because when it comes to these fundamental matters of our national security, that’s what we have to do – work together. Now, let me begin with transregional and transfunctional integration and advice – an imperative considering that the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  Our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat is one example; as we and our coalition partners have taken the fight to ISIL both in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and where it’s metastasizing, our combatant commanders from Central Command, European Command, Africa Command, and Special Operations Command have had to coordinate efforts more than ever before.  Increasingly, I’ve also brought Strategic Command and Cyber Command into these operations as well, to leverage their unique capabilities in space and cyber to contribute to the defeat of ISIL.  Beyond terrorism, we also face potential future nation-state adversaries with widening geographic reach, but also widening exposure – something we may want to take into account in order to de-escalate a crisis and deter aggression.  And in other cases, we may have to respond to multiple threats across the globe in overlapping time frames. In an increasingly complex security environment like this, and with a decision chain that cuts across the combatant commands only at the level of the Secretary of Defense, we’re not postured to be as agile as we could be.  Accordingly, we need to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, and in some cases the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Staff, in three ways: one, to help synchronize resources globally for daily operations around the world, enhancing our flexibility, and my ability, to move forces rapidly across the seams between our combatant commands; two, to provide objective military advice for ongoing operations, not just future planning; and three, to advise the Secretary of Defense on military strategy and operational plans, for example, helping ensure that our plans take into account in a deliberate fashion the possibility of overlapping contingencies. These changes recognize that in today’s complex world, we need someone in uniform who can look across the services and combatant commands and make objective recommendations to the department’s civilian leadership about where to allocate forces throughout the world and where to apportion risk to achieve maximum benefit for our nation.  And the person best postured to do that is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  We will pursue these changes in line with Goldwater-Nichols’s original intent, which is to enable the military to better operate in a seamless way, while still preserving both civilian control and the Chairman’s independence to provide professional military advice outside of the chain of command. Some have recommended the opposite course – to put the Chairman into the chain of command – but both Chairman Dunford and I agree that would erode the Chairman’s objectivity as the principal military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense.  And we appreciate that CSIS reached the same conclusion in its own review of Goldwater-Nichols. The second area where we need to make updates is in our combatant commands – adapting them to new functions, and continuing to aggressively streamline headquarters. Adapting to new functions will include changes in how we manage ourselves in cyberspace, in accordance with the emphasis I placed on cyber in my posture statement, and that the President made in his fiscal year 2017 budget.  There, I made clear that in each of the five challenges facing DoD, we must deal with them across all domains – not just the traditional air, land, sea, and space, but also cyberspace, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also some vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit.  That’s why our budget increases cyber investments to a total of $35 billion over the next five years, and why we should consider changes to cyber’s role in DoD’s Unified Command Plan. As some of you may know, DoD is currently in the process of reducing our management headquarters by 25 percent – a needed step – and we’re on the road to accomplish that goal thanks to the partnership of the congressional defense committees, which once again we deeply appreciate.  We can meet these targets without combining Northern Command and Southern Command, or combining European Command and Africa Command – actions that would run contrary to why we made them separate, because of their distinct areas of emphasis and increasing demands on our forces in them.  And indeed those demands have only further increased in recent years, with each command growing busier.  So instead of combining these commands to the detriment of our friends, our allies, and in fact our own command and control capabilities, we intend to be more efficient by integrating functions like logistics, intelligence, and plans across the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and subordinate commands, eliminating redundancies while not losing capability, and much can be done here. Additionally, in the coming weeks the Defense Department will look to simplify and improve command and control where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy, or less efficient than they could be.  The military is based on rank hierarchy, where juniors are subordinate in rank to their seniors; this is true from the platoon to the corps level, but it gets complicated at some of our combatant and component command headquarters, where we have a deep bench of extremely talented senior leaders.  So where we see potential to be more efficient and effective, billets currently filled by four-star generals and admirals will be filled by three-stars in the future. The next area I want to discuss today is acquisition.  Thirty years after the Packard Commission’s recommendations led to the establishment of an undersecretary of defense for acquisition, service acquisition executives, and the roles of program executive officers and program managers, it’s clear we still can and must do more to deliver better military capability while making better use of the taxpayers’ dollars. Six years ago when I was Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, DoD began what I called the Better Buying Power, an initiative to continuously improve our acquisition system.  And under the current Undersecretary, Frank Kendall, we’re now on the third iteration, Better Buying Power 3.0.  And while we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time, there’s still a constant need for improvement – particularly as technology, industry, and our own missions continue to change. One way we’re improving is by involving the service chiefs more in acquisition decision-making and accountability, consistent with legislation Congress passed last year – including giving them a seat on the Defense Acquisition Board, and giving them greater authority at what’s known as “Milestone B,” where engineering and manufacturing development begins; that is, where programs are first defined and a commitment to fund them is made.  As I’ve discussed with the service chiefs, with this greater responsibility comes greater accountability – the chiefs themselves, and their military staffs, will need to sharpen this skillset, which in places has atrophied over the years, to be successful in discharging their new acquisition responsibilities.  And I also expect them to leverage the many lessons they’ve learned over the last 15 years as operators – many of them in war, where speed and agility are crucial – to help our acquisition professionals deliver even better capabilities to our warfighters. Another way we’ll seek to improve is by streamlining the acquisition system itself.  This will include evaluating and where appropriate reducing other members of the Defense Acquisition Board – it’s currently composed of about 35 principals and advisors, each of whom is likely to feel empowered as a gatekeeper for acquisition; reducing these layers will both free up staff time and focus decision-making energy on overcoming real obstacles to program success rather than bureaucratic hurdles.  And we also intend to reduce burdensome acquisition documentation – just for one example, in cases where the defense acquisition executive serves as the milestone decision authority, the current process dictates that 14 separate documents be coordinated within the department.  Reducing these paperwork requirements in a meaningful way, and pushing approval authority lower down when a program is on the right track, will eliminate redundant reviews and shorten review timelines – ultimately getting capabilities fielded to our troops sooner, which our service chiefs and our combatant commanders desire and deserve. The last major area where we need to update Goldwater-Nichols is in making changes to joint personnel management as part of what I call the Force of the Future – an endeavor I began last year to ensure that our future all-volunteer force will be just as fine as the one I have the privilege of leading today, even as generations change and job markets change.  We’ve taken several steps already – building on-ramps and off-ramps so technical talent can more easily flow between DoD and America’s great innovative communities; opening all combat positions to women who meet service standards to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force; and doing more to support military families to improve retention, like extending maternity and paternity leave, and giving families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional commitments. Now, one of the hallmarks of Goldwater-Nichols is that it made joint duty required for all officers who wanted to rise to the highest levels of our military.  In so doing, it led to great advances in jointness across the military services – such that almost all our people know why, and how, we operate as a joint team – and it’s also significantly strengthened the ability of our Chairmen, our Joint Chiefs, and our Combatant Commanders to accomplish their joint responsibilities. As we’ve learned over the years what it takes to operate jointly, it’s become clear that we need to change the requirements for joint duty assignments, which are more narrow and rigid than they need to be.  Accordingly, we’re proposing to broaden the definition of positions for which an officer can receive joint duty credit, going beyond planning and command-and-control to include joint experience in other operational functions, such as intelligence, fires, transportation and maneuver, protection, and sustainment, including joint acquisition.  For example, while a staff officer in a combatant command would get joint duty credit, an officer in a combined air operations center coordinating with servicemembers in all different uniforms to call in airstrikes against ISIL might not.  In another case, take two cyber airmen working at a combatant command – one does cyber plans and gets joint credit, the other does cyber targeting and doesn’t.  And while a logistics planner at a combatant command doesn’t receive joint credit, their operational plans counterpart does.  So what we’re proposing will fix these discrepancies and fulfill the true purpose of Goldwater-Nichols, which was to ensure meaningful joint experience. Additionally, we’re also proposing to shorten the amount of time required to accumulate joint duty, from three years to two years, so top personnel have more flexibility to take on command assignments and other opportunities to broaden and deepen their careers. Now, going forward, it’s important to make all these updates under the guiding principle of ‘do no harm.’  Goldwater-Nichols took four years to write, and it’s been incredibly successful over three decades – to the credit of the reforms it put in place, we are not driven today by a signal failure like Desert One.  To the contrary – I’m deeply proud of how our people have operated in Iraq and Afghanistan over the 15 years.  So we come at this from a different direction, and the updates we make now must not undo the many positive benefits that Goldwater-Nichols has had for DoD.  Instead, they must build on them. Let me close today on why we’re doing this – why it’s important that we deal with all the pressing challenges and threats we have to deal with every day, and that as we do that we take a moment to address the topic of DoD’s organizational structure.  We do this because our servicemembers, and the nation they protect, deserve the best Defense Department and military we can give them – because they’re giving their best day in and day out, all around the globe. It’s our job here – on both sides of the river here in Washignton, and both sides of the aisle – to come together as Barry Goldwater and Sam Nunn did 30 years ago to give our men and women in uniform what they need to succeed: from the right experience, to the right capabilities, to the right leadership structure, to the right strategic thinking.  As long as we do, I’m confident that they will continue to excel in defending our great country and making a better future for our children. Thank you.

"May 3, 2016","Good morning, everyone. Just take a look out there, how magnificent you look. How proud we are of you. And ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies who are here, Chairman Dunford, members of the EUCOM and NATO team, friends, family, it's a privilege to be with you as we pass this vital command between two of our military's most distinguished and accomplished leaders: General Philip Breedlove, General Curtis Scaparrotti. I have plenty to say about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary generals.  Before I do, I want speak directly to you, the men and women of EUCOM, about the work you do every day and the challenges that we face together.  I'm proud of you for what you do to strengthen our partnerships with some of our most important allies and friends, and to confront a new generation of high-end threats to the security of this continent. You are doing the noblest thing that one can do, dedicating your lives to the security of your country, the security of others, making a better world for our children. And whether on the ground in the Balkans, or the skies over the Baltic, afloat on a Black Sea, helping deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, or enabling NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan.  You’re advancing a proud and distinguished tradition, here.  And working shoulder to shoulder with many of our oldest and closest friends, you are helping to strengthen one of history's strongest and most capable alliances. And for nearly seven decades, the guarantor of prosperity and stability on this continent has been the NATO alliance.  For generations, our member nations have stood for enduring principles, including the peaceful resolution of disputes, non-aggression and the spread of freedom and democracy.  We've helped ensure that countries can make their own security and economic choices, free from coercion or intimidation.  We've also help ensure that the door to the Euro-Atlantic integration remains open, so that countries that take on the challenge of building democratic institutions, making tough reforms, strengthening the rule of law also have a chance to join the Alliance. NATO has been so effective in doing so, because we share common values, reflected in the way we conduct ourselves.  We know what each other stands for, how we do things and why.  We treat each other as equals, and we take each other's interests into account.  It's clear that we do things better when we do them together. The strategic environment in Europe has changed dramatically to the end of World War II, to the end of the Cold War, to complex challenges Europe faces today from the east and the south.  This requires changing how we do things, even as we seek to protect and achieve what remains the same.  The 20th century NATO playbook that helped create a Europe whole, free and at peace was effective in its time.  But it's not a perfect match for the 21st-century challenges we face.  And that's why, under General Breedlove's leadership, NATO forces have been writing a new playbook.  They've been innovating to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, and adjusting our posture and presence so that we can be more agile in responding to new threats. We and our allies are working together to develop answers to important questions, like how can we keep our posture and region resilient and effective in the face of fast-moving, technological changes and challenges?  How can we better integrate and distribute our capabilities and maneuvers across functions and in every domain to deter, and if necessary, defend against a high end aggression?  How can we do more to train like we'd fight to stay prepared for even the most high threat scenarios?  And what's the best way to leverage our unique strengths and global influence in order to de-escalate a crisis? The NATO force that General Breedlove leaves behind is stronger than the one he inherited, as our allies recognized the need to continue investing and modernizing their capabilities, not only respond to current challenges, but stay ahead of potential, future threats.  Our nation's pledge to the 2014 Wales Summit, to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense and 20 percent on capital investments.  And I want to thank those nations that have met or will meet these critical benchmarks.  In our defense budgets, in our planning and in our capabilities and in our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we have the capabilities and capacity to ensure that they regret it, because for a force to deter a conflict, it must show that it can dominate a conflict. And we haven't had to prioritize deterrence on NATO's eastern flank for the past 25 years.  While I wish it were otherwise, now we have to.  Despite the progress that we've made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled, international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community and Russia itself so well for so long. Russia continues to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  At sea, in the air and space and cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises troubling questions about Russia's leader's commitments to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons. In response, the United States is taking a strong and balanced approach to address Russia's aggression.  We are strengthening our capabilities, our posture, our investments, our plans and our allies and partners, all without closing the door to working with Russia, where our interests align.  And we will continue to make clear that Russia's aggressive actions only serve to further its isolation and unite our alliance. Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, the United States has made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies.  For example, we're contributing to NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  Our recent budget submission builds on that significantly, investing in the work you do here at EUCOM in breaking new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterrence –  and if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future. To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia's aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative, making a total investment of $3.4 billion for this year, fiscal year 2017, which more than quadruples the amount we requested last year.  This will allow us to increase the amount of war fighting equipment, as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies. This increased support's heel-to-toe rotations that maintain the persistent presence of an armored brigade combat team, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European allies and friends.  It supports more war fighting gear, including forward stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017. It also supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such as this equipment – and along with assigned Army Airborne, and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, and Marine Corps. heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – all that will allow us to rapidly form a highly capable, combined armed grounds force of division plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C Tactical Fighter Squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft – all this to reinforce our enduring commitment to the security of our European partners. Our budget also reflects our doing more in more ways with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, it includes building towards a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap.  It's Norway's North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe's first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to our British allies.  And given Russia's use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – we're investing in more rotational presence of U.S. Special Operations Forces, exercising and training here in Europe. And as we look to address the threats of the future as well as today, we're making significant investment in important new technologies.  And when coupled with revised operational concepts, these technologies will ensure that we can deter, and if necessary, win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access area denial environment across all domains and war fighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-ranged anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers and new systems for electronic warfare, space and cyberspace.  Finally, our budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent.  With these commitments, we will continue to build on our capability to deter a potential adversary like Russia. But the United States will also continue to hold out the possibility that Russia will assume the role of a constructive partner moving forward, not isolated and going backward in time as it appears to be doing today.  Much of the progress we've made together since the end of the Cold War we accomplished with Russia.  Let me repeat that.  Not in spite of Russia, not against Russia, not without Russia, but with it.  Russia worked toward the future before.  I know that personally. For 1995, for example, I worked with the Russian minister of defense to create an agreement on how Russia could work with NATO in bringing peace to Bosnia.  I also worked in a very practical and successful manner with Russian defense officials to help limit the dangers of nuclear proliferation in the former Soviet space.  And more recently, as the logistician for the international effort in Afghanistan, I was the beneficiary of a Russia-hosted NATO supply route into Afghanistan.  So for the United States, as we stand strong with allies and friends, we'll also continue to reach out when and where our and Russia's interests align.  And Russia can perceive that as well, such as the recent nuclear agreement with Iran, the P5+1 talks on North Korea and some other issues. People in the United States, here in Europe, and it should be clear in Russia, have all benefited from those moments of collaboration and progress.  So, that's why we'll keep the door open for Russian, but it's up to the Kremlin to decide.  We don't seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don't seek to make Russia an enemy.  But make no mistake, we will defend our allies, the rule-based international order and the positive future it affords us. And you, the men and women of EUCOM, will continue to play a critical role during this period of challenge and change, answering our country's call to defend our interests, our allies, the principled global order and the positive future it affords us all.  And you've performed magnificently under the command of one of the principled and visionary leaders we celebrate today, General Philip Breedlove. It was my great honor as Deputy Secretary to preside over the ceremony right here in Stuttgart three years ago, when General Breedlove assumed responsibility for this critical command.  For my work with Phil during his time as Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, I had every confidence then that he was the right pick for the job. Now I need to tell you my favorite Phil Breedlove story.  And it goes like this – one day I was sitting in my office and my daughter called me from college, and she said, ""Hey, Dad, do you know General Phil Breedlove?""  I said, ""Yeah, honey, I do.""  And she said, ""Well, he just gave the most amazing talk on leadership to us here.""  I said, ""Well, I'm not surprised to hear that.""  And she said, ""Do you get to meet with General Breedlove?"" And I said, ""Well, you know, honey, if he has time for me, I get to meet with him."" I knew General Breedlove was a figure who would lead EUCOM with the highest standards of professionalism, and a leader who could adapt and respond and innovate and command effectively to a changing environment.  And certainly, much has changed since General Breedlove assumed command of EUCOM and became Supreme Allied Commander.  He has been the first to show the way to responding to that change.  But what hasn't changed is the nature of Phil's strong, and steady and principled leadership. During his tenure as EUCOM Commander, General Breedlove has drawn not only from all he has achieved as a senior officer, but from his years in Europe as a young American pilot.  From his service on this continent during some of those perilous days of the Cold War, he deeply appreciates how times of great challenge demand closer and stronger partnerships.  He knows what it means to prepare and train each day to fly, to fight and to win alongside NATO counterparts. And one of his most cherished memories over these past three years came during the 75th anniversary commemorations of D-Day, Carentan, a town in Normandy where allied forces established their first continuous line of defense.  The commemorations left a profound impression, especially as an American veteran of the invasion walked with General Breedlove for the final steps of the parade.  General Breedlove remarked that before that event he thought he had known – understood – the significance of D-Day.  But as he walked in the parade passing fields where so many have given their last full measure of devotion, and crossing the road now named Purple Heart Lane, he reflected upon what D-Day means to us as Americans and to our European brethren.  He said, ""We honor the sacrifices and memory of those who have gone before us, by recognizing how far we have come as a community and by continuing to move forward together, striving for a Europe, whole, free and at peace."" Phil, you not only honored that commitment, you've dedicated your life to carrying it forward.  But you and your wife Cindy, have been shining examples to our allies of all that is good and decent about the American military.  And Cindy, we are all grateful.  And that includes Stephanie and myself, for your tireless dedication to the welfare of our troops.  You and Phil are truly a wonderful team.  And for your selfless service and leadership, on behalf of the Department of Defense and a grateful nation, you too have our deepest appreciation.  Thank you. And as Phil and Cindy transition from this command, they can do so knowing that the men and women of EUCOM are in the good hand of another principled leader, who also had the good sense to marry a remarkable woman named Cindy. General Curtis Scaparrotti, or “SCAP” as we all know him.  I recommended Scap to the President for this critical command for three central reasons.  And he easily approved that recommendation for those same reasons. First, Scap has a proven track record to performance under pressure and in environments of significant complexity and uncertainty.  Whether leading troops in the Balkans during a contentious and fragile moment in history; or in Afghanistan, where he led ISAF's joint command and 140,000 NATO troops; or most recently, as Commander of Combined Forces Command on the Korean Peninsula – a place where ""fight tonight"" is not just a slogan, but an ever present possibility.  Scap knows the practicalities of land and joint combat.  He has been a tower of strength and deterrence, continually preparing his troops for evolving threats.  And I have no doubt these skills will serve him well here in this environment, where preparedness and adaptiveness are going to be so critical. Second, as his success with our Korean and Coalition partners has demonstrated, Scap is one of the most skillful and accomplished warrior-diplomats.  He knows how to build solidarity with our allies.  He has experience leading and enabling joint command and allied forces.  And he knows how to prevent provocations from escalating. And third, Scap's innovative approach to difficult challenges.  Like Phil, he has an ability to think differently to address complex situations.  For example on the Korean Peninsula, Phil showed creative thinking and developing a conditions-based approach that established the lines of command and control in a crisis.  I'm confident he will bring this kind of creative thinking to similar challenges here in Europe. From Scap's first days as a soldier, he has recognized the awesome responsibilities of command.  These are lessons he began to appreciate even before he arrived at West Point, truths modeled for him by his father, who served in the Second World War as a noncommissioned officer and for decades as a reservist. And as an officer, he has understood personally where so much of our strength lies, in an NCO corps that's well-trained, and trusted and empowered.  Certainly, Scap has always been a soldier's soldier.  But in his leadership, and example, he has proven that he remains a soldier's general. In his hometown of Logan, Ohio, there's a bridge over the new river, named for both Scap and his father.  And it's a fitting tribute.  General Scaparrotti's success has come from his ability to build bridges – between Allies and partners, between diverse elements within our joint force, between the pride we take in our past and the security imperatives of the future. today as we mark this change of command, we build another bridge between the leadership of two proven statesmen, two Joint-Force warriors, two coalition builders.  And as we mark a change in command, we also celebrate a remarkable continuity. While these two men have lead in different domains and different theaters, they both understand the powerful responsibility of asking young people like those from this command before me for me to enter extreme danger to accomplish a vital mission.  These are two leaders who appreciate deeply the weight of all we ask our troops and their families to carry. We cannot predict precisely how or when the men and women of EUCOM will be called to carry forward their mission in the months and years to come.  But we do know this.  We know that General Scaparrotti will lead this team with certainty, clarity and with our total trust and confidence.  And we know that the force General Scaparrotti inherits is ready to execute its vital responsibilities, thanks to General Breedlove's visionary leadership and unyielding commitment to our force. So to General Scaparrotti, to General Breedlove, to their families, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership to face the challenges of a complex world, thank you. ",Remarks at EUCOM Change of Command,https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/750946/remarks-at-eucom-change-of-command/
"March 17, 2016","I. PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee:  Thank you for inviting me here today, and for your steadfast support for the men and women of the Department of Defense (DoD), military and civilian alike, who serve and defend our country all over the world.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget submission for the Defense Department. At this time last year, we were all facing the bleak prospect of looming budget sequestration, and the damage its return would do to our people and our mission.  I’m grateful that our country’s leaders were able to come together last fall to avert that dismal future, and reach a budget deal that – after several years of fiscal turmoil and reductions – has allowed for greater investment in all our elements of national security and strength.  That was what I urged since becoming Secretary of Defense, including in last year’s budget testimony before this committee, and given the threat environment we face around the world, forging that deal was the responsible thing to do.  It allows our military personnel and their families to know their future more than just one year at a time, which they deserve.  It lets our defense industry partners be more efficient and cutting edge, as we need them to be.  And, perhaps most importantly, it sends a signal to the world – to friends and potential foes alike – of our nation’s strength and resolve. The President’s budget submission accordingly adheres to that budget deal – requesting a total of $582.7 billion for the Defense Department in FY 2017, for both the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds combined.  How we plan to invest those funds, along with our planned investments for the next five years – as detailed in the customary Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that’s included in the President’s budget submission – are critical to DoD’s ability to carry out our mission of national defense with the excellence the American people expect of their military, which is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known. As you know, no one got everything they wanted in the budget deal – I said last year that we needed to rise above our differences, and I’m glad many members of Congress were able to do that – so in budgeting and programming for FY 2017, we had to make responsible choices.  The President’s budget submission reflects those choices, and we need your support for them.  This is particularly true for prudent and necessary reforms – some of which the Congress has long denied, in spite of the cost to both DoD and to America’s taxpayers.  Indeed, while DoD is grateful to this and the other defense committees for your support for the budget deal, it is also the defense committees that in recent years have been tying our hands on reform, as I will address later in this testimony. We should remember, however, that the budget deal only covered two years.  Unless Congress addresses the years beyond it and heads off sequestration, DoD will face $100 billion in cuts from 2018 to 2021, which would introduce unacceptable risks.  So Washington will need to come together once again – not unlike last year, and two years before that – to provide stability and protect our national security. That’s important, because in this budget submission, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we must fight and win today’s fights, we must also be prepared to deter and if necessary fight and win the fights that might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on changing its shape in fundamental ways – making choices and tradeoffs to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future.  II. A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT Let me now describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe, as we have been since the end of World War II.  As we fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era. Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused on large-scale counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DoD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full-spectrum warfighting.  While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it’s also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL, and the resurgence of Russia, being just the most prominent examples. This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we’ve seen in history following major wars.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different – and more diverse and complex in the scope of its challenges – than the one we’ve been engaged with for the last 25 years, and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. Accordingly, five evolving challenges are now driving the focus of DoD’s planning and budgeting. Two of these challenges reflect a recognition of – return to, in some ways – great power competition.  This is something we haven’t seen for some time, and that requires heightened focus given its potential impact on our nation and the world.  The first such challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  The second is in the Asia-Pacific, where we haven’t faced great power competition since the end of World War II, and where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future. Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  One is North Korea, which remains dangerous to both us and our allies – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran – because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and doesn’t limit DoD in any way, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment. Challenge number five, no less important than the other four, is our ongoing fight to counter terrorism, and especially defeat ISIL – most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also where it is metastasizing, in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere – at the same time as we’re protecting our homeland.  While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective and in our budgeting we must also take into account that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, countering terrorists will be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of DoD and other national security leaders. DoD must and will address all five of these challenges as part of its mission to defend this country.  Doing so requires some new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities. Key to our approach is being able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  This means we must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action, or make them deeply regret it if they do.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we are able to win, on our terms.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict. We have this ability with respect to North Korean and Iranian military forces, as well as in executing the military aspects of countering terrorists, as we’re doing now against ISIL.  That won’t change, even as we know that military power alone cannot prevail without capable and motivated local forces to sustain ISIL’s defeat – nor can the United States alone deliver a lasting defeat – against the toxic ideology of terrorists like ISIL that have so little regard for the lives of fellow human beings. In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and are continuing to advance military systems that threaten our advantages in specific areas, and in some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives in ways they hope would preempt a response by the United States.  Because of these facts, because the implications of any great-power conflict would be so dire for the United States and the world, and because of those nations’ actions to date – from Ukraine to the South China Sea – DoD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting to ensure we maintain our advantages in the future. While we do not desire conflict with any of these nations – and, to be clear, though they pose some similar defense challenges, they are very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they choose to pursue.  That is the responsible course of action for the Defense Department.  Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and even as we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them, which is itself a key part of deterrence. Our military must be balanced with the proper size and capability to defeat any attack against U.S. forces and our allies.  And because of the decisions in this budget, our military will be better prepared for both present and future challenges, and better positioned to deter, and if necessary fight and win, wars against even the most high-end of potential adversaries. As this budget addresses those five evolving challenges, it also seizes great opportunities – in supporting new and innovative operational concepts; in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, including undersea, cyber, space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities; in reforming the defense enterprise; and in building the force of the future.  I will address the investments we’re making to do so later in this testimony.  III. SUPPORTING THE STRENGTH AND WELLNESS OF TODAY’S FIGHTING FORCE Before I address how this budget ensures we meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, I want to first emphasize our enduring commitment to supporting the men, women, and families of the world’s finest fighting force.  Above all, this means exercising the utmost care in decisions involving the deployment and employment of our troops.  It also requires devoting a significant share of our budget every year toward supporting the people, military and civilian alike, who execute DoD’s missions around the world. To ensure we have a force that’s ready to carry out today’s missions, this budget invests in the four main things that every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine needs to do their job – the right training; the right equipment; the right force size, meaning the right number of people alongside them; and the right compensation. The Right Training In FY 2017 and beyond, the budget makes critical investments in training throughout the force to rebuild toward full-spectrum combat readiness and continue recovering from the damage caused by sequestration in recent years – though, it’s important to remember that restoring readiness requires not only sufficient funding, but also time.  The budget maximizes use of the Army’s decisive action Combat Training Centers, funding 19 total Army brigade-level training rotations.  It provides robust funding to sustain the Navy and Marine Corps’ current training levels and readiness recovery plans for FY 2017 – optimizing Navy training while maximizing the availability of naval forces for global operations, and fully funding the Marine Corps’ integrated combined arms exercises for all elements of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  And, because recent operational demands like the fight against ISIL have slowed the Air Force’s return to full-spectrum readiness, the budget increases funding – as part of a $1 billion increase over the FYDP to support Air Force readiness – to modernize and expand existing Air Force training ranges and exercises here at home, providing pilots and airmen with more realistic training opportunities when they’re not deployed. The Right Equipment The budget also makes important investments to provide our men and women in uniform with functioning, well-maintained equipment so that when we send them into the fights of today, they’re able to accomplish their mission and come home safely.  For example, to address the Navy and Marine Corps’ growing maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F-18 depot maintenance capacity, and it buys an additional 16 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and FY 2018 – providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps’ 4th-generation fighter aircraft fleet so it’s ready and capable for today’s missions.  To help ensure the Air Force has enough ready and capable aircraft for both combat missions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), the budget funds improvements in the avionics and electronic warfare systems of legacy fighter and bomber aircraft, and it supports the Air Force’s ‘get well plan’ for remotely-piloted aircraft. The budget also makes critical investments in every domain to research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and equipment our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  I will detail those investments later in this testimony. The Right Force Size The flexibility provided by last fall’s budget deal allowed us to maintain DoD’s desired targets across the FYDP for end-strength and active-reserve mix for our ground forces – without it, sequestration likely would have forced further reductions.  Therefore, the budget stabilizes our total ground force end-strength by the end of FY 2018 with an Army of 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 56 total Army brigade combat teams and associated enablers – and a Marine Corps of 182,000 active-duty Marines and 38,500 Marine reservists.  For the Navy, the budget continues to grow the size, and importantly the capability, of the battle fleet – providing for 380,900 active-duty and reserve sailors in FY 2017, and an increase from 280 ships at the end of FY 2016 to 308 ships at the end of the FYDP.  The budget also supports an Air Force of 491,700 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard airmen – maintaining 55 tactical fighter squadrons over the next five years, and providing sufficient manpower to address high operating tempo and shortfalls in maintenance specialists for both tactical fighters and remotely-piloted aircraft. The Right Compensation In FY 2017, the budget provides $177.9 billion in pay and benefits – including health care, housing allowances, commissaries, retirement, and other benefits – for DoD’s 2.1 million military personnel and their families.  I will discuss DoD’s proposed reforms to some of these areas later in this testimony.  To help make sure DoD is competitive for the best talent, the budget includes a department-wide pay raise of 1.6 percent in FY 2017.  This is an increase above FY 2016’s pay raise of 1.3 percent. It’s important to note that of all the cuts we’ve taken to our previously-planned budgets since the Budget Control Act was passed, including cuts from sequestration – altogether so far totaling at least $800 billion over ten years – less than 9 percent of those reductions came from military compensation proposals.  This should make clear that we’ve worked extremely hard to protect our people, and that we do need to address some places where savings can be found, such as through modernizing and simplifying our military healthcare system, which I address later in this testimony. More Than Military Readiness Beyond ensuring the combat readiness of America’s military, our commitment to the force of today also encompasses what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people.  We’re putting a priority on preventing and eliminating sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, investing $246 million in FY 2017 to help support survivors, reduce retaliation for reporting, and eradicate these crimes from our ranks – and soon, DoD will deliver to Congress our strategy on addressing retaliation, in particular.  We’re also helping provide transition support and advocating for employment opportunities for veterans, investing a total of $109 million in FY 2017 so our people can make the most of their potential and keep making a difference when they complete their service in uniform.  And we’re fostering greater diversity of our force, because our strength depends on being open to the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards – young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, open, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century. That’s one reason why we’re opening all remaining combat positions to women, so that we have access to 100 percent of our population for every position in the all-volunteer force and every American who can meet our exacting standards has the full and equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  That said, since the declaration that opens all career fields to women is by itself not sufficient for their full integration, I’ve asked the military services to mitigate any concerns about combat effectiveness by incorporating my seven guiding principles – transparent standards, population size, talent management, physical demands and physiological differences, operating abroad, conduct and culture, and assessment and adjustment – into their implementation plans, which I have reviewed and approved and are now being carried out.  First and foremost, this means the services will continue to apply objective standards for all career fields to ensure leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.  This may mean in some cases, equal opportunity may not always equate to equal participation.  Integration provides equal opportunity for men and women who can perform the tasks required; it does not guarantee women will fill these roles in any specific number or at any set rate, as adherence to a merit-based system must continue to be paramount.  Also, we must incorporate concrete ways to mitigate the potential for higher injury rates among women, and leverage lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan to address concerns regarding operating in areas where there is cultural resistance to working with women.  We must address attitudes toward team performance through education and training, including making clear that sexual assault or harassment, hazing, and unprofessional behaviors are never acceptable.  Our core beliefs in good order, discipline, leadership, and accountability are foundational to our success in integration.  And it is absolutely critical that we embark on integration with a commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and in-stride adjustment that enables sustainable success. Finally, it’s important to remember that our commitment to the force of today is not limited to those who serve in uniform.  In FY 2017, it also includes $79.3 billion to support our civilian workforce of 718,000 Americans – men and women across the country and around the world who do critical jobs like helping repair our ships and airplanes, providing logistics support, developing and acquiring weapon systems, supporting survivors of sexual assault, and helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured personnel.  The budget includes $7.7 billion to support our military families, because they serve too.  It includes $3.1 billion to help take care of our wounded warriors, to whom our commitment is and must remain as strong as ever.  And it includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  IV. ADJUSTING TO STRATEGIC CHANGE Another significant portion of our budget goes toward DoD’s current operations all around the world, in every domain, to help defend our country, our allies, and our interests.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to helping the President address key national security challenges, and my priorities for how we must adjust to strategic change – in countering terrorists, whether ISIL, al-Qaeda, or others; in taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression; in operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; in deterring Iranian aggression and malign influence; in standing alert on the Korean Peninsula; and in addressing threats from multiple directions in cyber, space, and electronic warfare.  We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges; we must and will address them all, and not only be prepared across the spectrum of conflict, but also for the possibility of multiple conflicts in overlapping timeframes. Countering Terrorism It is clear that our mission of countering terrorists and other violent extremists around the world will be with us for some time.  The Department of Defense has strong counterterrorism capabilities, and we continue to deploy them to protect America. Dealing ISIL a Lasting Defeat We must and will deal ISIL a lasting defeat, which is why the budget provides $7.5 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Inherent Resolve.  This investment will be critical to continuing to implement and accelerate the coalition military campaign plan that the United States has developed, that our key allies support, and that focuses on three military objectives:  One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by attacking its two power centers in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria; these cities constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic and ideological centers of gravity, which is why our plan has big arrows pointing toward both.  Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear.  And three, our most important mission, which is to protect the homeland. To eliminate the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, DoD is enabling local, motivated forces with critical support from a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities-ranging from airstrikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice and assistance.  It must be local forces who deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, because only they can secure and govern the territory by building long-term trust within the populations they liberate.  We can and will enable such local forces, but we cannot substitute for them.  Accordingly, the budget’s investment in the counter-ISIL campaign includes $630 million for training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces, and $250 million for enabling Syrian anti-ISIL forces. This is a worthy investment, as we’ve already started to see our investments over the last several months start to pay off.  For example, it was Iraqi soldiers who took back the Ramadi city center, reversing a loss the Iraqi army suffered last spring.  Our support to them included advanced training, tactics, air support, and the portable bridges that carried the Iraqi military across the Euphrates River and into the decisive fight.  Ramadi, like recent Iraqi gains in Bayji, Tikrit, and Sinjar, demonstrates that the approach we are taking is having an effect as Iraqis prepare for what will be a tough fight for Mosul.  Likewise in Syria, local anti-ISIL forces we’ve enabled with equipment and ammunition have had successes in Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, and Shaddadi.  It is imperative to keep building on this momentum. As we work with our partners to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas like North and West Africa and Afghanistan.  Having taken out ISIL’s leader in Libya in November, we are also now prepared to step up pressure on ISIL in Afghanistan to check their ambitions there as well. Finally, at the same time that we accelerate our campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners – there can be no free riders.  That’s why last month in Brussels I convened the first-ever meeting of defense ministers from 27 other countries involved in the military coalition to defeat ISIL to follow up after I personally reached out to dozens of defense ministers to urge them to consider filling critical military and non-military needs in the campaign.  And I’m gratified to report that coalition members responded to our challenge – and not only NATO allies like Canada and the Netherlands, but also Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  In sum, nearly 90 percent of the countries participating in the coalition’s military campaign have either stepped up their role or committed to do so in the coming days.  Their decisions to expand air operations, send more trainers, provide logistical support, help with reconstruction, or make other contributions will all help our coalition intensify the counter-ISIL campaign and bring about ISIL’s lasting defeat. None of this changes the fact that our counter-ISIL campaign is a hard and complex fight.  We have tactical and strategic goals, but they will take time – and, as is often said, the enemy gets a vote.  For our part, we will remain focused, committed, and resilient because this is a fight we can, must, and will win, as our efforts to accelerate our campaign are already producing real and promising results. Ensuring Long-Term Stability in Afghanistan After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan, we have to make sure our gains there stick, which is why the budget continues to support our two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).  In support of those two missions, the President announced last fall that the United States will maintain a continued presence of 9,800 troops through most of 2016 before drawing down to 5,500 troops by January 2017.  As I told our troops there when I visited them this past December, while Afghanistan remains a dynamic fight, we are determined to ensure that terrorists – regardless of whether they’re al-Qaeda or ISIL – never have or find safe haven there again. The budget provides $41.7 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel – including funding to support our posture in U.S. Central Command, the full funding of $3.4 billion to support the ANDSF, and $1.4 billion to support other coalition partners.  Importantly, this allows us to continue strengthening and developing the ANDSF’s aviation, logistics, intelligence, and special operations capabilities, with the intent of reducing their dependency on us over time.  Also, in addition to upholding our commitments to Afghanistan, the Afghan people, and other partners, the budget reflects that the United States will retain several key locations in 2016 and beyond, including facilities in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.  As we do so, the United States will support the continuation of the NATO mission in Afghanistan in 2016 and beyond, and continue to consult with our NATO allies and partners to ensure that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan are mutually supportive. Our continued presence in Afghanistan is not only a sensible investment to counter threats that exist and stay ahead of those that could emerge in this volatile region; it also supports the willing partner we have in the government of Afghanistan.  It is in the United States’ interest to help them succeed, for the benefit of their security, our security, the region and the world. Establishing an Alternative to the Detention Facility at Guantanamo The Defense Department is resolutely committed to responsibly closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay through the establishment of an alternative detention facility.  I share the President’s belief – and the belief of many in Congress – that doing so would benefit our national security, which is why DoD will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when we have substantially mitigated any security risks to the United States. Over the last four months, we completed transfers for 16 detainees, bringing the population to 91.  Like every transfer that came before them, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government. That said, because many of the remaining detainees currently cannot be safely transferred to another country, we need an alternative to this detention facility.  Therefore, I support the President’s plan to establish and bring those detainees to an appropriate, secure, alternative location in the United States.  I appreciate that Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal, and, in accordance with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD delivered that plan to Congress in February.  We look forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate design, legislative foundation, and geographic location for future detention and to lift the restrictions preventing the responsible closure of the facility at Guantanamo. Supporting and Maintaining our Counterterrorism Capabilities In addition to the specific funds outlined above, the budget also reflects other investments we’re making in DoD’s posture to ensure we can counter terrorism effectively wherever it challenges us.  For example, the budget sustains our robust funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, allocating $10.8 billion in FY 2017.  To bolster our partners in fighting terrorism, it requests $1 billion for our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  And it supports the development of DoD’s transregional counterterrorism strategy, which I’d like to outline now. The terrorist threat is continually evolving, changing focus, and shifting location, requiring us to be flexible, nimble, and far-reaching in our response.  Accordingly, the Defense Department is leveraging the existing security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe, so that we can counter transnational and transregional terrorist threats like ISIL and others in a sustainable, durable way going forward.  From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain last October to those I visited in Jalalabad, Afghanistan last December, these locations and associated forces in various regions help keep us postured to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds.  In a practical sense, they enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent terrorist group affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the main entities themselves.  This transregional approach is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this in action was our November strike on Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill him.  To help implement this strategy, including in the fight against ISIL and its metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, the budget includes an additional $175 million in FY 2017 – $9 million to help bolster our posture in the Levant, and $166 million to help us better address threats in North and West Africa in conjunction with our European partners. Because the accelerating intensity of our precision air campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria has been depleting our stocks of some of the GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets we use against terrorists the most, the budget invests $1.8 billion in FY 2017 to buy over 45,000 more of them.  Furthermore, DoD is also exploring increasing the production rate of these munitions in our industrial base – calling on America’s great arsenal of democracy to help us and our partners finish the job of defeating ISIL. Also, because our remotely-piloted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft play an important role in countering terrorism, the budget includes $1.2 billion for FY 2017 and $4.5 billion over the FYDP to increase the number of around-the-clock permissive ISR combat air patrols from 70 today to 90 by the end of FY 2018.  Using a mix of MQ-9 Reapers, Extended Range Reapers, and MQ-1C Advanced Gray Eagles – and comprising 60 patrols from the Air Force, 16 from the Army, and 14 that are government-owned and flown by contractors for the Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command – these investments will be critical as the need for ISR continues to increase around the world. Finally, because it helps us maintain a larger Air Force fighter fleet that can drop more smart bombs in our counter-ISIL air campaign, the budget also further defers the A-10 Thunderbolt’s final retirement until 2022.  I saw some of the A-10s that are flying bombing missions against ISIL when I was at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey last December, and we need the additional payload capacity they can bring to the fight.  Accordingly, we are also changing the rate at which we will phase out the A-10 as we approach 2022, as I will explain later in this testimony. A Strong and Balanced Strategic Approach to Deter Russia Despite the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community, and also Russia itself so well for so long.  In Europe, Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  In Syria, Russia has been pouring gasoline on a civil war, fueling the very extremism Russia claims to oppose.  At sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow’s nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to brandishing nuclear weapons. To be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy, even as it may view us that way.  But make no mistake – we will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all.  That’s why the United States is taking a strong and balanced strategic approach in response to Russia’s aggression:  strengthening both our allies and ourselves, including through investments in this budget, while also giving Russia the opportunity, if it chooses, to rejoin the international community and work with us where our interests align. Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, DoD’s budgets have made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies; for example, contributing to NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  This budget builds on that significantly, and breaks new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterring – and, if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future.  The 20th century NATO playbook was successful in working toward a Europe whole, free and at peace, but the same playbook would not be well-matched to the needs of the 21st century.  Together with our NATO allies, we must write a new playbook, which includes preparing to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, better integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to adapt and respond to new challenges and new threats. To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative to make a total investment of $3.4 billion for FY 2017 – more than quadrupling the $789 million that we requested last year – allowing us to increase the amount of prepositioned equipment sets in Europe as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies.  This increase supports the persistent rotational presence of an armored brigade combat team for 12 months out of the year, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European friends and allies.  It supports more warfighting gear, including forward-stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017.  It supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such that this equipment – along with assigned Army airborne and Stryker brigade combat teams and Marine Corps heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – will allow us to rapidly form a highly-capable combined-arms ground force of division-plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C tactical fighter squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft. In addition, the budget reflects how we’re doing more, and in more ways, with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, this includes building toward a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap up to Norway’s North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe’s first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to our British allies.  And, given Russia’s use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – the budget supports more rotational presence of U.S. special operations forces exercising in Europe. The budget also significantly funds important new technologies that, when coupled with revised operational concepts, will ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  While I will address these areas in greater detail later in this posture statement, investments that are most relevant to deterring Russia include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-range anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber, and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for electronic warfare, space, and cyberspace.  The budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent. Consistent with our strong and balanced approach, the door will remain open for Russia to reassume the role of respected partner going forward.  While that would be greatly welcomed by the United States, and the Department of Defense, it’s up to the Kremlin to decide – first by demonstrating a willingness to return to the international community. Operationalizing the Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific The budget also supports operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.  In a region home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy, for 70 years the United States has helped underwrite a stable security environment that allowed the people, economies, and countries in the Asia-Pacific to rise and prosper.  We fully intend to continue these efforts so that bright future can be possible for everyone in this important region. Accordingly, the budget helps improve DoD’s geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable posture in the region, through which the United States seeks to preserve peace and stability, and maintain our strategic advantage in an area that’s critically important to America’s political, economic, and security interests.  Investments in the budget reflect how we’re moving more of our forces to the region – such as 60 percent of our Navy and overseas Air Force assets – and also some of our most advanced capabilities in and around the region, from F-22 stealth fighter jets and other advanced tactical strike aircraft, to P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, to our newest surface warfare ships.  They also reflect how we’re developing and implementing new posture initiatives – in places like Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore, as well as modernizing our existing footprint in Korea and Japan – and continuing to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones, from India to Vietnam.  And they reflect our efforts to support and strengthen a regional security architecture that benefits everyone – from strengthening and modernizing our alliances, to bolstering our ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to building the security capabilities of our many friends and allies, who increasingly want to do more with us in the region.  In support of this effort, the budget fully supports our five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative begun in FY 2016. For this region, as it does with Europe, the budget also significantly funds important new technologies to ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These investments – which I will outline later in this testimony – are important for ensuring our forces can go anywhere, at any time, and succeed in whatever mission we ask of them. It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, because it’s good for the region and good for our collective interests.  That includes China.  As we welcome the growth and prosperity of all Asia-Pacific nations, it is clear that the U.S.-China relationship will be complex as we continue to balance our competition and cooperation.  There are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China – for example, we’ve agreed to four confidence-building agreements, including one meant to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  But there remain areas of concern. For one, the United States joins virtually everyone else in the region in being deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  U.S. military presence in the region is decades-old, has been instrumental in upholding the rules-based international system, and has laid the foundation for peace and security in the region.  Our interest is in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight, full and unimpeded lawful commerce, and that disputes are resolved peacefully.  To accomplish this, we will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  We also expect China to uphold President Xi’s pledge not to pursue militarization in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. Also, we are closely watching the long-term, comprehensive military modernization program that China, as well as other countries, continues to pursue.  While there is no question that the United States retains a decisive military edge in the Asia-Pacific today, China is investing in capabilities to counter third-party – including the United States – intervention during a crisis or conflict.  These capabilities include ballistic and cruise missiles of increasingly greater range and accuracy, counter-space and offensive cyber capabilities, and electronic warfare systems.  To maintain a lasting competitive advantage, DoD is taking prudent steps to preserve and enhance deterrence for the long term.  The budget reflects this, including with investments to continue adapting our forces, posture, operations, and capabilities to deter aggression, defend our allies, and sustain our military edge in the Asia-Pacific. Deterring North Korea The budget also supports investments necessary to deter North Korean provocation and aggression, ensure our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready and capable to ‘fight tonight’ if necessary, and defend against threats emanating from North Korea against the United States and our allies.  This includes threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, against which DoD is fully capable of defending the U.S. homeland.  Our position has been, and remains, that North Korea must abide by its international obligation to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and stop its provocative behavior. North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6th and its ballistic missile launch on February 7th were highly provocative acts that undermine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.  The United States condemns these violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again calls on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.  We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. DoD remains fully capable of fulfilling U.S. treaty commitments to our allies in the event of a North Korean attack, and we’re working with our Republic of Korea allies to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat.  I spoke with my South Korean counterpart shortly after the nuclear test, and reiterated our commitments as strong and steadfast allies.  Also, a few hours after the ballistic missile launch, the United States and the Republic of Korea jointly announced the start of formal consultations to discuss the feasibility of deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the Korean Peninsula at the earliest date. Checking Iran’s Malign Influence while Strengthening Regional Friends and Allies The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges, but there, as everywhere, DoD’s budget – and accordingly our actions and strong military posture – is guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s interests.  Defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria, which I discussed earlier, is of course one of those interests, but amid this region’s complexity and uncertainty, we also have other interests of great importance, which are to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; and to check Iran’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  That’s why DoD maintains tens of thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along with our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action places significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, it does not limit in any way what DoD can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance in order to provide all options, as the President has directed, should Iran walk away from its commitments under this deal.  So if Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can immediately respond and rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach. This budget invests in maintaining those abilities going forward, which is important, because Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is contributing to disorder in Yemen, while still directing hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel.  To continue to meet our commitments and enhance our cooperation with our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, the budget makes critical investments – including $146 million to support Israel in FY 2017.  This reflects our unshakeable commitment to Israel and its security, with funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow, and other cooperative defense programs – not only ensuring that Israel can defend itself, but also preserving and enhancing Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is a cornerstone of our defense relationship. Meanwhile, with critical investments in other areas, the budget enables DoD to continue to advance our preparations, posture, partnerships, and planning to preserve the President’s options for any contingency.  It strengthens the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran’s ability to coerce its neighbors.  And it helps us stay ahead of the risks posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, naval forces, cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the region. Addressing Threats in Cyber, Space, and Electronic Warfare Even as we make adjustments in our budget to address the five evolving challenges posed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda, we are also making adjustments to address emerging and increasing threats that transcend individual nations and organizations.  That’s because, as we confront these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also led to vulnerabilities that potential adversaries are eager to exploit. As I made clear when I released DoD’s new cyber strategy last April, we have three missions in cyberspace – first and foremost, to defend our networks, systems, and information; second, to help defend the nation and our interests from cyberattacks of significant consequence, working with other departments and branches of government; and third, to provide options that can augment our other military systems.  Given the increasing severity and sophistication of the threats and challenges we’re seeing in cyberspace – ranging from ISIL’s pervasive online presence to the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management – the budget puts a priority on funding our cyber strategy, investing a total of $6.7 billion in FY 2017 and $34.6 billion over the FYDP.  This is a $900 million increase over last year’s budget.  While these funds will help us continue to develop, train, and equip our growing Cyber Mission Force, and also make new technological investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and capabilities – both of which I address later in this testimony – the budget also reflects our efforts to make a fundamental shift toward a culture of accountability in cyberspace, from instituting a DoD-wide cybersecurity scorecard to monitor our progress to increasing individual knowledge about practical ways to defend against cyber intrusions.  Our people understandably hold themselves to very high standards when it comes to caring for, attending to, using, and being accountable for the weapons they carry into battle, and we must do the same when it comes to interacting with our networks and cyber capabilities – not only among our cyber warriors and IT professionals, but throughout the DoD workforce. While at times in the past space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that’s not the case anymore, and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  This means that as we continue to ensure our access to space so we can provide capabilities like reconnaissance, GPS, and secure communications that enable and enhance our operations in other domains, we must also focus on assuring and defending these capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs of others.  Though competitors may understand our reliance on space, we will not let them use it against us, or take it away.  As I will discuss later in this testimony, this budget makes important investments to do just that – sustaining and building on the major shifts DoD began funding in last year’s budget submission – with a total of more than $22 billion for space in FY 2017.  With the presence of so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet:  free and open to all. Finally, high-end competitors have also invested in electronic warfare systems as a cost-effective way to challenge the United States and try to blunt our technological advantage.  By jamming our radars, communications, and GPS, these systems would seek to disrupt the integrated capabilities that allow our forces to identify, target, reach, and destroy an enemy with precision.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why this budget deliberately invests in buying more electronic protection and resiliency for our current systems as well as developing more advanced capabilities.  I will address these investments in more detail later in this testimony.  V. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE The other significant share of our budget goes toward making sure DoD will be ready for the future.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to create a Defense Department that’s open to change and new ideas to ensure a better future for both DoD and the nation, and my priorities in doing so.  These are best understood through the four key pillars of this commitment – namely, updating and refining warfighting strategies, operational concepts, and tactics; driving smart and essential technological innovation; building the force of the future; and reforming the DoD enterprise. While I will describe what we’re doing in each of those areas momentarily, the dynamic strategic environment I described earlier in this testimony explains why such change is so important – not for the sake of change, but for the security of this country.  We cannot let those challenges overtake us; we have to stay ahead of them and stay the best.  That’s why as Secretary of Defense I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box. Updating and Refining Warfighting Strategies, Operational Concepts, and Tactics Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win both the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, and to make sure that the plans apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats to our security, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  We’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners think about what happens if they have to execute their plan at the same time as another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into the trap of presuming the contingency they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  And we’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we must be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them. As I mentioned earlier, DoD is continuing to embark on a force-wide, all-service transition from an era focused on counterinsurgency operations to an era focused on the full spectrum of military operations.  While we do so for many important reasons, it’s also important to note that we don’t want to forget or turn our back on counterinsurgency, but rather enable most of our forces to be capable of doing a lot more than just that.  A smaller segment of our force will still specialize in these skills, and DoD will retain the ability to expand our operational capacity for counterinsurgency missions should it become necessary. The transition to full-spectrum operations is and will be coupled with demonstrations to clearly signal it and make that signal credible, which is key to conventional deterrence.  The same is true for our investments in capabilities – in new technologies, new operational concepts, and also innovative ways for how we use what we already have – these must and will be demonstrated as well.  This is accounted for in the budget, as are other investments we’re making to recommit ourselves to deterrence across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict. Recognizing the immense value that wargaming has historically had in strengthening our force in times of strategic, operational, and technological transition – such as during the interwar years between World War I and World War II, when air, land, and naval wargamers developed innovative approaches in areas like tank warfare and carrier aviation – this budget makes significant new investments to reinvigorate and expand wargaming efforts across the Defense Department.  With a total of $55 million in FY 2017 as part of $526 million over the FYDP, this will allow us to try out nascent operational concepts and test new capabilities that may create operational dilemmas and impose unexpected costs on potential adversaries.  The results of future wargames will be integrated into DoD’s new wargaming repository, which was recently established to help our planners and leaders better understand and shape how we use wargames while also allowing us to share the insights we gain across the defense enterprise. Driving Smart and Essential Technological Innovation The investments this budget makes in technology and innovation, and the bridges it helps build and rebuild, are critical to staying ahead of future threats in a changing world.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially DoD.  Today, not only is much more technology commercial, but the competition is global, with other countries trying to catch up with the advances we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber, and space.  So now, as we have in the past, DoD must invest to ensure America pioneers and dominates these and other technological frontiers. DoD is therefore pursuing new technology development along with new operational concepts, and new organizational constructs – all of which are reflected in or supported by this budget submission – to maintain our military’s technological superiority and ensure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.  How we do this is important, because while the Cold War arms race was characterized mostly by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, this era of technological competition is uniquely characterized by an additional variable of speed, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy; what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to upgrade them and repurpose them to be used in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats. In particular, this means leveraging the capability of current and emerging technologies, including commercial technologies wherever appropriate.  It means demonstrating and seeding investments in new capabilities and concepts to counter advanced anti-access, area-denial challenges across all domains and in every region where they persist – a particular focus of DoD’s effort to develop a third offset strategy.  And also, it means investing in and operationalizing our security by leveraging advances in cyber, space, electronic warfare, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other areas.  Our technologies and capabilities must be able to operate so that no matter what any of our enemies might throw at them, they are able to defeat attempts to be hacked. Accordingly, this budget invests a total of $183.9 billion in FY 2017, and $951 billion over the FYDP, to help research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and capabilities our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  For the second year in a row, the budget increases funding for our research and development accounts, which total $71.8 billion in FY 2017.  That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services, in our dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country, and in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing. At the same time that DoD is making investments in technologies themselves, we’re also investing in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s vibrant, innovative technology community and forging more connections with the commercial technology base – and it’s reflected in our budget.  In FY 2017, this includes $45 million for our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx), which we opened in Silicon Valley last August to build relationships and better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem.  It also includes $40 million for our pilot program with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel, leveraging its venture capital model to help find innovative solutions for some of our most challenging problems.  And it includes $137 million to support our public-private partnership-funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics that I announced in Silicon Valley last August.  In all these areas, similar to how DoD’s historic investments in things like GPS and the Internet later went on to yield great benefits for not just our security but also our society, we hope the investments we’re making in some of these fields along with our partners in the technology industry will lead to incredible advances that today we can only imagine. Importantly, technological innovation must be done in concert with operational innovation.  It’s not enough to have or create new technologies or weapon systems; how they are used is key.  The budget reflects work DoD has been undertaking in this area though multiple lines of effort.  First, there’s our Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program – an effort named after the mid-1970s project that brought together a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts who paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth – and also our Advanced Capability and Deterrence Panel.  Both focus on identifying and charting longer-term, leap-ahead investments for strategies and capabilities that will give us an advantage several decades from now, and together they make up nearly 60 percent of our science and technology investments in this budget submission. Now, to focus on maintaining our near-term advantage, DoD has an office that we don’t often talk about, but that I want to highlight today.  It’s called the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO).  I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense to reimagine existing DoD, intelligence community, and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  I picked a talented physicist to lead it.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but also has the rare virtue of rapid development and the even rarer charter to keep current capabilities viable for as long as possible.  So it’s good for both troops and taxpayers alike. SCO is focused on thinking differently, which is incredibly important to innovation when it comes to technological capabilities.  Thinking differently put us in space and on the moon.  It put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips.  It’s how we came to have airplanes that take off from the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, and satellite networks that take pictures of the world and show us where we are in it.  And this kind of bold, innovative thinking isn’t lost to history.  It’s happening every day, in SCO and many other places throughout the Department of Defense. Most people don’t often hear about it because most of its work is classified; however, SCO has been a tremendously useful part of DoD.  It’s received large support from all the services, as well as our combatant commands, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and also Congress – with its budget growing from $140 million in its first year, FY 2014, to reaching $845 million for FY 2017 in this year’s budget submission.  To show the return we’re getting on those investments, I’d like to highlight some projects SCO has been working on that we’re funding in the budget. First is a project focused on advanced navigation, where SCO is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads – enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand. Another SCO project uses swarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.  For the air, they’ve developed micro-drones that are really fast, and really resilient – they can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk.  Each one leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the micro-drones use a lot of commercial components and 3D printing.  And the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote for the Mars lander. SCO also has a project on gun-based missile defense, where we’re taking the same hypervelocity smart projectile developed for the electromagnetic railgun, and using it for point defense by firing it with artillery we already have in our inventory – including the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin earlier this year, and we found that it also significantly increases the range. There’s also a SCO project that we’re calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms, and turns it into a flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads.  In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes – essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities. The last SCO project I want to highlight is how we’re creating a brand new capability with the SM-6 missile, an interceptor that’s designed to launch from our Navy’s surface ships and be highly maneuverable and aerodynamic to stop incoming ballistic and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.  It’s one of our most modern and capable munitions – and thanks to work done by SCO, we’ve been able to modify the SM-6 so that in addition to missile defense, it can also target enemy ships at sea.  This new anti-ship mode makes the SM-6 doubly useful, taking the defensive speed and maneuverability already sitting in our Aegis destroyers’ launch cells and leveraging it for offensive surface warfare lethality.  That makes it a potent new capability for our fleet, and also a good deal for the taxpayer by using the same thing twice.  We already know this works; it was fully tested this past January to great success.  And, as I will address later in this testimony, this new operational concept is strongly reflected in our 2017 budget. Those are just a few projects that SCO has worked on so far – and they’re working on a lot more, including some surprising ones. Now, with all of that in mind – from why we need to invest in technological innovation, to how we’re doing it – let me address the specific investments this budget makes in technologies and capabilities to deter, and if necessary fight and win, a full-spectrum conventional war against even the most high-end of adversaries.  In concert, they will help maintain our military’s edge both under and on the sea, on land, in the air, in space, in cyber and electronic warfare, and in the modernization and maintenance of our nuclear enterprise. Maritime Investments In the maritime domain, the budget refocuses our Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts while continuing to grow the battle fleet to meet, but not exceed, the department’s warfighting posture requirement of 308 ships.  Our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years. First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – leveraging and growing our commanding lead in an area where the U.S. military should be doing more, not less, going forward.  It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, including $170.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.5 billion over the FYDP for an improved heavyweight torpedo as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo to stay ahead of existing and emerging undersea challenges.  It includes $5.2 billion in FY 2017 and $29.4 billion over the FYDP to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; four of those submarines – up from three in last year’s budget – will be equipped with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that can more than triple each submarine’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles to 40.  The budget also invests $500 million in FY 2017, and $3.4 billion over the FYDP, to upgrade 49 of our submarines’ combat systems and enhance underwater acoustics on nine of our existing Virginia-class submarines.  It increases funding for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) by over $100 million in FY 2017, part of a total $173 million in FY 2017 and $1.2 billion over the FYDP that invests in, among other areas, rapid prototyping of UUVs in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – which is important, since UUVs can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  And it includes $2.2 billion in FY 2017 and $6.4 billion over the FYDP to continue procuring the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft.   Together, all these investments – totaling $8.2 billion in FY 2017, and $41.9 billion over the next five years – will ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world. Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary prevail in a full-spectrum conflict against even the most advanced adversaries.  It invests $597 million in FY 2017, and $2.9 billion over the FYDP, to maximize production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, procuring 125 in FY 2017 and 625 over the next five years – and this investment is doubly important given the SM-6’s new anti-ship capability.  It also invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads – including $1 billion in FY 2017, and $5.8 billion over the FYDP, for all variants of the SM-3 high-altitude ballistic missile interceptor; $340 million in FY 2017, and $925 million over the FYDP, for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile; $221 million in FY 2017, and $1.4 billion over the FYDP, for the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, including its extended range version; and $435 million in FY 2017, as part of $2.1 billion over the FYDP, for the most advanced variant of the Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which once upgraded can also be used for maritime strike. Third, the budget reflects decisions we’ve made to ensure that we look at our overall warfighting posture, rather than only the presence that contributes to it, in determining whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict.  Having grown the size and the capability of our surface and subsurface fleet over the last seven years, this budget will continue to do both.  It will ensure we meet the department’s 308-ship posture requirement – indeed, growing the battle fleet to 308 ships by the end of the FYDP – and it will make our naval forces as a whole more capable, more survivable, and more lethal than they would have been otherwise. The budget invests $3.4 billion in FY 2017 and $18.3 billion over the FYDP to continue to buy two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 over the FYDP – as well as $400 million in FY 2017 and $2.8 billion over the FYDP for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing $2.7 billion in FY 2017 and $13.5 billion over the FYDP for new construction of Ford-class carriers, as well as $2 billion in FY 2017 and $8.9 billion over the FYDP for midlife reactor refueling and overhauls on our current carrier fleet.  And, as I will discuss in the reform section of this testimony, it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers – providing them with more capability and a longer lifespan while freeing up significant funds that can be put toward a variety of uses. I’d like to now address the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), where we made an important tradeoff so we could put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and many other critical areas.  As such, the budget takes a new approach to the LCS and its associated frigate – buying a total of 40, not the 52 or more that were planned starting back in 2002.  Let me explain why.  First, to be clear, we’re investing in LCS and frigates because we need the capability they provide, and for missions like minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare, they’re expected to be very capable.  But now, in 2016, we have to further balance our shipbuilding investments among guided missile destroyers and Virginia-class attack submarines.  We face competitors who are challenging us on the open ocean with new submarines, ships, aircraft, and missiles – advanced capabilities we haven’t had to contend with in a long time, meaning that we must now invest more in higher-end capabilities across our own fleet.  The department’s warfighting analysis called for 40 small surface combatants, so that’s how many we’re buying.  Over the next 10 years, this will let us invest almost $8 billion more into highly lethal ships and capabilities – all the while increasing both the number of ships and the capability of our battle fleet.  While this will somewhat reduce the number of LCS available for presence operations, that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface, and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries.  Under this rebalanced plan, we will still achieve our 308-ship goal within the next five years, and we will be better positioned as a force to effectively deter, and if necessary defeat, even the most advanced potential adversaries. Land Investments To ensure our ground forces have the capabilities to counter emerging threats and the demonstrated ability to deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict, the budget will help provide our Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces with greater lethality in several forms.  This includes a next-generation shoulder-launched weapon, a life extension program as well as a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can be used for improved counter-battery and long-range strike, and increased firepower for Stryker armored fighting vehicles.  Together these investments comprise $780 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP. Additionally, the budget invests $735 million in FY 2017, and $6.8 billion over the FYDP, in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle intended to replace the military’s Humvees – procuring more than 2,000 vehicles in FY 2017, and a total of more than 17,700 vehicles over the next five years.  It also invests $159 million in FY 2017, and $1.7 billion over the FYDP, in the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which will replace the Marine Corps’ aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle – helping procure over 200 vehicles over the next five years.  And, as I discuss later in the reform section of this testimony, it supports the Army’s ongoing Aviation Restructure Initiative – investing $1.1 billion for 52 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.7 billion for 275 Apaches over the FYDP, as well as $1 billion for 36 UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.6 billion for 268 Black Hawks over the FYDP. The budget also invests $9.1 billion for missile defense in FY 2017, and $47.1 billion over the FYDP.  This reflects important decisions we’ve made to strengthen and improve our missile defense capabilities – particularly to counter the anti-access, area-denial challenge of increasingly precise and increasingly long-range ballistic and cruise missiles being fielded by several nations in multiple regions of the world.  Instead of spending more money on a smaller number of more traditional and expensive interceptors, we’re funding a wide range of defensive capabilities that can defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby impose higher costs on the attacker.  The budget invests in improvements that complicate enemy targeting, harden our bases, and leverage gun-based point defense capabilities – from upgrading the Land-Based Phalanx Weapons System, to developing hypervelocity smart projectiles that as I mentioned earlier can be fired not only from the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, but also the hundreds of Army M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  Additionally, the budget’s missile defense investments maintain DoD’s commitment to improving our homeland and theater defense systems – as we’re increasing the number of deployed Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) from 30 to 44, redesigning the exo-atmospheric kill vehicle to improve the reliability of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, and funding improvements and follow-on concept development for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Specifically, we’re investing $1.2 billion in FY 2017 and $5.8 billion over the FYDP for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program; for THAAD, we’re spending $640 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP, which includes procuring 24 interceptors in FY 2017 and 149 over the FYDP; and, to research, develop, and deploy a new Long-Range Discrimination Radar, we’re investing $317 million in FY 2017 and $1 billion over the FYDP. Air Investments To ensure the U.S. military’s continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in several areas – and not just platforms, but also payloads.  For example, it invests $2.4 billion in FY 2017 and $8 billion over the FYDP in a wide range of versatile munitions – including buying more Small Diameter Bombs, JDAMs, Hellfires, and AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.  We are also developing hypersonics that can fly over five times the speed of sound. The budget continues to buy the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.  It includes $10.1 billion in FY 2017 and $56.3 billion over the FYDP to procure a total of 404 F-35s across the force through 2021 – 43 F-35As for the Air Force in FY 2017 as part of 243 to be purchased over the FYDP, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 97 to be purchased over the FYDP, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 64 to be purchased over the FYDP.  This represents a slight deferral in Air Force F-35 procurement, which we’re doing in order to free up funds to maintain a larger-size Air Force of 55 tactical fighter squadrons, and to improve avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, and B-52 fleets – increasing their lethality, survivability, and therefore usefulness in a full-spectrum conflict.  At the same time, it also represents an increase in the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-35 procurement, which is important to ensure sufficient high-end capability and numbers in our aircraft carriers’ tactical fighter fleet. Additionally, the budget invests $1.4 billion in FY 2017 and $12.1 billion over the FYDP for continued development of the B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as $3.1 billion in FY 2017 and $15.7 billion over the FYDP to continue upgrading our aerial tanker fleet – buying 15 KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers in FY 2017 as part of 75 aircraft to be purchased over the FYDP. The budget also reflects important decisions regarding future unmanned aerial systems, such as the Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), formerly known as the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Air Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program – by focusing in the near-term on providing carrier-based aerial refueling, we’re setting the stage for a future unmanned carrier air wing.  With this approach, the Navy will be able to quickly and affordably field the kinds of unmanned systems that its carrier air wings need today, while laying an important foundation for future, more capable unmanned carrier-based platforms.  We know we need to ensure aircraft can operate off the carrier in high-threat environments, and we’re working hard to make them unmanned – it’s just that the UCLASS program as previously structured was not the fastest path to get us there.  This approach will allow us to get started integrating unmanned aircraft onto our aircraft carriers affordably and as soon as possible. Furthermore, to maximize the capabilities and extend the reach of all our airborne systems, the budget reflects how we’re expanding manned-unmanned teaming – from buying Navy MQ-4C Triton unmanned maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft, which can be paired with our P-8A Poseidon aircraft for a variety of missions; to buying Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that can pair with MQ-1C Gray Eagle scouts; to buying Air Force F-35s that can network with both payloads and platforms. Cyber and Electronic Warfare Investments This budget significantly increases our cyber capabilities, with new investments totaling over $900 million in FY 2017 compared to last year’s budget. Because defending our networks is and must be DoD’s number-one mission in cyberspace, the budget makes significant investments to improve our defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding.  These include $336 million over the FYDP to support more capable network perimeter defenses, as well as $378 million over the FYDP to train and strengthen DoD’s Cyber Protection Teams to respond to security breaches, grow our cyber training and testing ranges, and support tool development that will let our Cyber Mission Force quickly respond to cyberattacks against our networks regardless of where they are stationed around the world. Reflecting our renewed commitment to deterring even the most advanced adversaries, the budget also invests in cyber deterrence capabilities, including building potential military response options.  This effort is focused on our most active cyber aggressors, and is based around core principles of resiliency, denial, and response. As part of DoD’s second cyber mission – defending the nation – the budget invests in an advanced capability to disrupt cyberattacks of significant consequences.  And to support DoD’s third cyber mission – providing offensive cyber options that if directed can augment our other military systems – the budget invests $347 million over the FYDP to help provide cyber tools and support infrastructure for the Cyber Mission Force and U.S. Cyber Command. DoD has a unique level of resources and cyber expertise compared to the rest of the federal government, and following the recent data breaches of the Office of Personnel Management’s information technology systems, DoD has undertaken responsibility for the development, maintenance, and cybersecurity of the replacement background investigation systems and their data infrastructure.  To provide proper support and a dedicated funding stream for this effort, the President’s budget includes $95 million for DoD in FY 2017.  Also, on a separate but related note, the budget invests $454 million over the FYDP to ensure DoD will continue to have access to the trusted microelectronic components needed in our weapon systems.  By developing alternative sources for advanced microchips and trusted designs, this funding will help ensure the long-term security of our systems and capabilities. Meanwhile, to protect our platforms and ensure U.S. freedom of maneuver in contested environments, the budget also continues to support research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of advanced electronic warfare capabilities – totaling $3.7 billion in FY 2017 and $20.5 billion over the FYDP.  To enhance the electronic survivability and lethality of fighter and bomber aircraft like the F/A-18, F-15, and B-2, we’re investing in both offensive and defensive airborne capabilities, including the Air Force’s Defensive Management System modernization and Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, and also the Navy’s Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures and Next Generation Jammer.  We’re upgrading the radar on our E-3 Sentry AWACS with enhanced electronic protection to make adversary jammers less effective.  Investments in the Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program will help our ships protect themselves better.  And to help protect our ground forces, the budget invests in the Army’s Common Infrared Countermeasures and Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, as well as the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger pod. While cyber and electronic warfare capabilities provide, for the most part, different techniques to achieve similar mission objectives, an integrated approach can yield additional benefits.  This is reflected in our budget, including investments intended to ensure we can hold even the most challenging targets at risk. Space Investments As I mentioned earlier, this budget continues and builds upon important investments in last year’s budget to help secure U.S. access to space and address space as an operational domain. After adding over $5 billion in new investments in DoD’s 2016 budget submission to make us better postured for contested military operations in space – including over $2 billion in space control efforts to address potential threats to U.S. space systems – this budget largely sustains those investments over the FYDP.  While there is much more work ahead, we are on a good path in our efforts to complicate an adversary’s ability to defeat our systems while also enhancing our ability to identify, attribute, and negate all threatening actions in space. Meanwhile, the budget also supports strengthening our current space-based capabilities, and maturing our space command and control.  It invests in more satellites for our Space-Based Infrared System to maintain the robust strategic missile warning capability we have today.  And it allocates $108 million over the FYDP to implement the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), which will better align joint operations in space across the U.S. government. DoD must have assured access to space through multiple reliable sources that can launch our critical national security satellites, which is why the budget invests $1.8 billion for space launch in FY 2017 and $9.4 billion over the FYDP.  Because we want to end the use of the foreign RD-180 engine as soon as possible, because we have a strong desire to preserve competition for space launch in order to ensure multiple launch service providers can sustain uninterrupted access to space, and to control costs, the budget includes funds for competitive public-private partnerships to help develop new launch services, which we believe is the most responsible way forward.  Merely developing a new engine would not give us the assured access to space that we require.  We plan to take advantage of the emerging commercial space launch marketplace using an innovative, more commercial approach – investing through competition in new launch services in return for priced options for future launches. Nuclear Enterprise Investments The budget also makes reforms and investments needed to continue providing a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.  Compared to last year’s budget submission, it adds $10 billion over the next five years, for a total of $19 billion in FY 2017 and $108 billion over the FYDP for maintaining, and modernizing the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control, and communications systems.  This reflects DoD’s continuing commitment to the nuclear triad and its critical mission. In addition to making an array of investments across the nuclear enterprise – from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance, to technological efforts that improve the sustainability of our bomber fleet – the budget also fully funds the first stages of our key nuclear modernization effort, in particular the replacement of our Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.  The Ohio Replacement Program is allocated $1.9 billion in FY 2017 and $13.2 billion over the FYDP, which in addition to research and development will allow the first year of construction on an incrementally-funded first ship to begin in FY 2021. We expect the total cost of nuclear modernization to be in the range of $350-$450 billion.  Although this still presents an enormous affordability challenge for DoD, we believe it must be funded.  Previous modernizations of America’s strategic deterrent and nuclear security enterprise were accomplished by topline increases to avoid having to make drastic reductions to conventional forces, and it would be prudent to do so again.  I hope DoD can work with Congress to minimize the risk to our national defense. Building the All-Volunteer Force of the Future While we have the finest fighting force in the world today, that excellence is not a birthright, and we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again, starting with our most enduring advantage – our people. That’s what building the force of the future is all about:  making sure that long into the future, my successors will be able to count on the same excellence in people that I do today.  And we have several overarching priorities to help us do that, like attracting a new generation of talented Americans, promoting diversity, and rewarding merit; carving tunnels through the walls between DoD, the private sector, our reserve force, and other agencies across the government; and updating and modernizing our personnel management systems with technology and data analysis to help improve the choices and decisions we make related to our people. I made this commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school in Abington, Pennsylvania to outline my vision for the force of the future.  I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and labor market changes, we in the Pentagon must try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans.  In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century.  And this past December, I announced that we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force. Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  It’s not a business.  We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows our friends and family members and fellow citizens to go to school, go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give the next generation a better future. The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today. Last spring I asked DoD’s Personnel and Readiness chief to lead a team in developing a package of bold proposals, which they did – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and also coming up with some new ideas.  Subsequently, a senior leadership team led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva has been working with the service vice chiefs to closely analyze each proposal and make recommendations before I decide.  While this process is still ongoing for some proposals, I’ve decided to announce my decisions on other proposals as I’ve made them, which I will now detail. Greater Permeability and Talent Management I outlined the first link we’re building to the force of the future at George Washington University last November, announcing over a dozen new initiatives in several categories that are intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent. First, we’re creating what we call ‘on-ramps’ for people who aren’t involved with DoD but want to try contributing to our mission.  One way we’re doing this is by having better managed internship programs that more effectively transition promising interns into employees.  Another is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community for a time to help solve some of our most complex problems.  We’re also going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two.  And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles, as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Second, we’re creating short-term ‘off-ramps’ for those currently in DoD, so they can gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives from outside and then bring them back in to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking.  One way we’re doing this is by expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family.  DoD plans to seek authorities to make this program permanent, and looks forward to working with Congress to do so – similar to how we were able to partner last year to update and modernize retirement benefits and ensure that the 80 percent of our force that doesn’t serve 20 years will get the benefits they earned whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life. And third, we’re going to use 21st century data and technology to improve and modernize our talent management systems.  We’re launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help give servicemembers and units more choice in matching up for future assignments.  We’re creating an Office of People Analytics to leverage big data to inform our personnel policies.  We’re finally implementing exit surveys, so we can have quantitative data on why people decide to leave.  And to help us keep bringing in the best people, we’re looking at ways to evaluate recruit performance, improve outcomes, and better analyze trends that if left unchecked could indicate or lead to our military’s insularity from the rest of society. Family Support and Retention Next, in January, I announced our so-called second link to the force of the future, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life.  They were developed keeping in mind DoD’s recruiting, retention, and career and talent management needs, as well as our closely-linked readiness and warfighting demands, which must always guide us. We know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force – 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages, with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other.  So while we recruit a servicemember, we retain a family.  This means that what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we’re a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit, is absolutely essential to our future strength.  While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known; among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top.  We also know that at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services.  And we know that a high level of work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service. To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work-life balance.  These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly four-in-five of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce – twice the rate of baby boomers.  These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly. That’s why, for starters, we’re providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force – setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, and working with Congress to seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  These changes put DoD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  For both mothers and fathers alike, this establishes the right balance of offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force.  While I don’t take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we’re providing across the joint force.  This will be an increasingly important factor as current and future generations of parents have different views and expectations in parenting, and we must continue to be able to attract and retain the best talent among them. Additionally, we’re expanding the childcare we provide on our bases, because whether for single parents, for families in which both parents work outside the home, or for every mother or father in our military, childcare hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands.  So based on feedback from pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase childcare access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with childcare they can rely on –from before reveille to after taps – we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  And we show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals. We’re also making relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breastfeeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, we’re requiring the installation or modification of mothers’ rooms throughout all facilities when there are more than 50 women regularly assigned. Furthermore, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time preserving our force’s effectiveness.  Data indicates that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active-duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness.  DoD will be seeking legislative authority to this effect – when the needs of the force permit a servicemember to stay at their current location, we will seek to empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation. Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  To account for this more fully in the benefits we provide our troops, DoD will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active-duty servicemembers – a benefit that will help provide our men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers. Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries.  The initiatives approved to date total $867 million across the FYDP; we’ve included this in our budget because it’s a worthy investment that will yield great returns. More Still to Come While these first two links are important, we will have more to announce on the force of the future in the coming months.  For example, we’re taking a serious look at some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system, and I greatly appreciate Congressional leaders from both parties who have indicated their support for such reforms in principle.  We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions.  In both of these efforts, working with Congress will be essential to ensure that our force of the future is as strong as the force of today. Reforming the DoD Enterprise As I’ve said consistently from the moment I became Secretary of Defense, I cannot ask for more taxpayer dollars for defense without being candid about the fact that not every defense dollar is spent as wisely or responsibly as it could be, and also being determined to change that and make our department more accountable.  That’s why reforming the DoD enterprise is so important – from improving how we’re organized so we can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the future security environment, to continuing to improve our acquisition and enterprise-wide business and audit practices, to reducing excess infrastructure and overhead, to modernizing the military healthcare system. Before I address the reforms in this budget submission, it’s important to consider the recent history of defense reform – how DoD has been embarked on a reform path for much of the last seven years, and how we appreciate Congress’s work with us over the last year on acquisition and modernized retirement reforms. Despite what some may think, this administration hasn’t been dragging its feet when it comes to defense reform – the reality has been quite the opposite.  Beginning in 2009, we reduced the number of senior executives and general and flag officers, while working with Congress to trim management headquarters staffs by 20 percent, and move DoD toward auditability.  We’ve done three iterations of the Better Buying Power initiative I established to continuously improve our acquisitions, with Better Buying Power 3.0 incorporated into this budget, and we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time.  And we’ve continually submitted much-needed reforms to strengthen the efficiency and capability of our force – many of which have been continually denied, either in whole or in part, at a cost for both taxpayers and our troops.  This last part poses a real problem, because every dollar Congress denies us in reform is a dollar we can’t invest in security we need to deter and defend against today’s and tomorrow’s threats. Now is the time for action.  DoD will work closely with Congress on any anticipated reform legislation, and we welcome an open and collaborative process.  In the past, legislative reform has proven to be a double-edged sword – sometimes it leads to constructive change, which is good, but other times it just adds to bureaucracy and overhead, even if that was never the intent.  I hope that with the focus on reform we’ve recently been seeing in this and the other defense committees in Congress, we can work together to do reform right.  And we should, because there’s a lot that needs to be accomplished in many areas. Continuously Improving Acquisition DoD has been, and still is, absolutely committed to improving acquisition outcomes.  After five years of implementing our Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives for continuous process improvements in the defense acquisition system, we’re seeing compelling indications of significant improvement in acquisition outcomes – for example, annual growth metrics for contracted costs on our major programs have dropped dramatically from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2011 to a 30-year low of 3.5 percent in 2015, and a much higher percentage of major programs are projecting cost reductions relative to initial baselines than in the past.  While these developments are positive signs, we can and must do more to sustain and where possible accelerate our momentum to keep improving and deliver better military capability while protecting American taxpayers. We need to continue reducing overhead and bureaucracy associated with the acquisition system, making it more agile and having a faster flow of commercial technology into our weapon systems.  DoD is comfortable with the reforms in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act – which included several legislative reforms that DoD proposed last year – and we strongly support the increased role of the service chiefs in acquisition programs, particularly on cost and requirements trade-offs.  Going forward, it’s important that we take the responsible approach to absorb these reforms and see their effects before making additional major changes. DoD also appreciates Congress’s interest in flexibility and agility, because the pace of threat changes and technology development are not compatible with our long cycles of budget submission, authorization, and appropriations.  And DoD will be looking for opportunities to work with Congress to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our acquisition process.  In particular, we would welcome greater flexibility in appropriations or reprogramming to initiate development of urgently needed capabilities.  The flexibility to start a program as soon as a threat is identified would save critical time – as much as two years under current practices – and position both DoD and industry to more quickly initiate development, without a long-term commitment, outside the traditional budget cycle.  This step would represent a ‘free’ two years of lead time to acquiring a new capability. Leaner Business Practices and Reducing Excess Overhead and Infrastructure The budget submission reflects several important efforts to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently, generating savings that would be much better invested in other areas like the fight against ISIL or deterring Russian aggression. Part of this means making more reductions to overhead, and also adopting some commonsense business practices that are long overdue – which in total we expect to help save nearly $8 billion over the next five years.  By better managing the 20 percent management headquarters reductions I mentioned earlier, including delayering and flattening management organizational structures, and also by increasing the reduction to 25 percent, reviewing service contracts, and making business operations and IT more efficient, we expect to save close to $5.9 billion over the FYDP.  And we’re modernizing how we manage our commissaries and military exchanges, to optimize their business practices and respond to the changing needs of their customers.  Unlike commissary and military exchange reforms proposed in previous budgets, this new approach protects the benefits they provide our people while still generating expected savings of about $2 billion over the FYDP. We’re also making real progress on reforming DoD’s myriad systems and business processes to meet our commitment to be audit ready by the beginning of FY 2018.  The three military departments began audits of their budgets for the first time last year, and DoD financial audits currently cover over 75 percent of our total General Fund budgetary resources and just over 90 percent of the current year dollars. In addition, we need to stop spending so much money to hold onto bases we don’t need, and implement a domestic round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2019 as we’re requesting.  While it’s helpful that the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act allowed a study of DoD’s excess infrastructure, the bottom line is that we have more bases in more places than we need, with preliminary analysis indicating that we have over 20 percent excess infrastructure.  To ignore this fact while criticizing DoD for wasteful spending is not only a sin of omission, but also a disservice to America’s taxpayers.  Last year’s Congressional denial forced the BRAC round to slip from 2017 to 2019, further prolonging our ability to harvest savings we greatly need.  By then it will have been 14 years since DoD was allowed to right-size its domestic infrastructure, which any business leader or citizen would think is ridiculous – and they’d be right.  Now is the time to fix it. Reexamining Goldwater-Nichols and Defense Institutional Reform I appreciate that Congress shares my desire to make institutional reform a priority.  The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 was important and had deeply positive results, but after 30 years, it needs updates.  To help formulate DoD’s recommendations to Congress on reviewing Goldwater-Nichols reforms, I asked our Deputy Chief Management Officer last fall to lead a comprehensive review of organizational issues in DoD – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and the military departments – and identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of improvement. This review is currently ongoing, and preliminary internal findings are expected by the end of March to help shape our forthcoming recommendations to Congress.  In addition, and without prejudging any outcomes, I can say our review is examining areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, as in not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability; or where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, as in taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint Staff to support management, planning, and execution across the combatant commands, including for prioritizing military activities and resources across combatant command boundaries, and particularly focused on trans-regional, multi-domain, and multi-functional threats, as well as threats within overlapping time frames; ensuring the Chairman’s ability to provide their best military advice to me and the President, outside the chain of command as conceived of in the law; eliminating unnecessary overlap between OSD and the Joint Staff and between the service secretariats and staffs; better aligning combatant command staffs to their mission; streamlining acquisition requirements and decision-making processes to remove unneeded decision-making layers; having more flexibility in the laws and policies that govern joint duty qualifications; and better aligning the Joint Staff and the combatant commands to produce operational advice and respond to transregional threats. I look forward to the full results of our review, and I hope you will too.  While DoD’s current organization produces sound military advice and operational decisions, it often does so in a needlessly costly and time-consuming manner – leaving plenty of room for organizational improvements that can make us more agile and efficient.  While much is within our existing authority to do, we will work with Congressional committees to frame and seek any needed reforms in statute.  I look forward to working with you. Modernizing and Simplifying the Military Healthcare System DoD greatly appreciates that Congressional leaders have said 2016 will be the year to reform our military healthcare system, TRICARE, after having passed retirement modernization reform in 2015.  As you know, DoD has proposed various ways to reform TRICARE for several years, so we look forward to working very closely with Congress in the year ahead.  The reforms reflected in the budget give beneficiaries more simplicity and choice in how they manage their healthcare, while also incentivizing the much more affordable use of military treatment facilities.  This will not only save money, but also maximize the workload and readiness of our military’s medical force, giving our doctors, nurses, medics, and corpsmen the experience they need to be effective at their mission.  Together this should generate about $548 million in FY 2017 and almost $7 billion over the FYDP that can be better spent in other ways without sacrificing the care of our people.  It’s time to get this done. Making Sure Retirement Reform Works DoD greatly appreciates being able to work closely with Congress last year in reforming the military’s retirement system.  In this year’s budget submission, we are including a few modifications to military retirement reform to help make sure those reforms work in the best possible way for the future strength and success of our military. First, continuation pay should not be an entitlement at 12 years of service, but rather a vitally important force shaping tool.  DoD should have the flexibility to determine if and when to offer this benefit so we can better retain the talent we need the most at any given time. Second, the blended retirement plan that Congress passed last year needs some modifications to avoid having adverse effects on retention – in particular, slightly raising the maximum matching contribution from 4 percent to 5 percent.  To improve retention, we also propose increasing the number of years a servicemember has to serve before matching contributions begin – so instead of beginning them at the start of their third year of service, it would be at the start of their fifth year of service, after their first reenlistment.  DoD looks forward to working with Congress to make these proposals a reality. The Right Force Structure for Current and Future Operations The budget also reflects critical decisions on force structure reforms, all of which are vital to making sure our troops have the capabilities they need for both present and future missions.  While Congress has too often rejected such reforms out of hand, our decisions this year show that when world events and operational demands require the Defense Department to change its plans, it does so.  In turn, Congress must do the same, and recognize that with a set budget and the need to invest in advanced capabilities to strengthen high-end deterrence, it’s time to seriously consider these reforms and stop tying our hands from implementing them. I mentioned earlier that we’re pushing off the A-10’s final retirement until 2022 so we can keep more aircraft that can drop smart bombs on ISIL; in addition to changing when A-10s will be retired, we’re also changing how it will happen.  As 2022 approaches, A-10s will be replaced by F-35s only on a squadron-by-squadron basis as they come online, ensuring that all units have sufficient backfill and that we retain enough aircraft needed to fight today’s conflicts. While some members of Congress may think the Navy’s phased approach for modernizing its guided missile cruisers is just a ploy to quickly retire them, that is incorrect – in fact, retiring them now or anytime soon would be a serious mistake.  Our cruisers are the best ships we have for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and given the anti-ship missiles being developed by other nations, we not only can’t afford to go without them; we also need them to be as modern and capable as possible, and for them to stay in service as long as they can.  The Navy’s plan is still smarter and more affordable than the approach laid out by Congress, saving us $3 billion over the FYDP that we’re putting to good use elsewhere in the budget.  And to make clear that this is not a ploy to quickly retire our cruisers, we will be submitting proposed legislative language that Congress can pass to hold the department to its word. Additionally, the Army is continuing to implement its Aviation Restructure Initiative in accordance with the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act as the Chief of Staff of the Army reviews the recent findings of the National Commission on the Future of the Army.  While we will revisit the Army’s aviation transfer plan when we receive the Chief of Staff of the Army’s report, the Commission’s proposal to keep four Apache battalions in the Army National Guard could cost over $2.4 billion if the Army fully equips all 20 active battalions and keeps all aircraft currently dedicated to its equipment set in South Korea.  By improving the readiness of the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and better leveraging the diverse capabilities Black Hawk helicopters bring to the table for National Guard missions – both here at home, and around the world when called upon as an operational reserve – the Army’s planned Aviation Restructure Initiative is in the best interests of both the Army as well as the taxpayers who support it. The Opportunity of Reform Regardless of how any of our proposed reforms might be initially received, DoD needs Congress to work together with us on a path forward for all of them, because there’s a real opportunity in front of us. With last fall’s budget deal, you showed that cooperation and prudent compromise for the good of our future security and strength was actually possible.  And our reform submissions on things like the A-10, commissaries, and TRICARE reflect the fact we’ve heard Congress’s concerns about past submissions, and made adjustments accordingly. If we don’t lead the way ahead together, both troops and taxpayers alike will be forced to deal with the consequences.  So let’s work together on their behalf.  VI. REQUESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE: THE IMPERATIVE OF WORKING TOGETHER Before concluding, I want to reemphasize the big picture, because this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, and we need your support for it. For a long time, DoD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts – long-term at the expense of the here-and-now.  Thankfully we were able to realize that over the last decade, correct it, and with help from Congress turn our attention to the fights we were in. The difference today is that, while such a singular focus made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won’t work for the world we live in.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges – not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both, and we have to have a budget that supports both.  That means funding a force with the right size, readiness, and capabilities to prevail in today’s conflicts while simultaneously building a force that can prevail in the future – recognizing that future force won’t exist unless we take actions today.  That’s what this budget submission was designed to do, and we need your help to do it. I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget; our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, and we hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest risk we face in DoD is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically in the Congress is averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time. By working together, I am confident we can succeed, because in many ways we already have.  If we think back to those defense investments and decisions that changed the course of our nation’s and our military’s history for the better – and not just in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like jointness and the all-volunteer force – they were all able to benefit our security and our society because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations. That same support for what’s in this budget is essential today to address the security challenges we face and seize the opportunities within our grasp.  We need your support in the decisions that our senior military leaders and I are advocating for.  We need you to work with us, and not tie our hands, when it comes to pursuing smart and critical reforms.  And we need you to provide adequate, stable, predictable resources, as only you can, by coming together as you have before – including, in the coming years, to avert the return of sequestration once again.  As long as you do, I know our national security and national strength will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come. Thank you.
